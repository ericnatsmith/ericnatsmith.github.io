This happened at the beginning of the semester.","During our class on Wednesday my instructor mentioned that there are pre reps we can do to catch up. Saying that we can catch up on ‘ prior knowledge'.","Having a pre - requisite course, and strongly encouraging everyone to complete the course modules associated with basic information really helped to \" level the playing field \" so to speak.","2 weeks ago, Dr. [Removed] congratulated us on our first exam and told us generally to not let bad grades bring us down. She said to stay excited for the next exam and if it even helps to not look at a bad grade, then do so to stay motivated for new material.","After the first exam, she made it clear not to worry if you did not do as well as you wanted. She assured us that we would have the opportunity to retake two of our lowest test grades.","This experience happened a couple weeks ago. The instructor was going over announcements and telling us all the resources that are provided to us to succeed, such as the chemistry readiness course, review materials, and extra practice problems. These materials are listed on a module on canvas.","She explained how the material may be harder for other students because of their background in chemistry. Still, she followed up by saying that everyone can understand the information. She said you will understand if you try and put in the work. This happened at the beginning of the school year.","Dr. [Removed] described that we can still be succesful at the beginning of the course even if we didn't take AP [Removed]. This was during the first lecture.","In the start of the semester, she encouraged us to put the effort in the learn the material and that lots of resources would be provided to ensure students, regardless of how much info they're coming in with, can succeed","The professor, on exam or quiz days would encourage us saying that we know the content and we will do just fine on the exam or quiz. She'd try to encourage us to do well by providing us with motivation and encourage us to seek help.","It was towards the beginning of the semester, and I recall being very worried that I was going to struggle to catch up with the rest of my classmates. Dr. [Removed] was reassuring to the whole class that there is many opportunities for us to get help if necessary, and that there are many resources to do so.","We were going over the [Removed] [Removed] in class, and our professor mentioned that this is something we might have touched on in high school chemistry. However, she also mentioned that regardless, there will be some new information and that we are delving deeper into the topic.","Before and After tests, [Removed] has stated that everybody can pass this course if they put the work in. She has mentioned before that it all depends how dedicated you are.","The last time the class had a test she stated that we all possessed the capability to pass the test. The professor also mentions this repeatedly throughout her teaching.","She never says anything that makes the students feel down after receiving bad grades, so I think that's the most important thing here.","When we were learning about [Removed]'s model of an atom and we started to use many concepts from physics. Many students were confused by these terms, but she said that it's ok and that it would get better as we go on, and that even if you didn't know these terms / concepts you would be fine.","I can still succeed in this class even without taking a chem class for several years ; this shows that many people can do it without much prior knowledge.","The instructor not while completely saying the same thing told us that there is room for improvement even if you did poorly on the first test that there s still more which could replace the most recent one. How exactly? I didn't quite understand but she told us this after we got our grades back from the first test.","Through many resources available this is basically implied. There are tutoring hours, discussion posts open 24/7 and review / lecture materials that are always posted.","She pushes everyone to study as much as possible in order to understand. She provides all kinds of resources in order to succeed.","The professor has given us the chance to retake 2 out of the 4 testes at the end of the semester","This happened at the beginning of the course when Dr. [Removed] said that our prior grades do not matter, if we put in the work then we will receive the benefit. [Removed] gave us adequate studying materials and review time to achieve this outcome.","What I appreciate is that Dr. [Removed] values progression over perfection and allowing us to learn this way has been extremely beneficial for my understanding. It alleviates the pressure of getting perfect grades just to get a good grade and it truly makes me understand what is going on. I can apply these concepts to subjects outside of chemistry and I feel like it's making me grow as a student this way.","The professor continuously tells students that the course material is reteachable material from lessons in high school, so those who have no experience in a chemistry class are able to catch up. In addition, she provides us with many chances to get our grades up ased on her grading policies and exam retakes.","[Removed] exams y the end of the semester","Before every unit, Dr. [Removed] explains that although we may have been confused when we saw it in high school ( or even if we didn't see the topic in high school at all ) she was going to make sure to thoroughly explain everything that would be covered.","Within the first few weeks of class, the instructor made it clear that there wasn't much required knowledge, that some students may have and others don't, needed to be successful in the course. The instructor said \" There isn't really any sort of special skills or knowledge you need for the coursework. \"","When discussing the test grade distribution, our teacher mentioned that we can be successful no matter how we do on tests.","She just encouraged people to use the resources better. She said that everyone in this class has potential to do good if they use the resources correctly.","She's stated how the quiz grades have been good and that we can o well on the test. She hasn't stated the part about current knowledge, but believes that we can learn the necessary curriculum","Dr. [Removed] tells us as long as we practice, she is confident we are able to master concepts in her course.","With all the pre class modules I feel like we were brought up to knowledge level. This happened before term started. The instructor has said before each exam that we have been given the tools to succeed.","The way the course is set up provides students the opportunity to improve their grades regardless of their previous scores or if they did poorly in one or two exam units throughout the semester. [Removed] 301 is set up so that students can retake up to 2 exam units for the final, replacing their previous scores. I believe this is a great opportunity for students to showcase that regardless of how badly they did in the past, they can prove if they know the material one more time.","Dr. [Removed] always states that \" we can do this \" while learning material.","Dr [Removed] often says that its easy to get an A in this class if you are able to put the work in and I would say majority of it yet however for someone who didn't have too much [Removed] [Removed] it has been a lot harder but have been trying to push through","N / A","In the last couple weeks she said as long as you put in effort and study the material she gives us, we can do well","They emphasize how taking initiative can putting in the work can lead to success. In addition, they have 2 retake exams for those who maybe did not do well on some exams due to certain circumstances.","Constantly gives us the reassurance and course supplies required to succeed on exams and quizzes. Tells us to practice and gives us material that is curated to perform on exams.","My professor routinley reminds students that their past academic performances does not mean anything. She encourages students to learn study habits and become great students regardless of background.","I think it was last week when Dr. [Removed] was something with atomic theory. She said that even if we haven't taken chemistry in a while, that she is confident we would understand the content by the next hour, and succeed in the units. I don't know if that is exactly applicable to this statement, but I do also feel at some point early she said we would succeed in the course if we go to office hours, practice active learning skills, and study in groups.","When we were preparing for last week's quiz, she said that anyone could be successful as long as we applied ourselves to learning the material both in and out of class.","Dr. [Removed] has emphasized that with enough effort no matter who you are, you will be able to succeed in the course.","More additional support on grading system, missing grades and more.","When lecturing, Dr. [Removed] reminds us that we will be able to do well in this course. She constantly gives us positive messages","She just encourages us properly.","My instructor explained to the class that as long as you pay attention to class and study outside of class, you will succeed in the course. This happens almost weekly, especially before a quiz or exam.","It was during the first week of school. It was pretty reassuring to know that even with a lack of prior chemistry knowledge I could still succeed.","It was either the 1st or 2nd class period for this class. Dr. [Removed] made it very clear that although we may have taken chemistry in high school and even if we didn't then we could still get a good grade if we try. After this she's done a very good job or simplifying everything enough to where if you hadn't taken chemistry before then you could still understand it.","Before quizzes and the first exam, Dr. [Removed] would reassure the class that we have the knowledge to succeed. The class would go into an uproar of panic and she would try to calm us down by telling us that we have everything we need to be successful.","Dr. [Removed] started class by explaining that she understands everyone is on different levels with their knowledge of chemistry. She said that regardless of your extent of knowledge, as long as you study the prerequisite topics and work hard in class to use resources for studying, you will be ok.","They discussed this after the first exam. They explained that their performance was indicative of their effort, and listed options to succeed on the next exam.","Not anything in specific situations, but Dr. [Removed] frequently emphasized that all students could succeed in the course, regardless of their background.","Mrs. [Removed] tells us about resources that we can use that will help on quizzes and exams. These often include practice problems or learning modules.","She reviewed everything from high school","I don't remember.","Professor [Removed] has told us 2 - 3 times ( spaced throughout the duration of the course thus far ) that the course is designed to allow us to learn from our mistakes in our exams. More specifically, there are two opportunities to retake an exam in case a student does not receive a grade that they are happy with. Dr. [Removed] explained that this method allows us to learn from our mistakes and learn the best study techniques that will help us succeed in [Removed] 301 and in future, more rigorous courses.","She said that even if we didn't take chemistry in high school, office hours can help us catch up on information we learned and even if others did already learn something she goes in depth into the material for those whom did not.","During the first lecture and consistently throughout the course, Dr. [Removed] emphasized that every student has the potential to succeed in chemistry, regardless of their prior knowledge or grades. She reassured us by saying that the course was designed with various support structures, like review sessions, office hours, and supplementary resources, to help everyone master the material.","I do think the instructor told us at very start of the course near the start of the semester and right after the first exam, trying to encourage students and giving energies. Both were in class.","This happens like every lecture and she will address the subject if the class does well on an instapoll question usually.","She mentions how some people might be familiar with certain subjects but also addresses them thoroughly to where people who have never seen them can get a handle on it.","When we first started, Dr. [Removed] told us we could all pass the course as long as we put in the effort. She also, explained that it did not matter our past in [Removed], but it mattered what we did now to learn it.","Professor [Removed] gives students all the resources they need to succeed in the class, on quizzes and exams. She goes through all the content well and tells us frequently that we can succeed if we just learn her little mnemonics/ use those resources","The instructor said that all students can succeed regardless of their grades on the class after our second midterm because you can retake two exams for the final.","Expressed that students come in with different previous chemistry knowledge, but that anyone can master the class if they study a little bit every day.","Dr. [Removed] has never acted like she didn't believe in us. She mentions a lot right after tests that no matter what happened we would be able to move forward so long as we chose to. She also mentions that she has lots of resources and that there are lots of office hours as well as study groups available for us to go to if we need it, and never makes us feel stupid for having to use those resources.","She says to keep trying even if you are struggling, there are resources to help and excel in the class.","Professor [Removed] always ensures us that there are effective ways of taking in the information she gives. She always provides learning modules as well as videos for explanations of those problems and she is also very helpful in office hours since she reviews topics more in depth.","After the exam, the professor stated that your score doesn't impact how good you are at a subject and talked about redemption opportunities as well as an easier chemistry course we could transfer into","Recommends different learning strategies to be successful. Goes over basic ways that students can ensure success in class","She hasn't states those words exactly, but she does emphasize to use all the resources if we feel that we have gaps in our knowledge. Thus her underlying message seems to be that if we try we can success regardless of our prior knowledge.","Dr. [Removed] always makes it clear that there are resources to help if prior chemistry knowledge is lacking. Additionally, she provided information on an alternative course that could be taken if needed.","With the third exam approaching, she had a talk with all the students. She mentioned that everybody still had a chance to improve their grades by taking advantage of the full extent of all the resources available.","The instructor would thoroughly explain the course material, which is very helpful for students who didn't have much experience with chemistry.","There's many opportunities to improve the grade","She regularly states that current learning strategies will have the greatest impact on your performance, regardless of prior knowledge.","She's never said this but she does say we can all suceed","The instructor made it clear that students have access to succeed ( ie canvas review modules ) if they are struggling.","During a lecture over bonding of molecules, Dr. [Removed] went very in - depth to explain the concept and constantly asked for questions from the class and gladly repeated explanations of concepts when asked. These gestures allowed students to not be afraid of uncertainty and allowed her to drill vital chemistry concepts for all chemistry backgrounds.","She kind of says this if there's a topic that was talked about during high school. Even if we don't know about it / we have learned about it but don't remember, she will go through it the same way she would if it was newly introduced.","Dr. [Removed] has done a great job at encouraging us and telling us that we can do whatever we are faced with in her class. She has given us many resources, many words of support, and told us that we can succeed whether or not we have had much experience in chemistry.","Professor [Removed] said before the first midterm that we all could do well. She stated all the resources we had to our avail ( including her ) and assured us we would do well.","It happened after the test, as she said that she's proud of us all and that we are capable of all things if we learn to understand.","I can not recall a moment the instructor did this, but she is very encouraging and says that we will do well on our exams and tests, which has helped me feel more confident and allow me to score better.","On our first day of class, she assured us that we could develop the tools to succeed if we did not have them already. She took us through a mental exercise related to what we are good at now ( e.g., singing, dancing, writing, etc ) and explained how we did not get there overnight. Rather, we needed to develop the skills over time.","The teacher states we need to learn to be able to pass ie knowledge is integral to success \n","Since the course is a general chemistry course, much of the material is tailored for people who have never been exposed to this level of chemistry. Additionally, the practice problems and learning modules progressively   become more difficult, which allows for students to work upward and build knowledge instead of assume what they know.","I agree because we are provided in dept descriptions of all the topics that we learned in class and we go over the topic again in class in detail. The modules and the extra practice helps make the topics more understanding.","She has reminded this from the beginning of this course. She made us reassured as it is also optional homework to catch up or re - learn some topics, and she does some review in her lectures. She has done some, but not all, but it is covered over her learning modules. She did encourage us not to worry as there are many resources available to us","After the first unit test she offered a lot of encouragement and reassurance that even if you didn't do so well in this test you can still succeed. There are a lot of resources that can make a huge difference.","Dr. [Removed] did say this statement at the beginning of the year during syllabus week, as she was introducing the class. Though throughout the course she has provided us with helpful tools and study materials that set us up to succeed if we put an effort into the class.","Dr [Removed] has repeated multiple times that one bad grade does not define you, mentions retakes for exams multiple times per unit, and also reviews material covered in AP chem","Dr. [Removed] is extremely encouraging every class. She is constantly uplifting her students and has their best interest at heart. She not only cares about our learning, but she cares about us as students and makes it a point to put herself in our shoes.","My instructor made it very clear that she is aware we come from various academic backgrounds but that we all belong in the class. she said this at the start of the course. She used affirming words indicating that we all belong, and if we do struggle she has numerous resources for us to use in order to succeed. She also has recently mentioned that even through using the resources and the office hour help, if you are still struggling, there is an alternative class route you can take.","At the beginning of the course she made it clear that everyone has the chance to do well in this course","Nothing in particular has made be believe this, just the classes in general.","I think it's because it's a basic introductory class, so it's simple to get on track with. She said that you can succeed if you are on top of your learning.","She always discusses how our study techniques and willingness to do well is very important. She believes in us putting ion effort to understanding the concept and focusing on understanding it rather than just doing well. She also will let us redo a previous exam for our final to help us better succeed in our class and prove that we have mastered the material.","Our professor told us that we can retake tests which shows that you have a chance to improve even if you didn't come into the class with prior chem knowledge","The Professor just stated that we are all doing good and not to give up on anything and to just always asks for help whenever we needed it.","This happened in the beginning of the course, maybe the first class or so. I don't recall any other instances besides that.","Dr. [Removed] always makes a point of showing her students all of the resources for success that are available within the course. She makes a point of ensuring students that if we used these resources, we will succeed because they are designed to help us.","The instructor offers encouragement throughout lectures and builds off of what she has taught in class. She also provides resources for those who do not have prior knowledge to review fundamental skills.","She is very understanding that some students do not have prior chemistry knowledge and accommodates this by emphasizing the importance of practice problems and walking us through why we get the answers we do.","Dr. [Removed] said at the beginning of the semester that anyone can succeed regardless if they took AP chemistry in high school.","She congratulates people on completing previous exams and consistently affirms how we're building on past material and that most are on track. She talks about polling, quiz grades, etc. to show us that we're on track and that as a whole people are doing well ( despite different backgrounds ). She talks about this frequently and reassures students a lot.","Dr. [Removed] always motivates her students to push [Removed] regardless of grades.","Dr. [Removed] doesn't specifically relate previous grades or knowledge to current success, but she states that everybody is capable of succeeding by making an effort to practice chemistry content even just for a few minutes every single day.","My professor mentioned this during a lecture about a month ago. I do not remember.","All she said was that if we completed the chemistry modules we could succeed in the course. Dr [Removed] gives everyone enough resources to succeed in the course with zero background knowledge.","Mrs. [Removed] has stated during quizzes and exams that we can all succeed with the right amount of work. I don't remember specifically when but during times when she can tell we're nervous she tells us that we know this and to trust ourselves.","She is very encouraging and does a good job of making sure that we know we can succeed. She encourages us to look over prior material if we have not already.","She goes through a lot of things from the beginning, I didn't know much coming in and I have been fine","We had chem modules we had to do before the class","[Removed] always emphasizes that regardless of our standings or mistakes in the course, she believes we can all learn from our mistakes and all succeed through personal hard work and perserverence. this emphahsis and community makes it a lot easier to succeed.","Dr. [Removed] explained that no matter what grades we have gotten we can always begin to alter our methods to achieve a higher grade and that we have the potential to do so. This was last week at the beginning of a lecture.","The course is very easy to follow, and the instructor makes very clear, what to expect for exams and quizzes.","Dr. [Removed] introduces the material as new topics that any student can be fully capable of learning. She makes the course as a course that anyone can be successful in.","Dr. [Removed] has told the class before that she tries to prepare us during lectures for assignments and tests.","Our instructor references ideas that we may have learned in prior years, but she still reminds us that we have resources to use if we don't have prior knowledge. For example, she provides practice resources in the learning modules to stay up to date with skills.","Dr. [Removed] encouraged everyone to study for exams and provided reminders of the replacement exams. The reminders of the replacement exams helped me to feel less stressed.","The instructor never specifically said that we will not succeed if we have no prior knowledge or experience within the course. She gives anyone who had or has little to no knowledge of the course the means to succeed through the materials and the refreshers on past knowledge they may have missed.","This course is a hands on course with an attendance policy. I think taking [Removed] before this helps but is not necessary to pass this course because it's mainly application. [Removed] walks everyone through how to do each step in the procedure and clearly says what he is looking for.","They will review if anything is unfamiliar and to ask if you need more help.","At the first lab, [Removed] and [Removed] assured us that they would guide us throughout the course.","Mentioned in the first class that with or without prior lab knowledge we would succeed in the class","She made sure we know that we can answer the questions on the quizzes to the best of our ability and that she would give partial credit for doing so.","Not sure what was said specifically, but it was heavily implied that all students can succeed in the course regardless of their current knowledge / current grades.","We do not talk about grading much in class but what is necessary to get a good grade is outlined for us.","I just think that science research can be intimidating sometimes but how they put it into parts that is easily digestible, it really makes me feel like I can do it. Not that they were really stated it, but they expect everyone to be able to complete it.","The instructor knew that most of us were new to researching techniques and always helped us during class","In my bio lab course, the instructor emphasized that all students could succeed, regardless of their prior knowledge or background. During the first week, the instructor said, \" It doesn't matter how much experience you have coming in — what matters is your effort and engagement in this class. \" This was particularly encouraging before we started our experiments, making everyone feel supported and confident, even if they were new to lab work.","N / a","Have provided all information needed and explained that this course can be accomplished by all.","The instructor constantly helps students out and provides meaningful assistant. They are also always available to discuss matters.","Everything was mated out in the course so that past knowledge didn't matter as much as just being on task and wanting to learn.","Bahar always makes it clear that we can do well in the class. She encourages us to try.","At the first lab they said they teach no matter what you already know. They think we will do good if we try.","Our instructor is very clear that we'll be able to get a good grade based on our ability to complete tasks, which are described in details. This happened throughout the semester.","The TA is nice and approachable and does not give you the perspective that you need to have prior knowledge to get a good grade.","I am not sure if this was said or not, there is a lot said during lecture and I have difficulty staying focused","I am not exactly sure, but it is an introductory course so it feels this way.","The TAs and professor are always very encouraging and bring a positive energy to all of our lab meetings.","i don't remember","Encouragement and extra credit","She told us that all of the skills and procedures we need to know will be taught before performing it on our soil samples. This happened at the beginning of the semester as well.","Sawyer was very encouraging and stated at the beginning of the semester when going over the course schedule and syllabi that this course is for everyone.","The instructor would tell us that we are all capable of doing good in the course as long as we did what was expected of us. She told us that prior knowledge isn't a huge deal and that we can learn what we need to for this course.","Instructor gives good affirmations while group is working on experiment. She motivates us and gives us feedback on our lab notebook.","Our pre lab scores 2 of them get dropped showing that we can succeed no matter out grades","This is a beginning bio lab, and a lot of us have never done any of these procedures before, and we are always reassured that if we don't know something, we will never get in trouble for asking. It is heavily emphasized that you can't become a master at anything without ever doing it, and this is a course about exploration.","This might be your first lab but this course is made to give you a starting taste of what a real research lab experience would feel like. We will give you all the necessary resources and help to succeed in this course in many ways.","I think near the beginning of the semester, and throughout different labs, she mentioned how everyone starts at different places. Based on that, she makes sure to have everyone practice to avoid mistakes and improve our skills. She has a very positive attitude towards learning / growing","My professor has said on multiple occasions that we all the potential to do well in her course and keeps the vibe very low - stress.","On the first day, Dr. [Removed] talked about the growth mindset. She told us intelligence is not necessarily something you are born with ; it is something you develop.","The instructor careful explains complicated university - level topics, and she provides numerous resources / lecture slides before each class. She allows multiple - attempt, open - note quizzes, giving students the chance to make mistakes and learn simultaneously.","The teacher was explaining how this class can be overwhelming at times because of how fast we cover content ; however, she reminds us that she understand that we all come from different education backgrounds. She encouraged us to continue to work hard and that she believes that all of us can acquire a growth mindset and perform well in this class.","At the beginning of each class and at the end Dr [Removed] will give us some type of motivational message about how we might be struggling, but that it means that we're learning.","During the first week of school, we had a class dedicated to growth mindset and the ideology that our knowledge isn't necessarily fixed nor is it predetermined by our past performance. She used a variety of videos and her own personal anecdotes to get this point across.","One of my favorite things about Dr. [Removed] are the frequent positive [Removed] messages she sends out to the entire class. These messages are extremely encouraging and tell us to keep looking forward and improve instead of getting stuck on a possible past grade.","When speaking about the grades of the previous exam we have taken, the professor emphasized that most of us did better than in the first exam while others were stagnant. She encouraged us to reach out if we ever needed help or were confused and that we can still get our grades up for the class.","After a stressful assignment or more typically an exam Dr. [Removed] will reassure us that one exam is not what determines our intelligence and grade for the semester. She typically follows this by providing options for different things we can do to improve such as student hours time, practice problems, or exam reviews.","Dr. [Removed] constantly sends out encouraging messages. Before and after each exam she reminds people not to stress and that the outcome doesn't determine their value.","Whenever we have an exam as well as after, Dr. [Removed] always sends out a notice about how we should try our best and that no matter the result as long as we tried hard there is always next time. Something around that idea.","She told us at the beginning of the year that we would do well.","After each exam, Dr. [Removed] will send out an announcement about the test and encourage us to evaluate how we feel about the learning now that the unit has concluded. She'll also always emphasize how one test will not determine our whole semester and that there's always room for improvement for the rest of the course.","I don't know exactly what she said but in the beginning of class one time I think she said this explicitly but she definitely makes us feel this way \n","After each exam, Dr. [Removed] offers one on one sessions to review our test and she reminds us that one test is not reflective o0f our intelligence or ability to perform on future tests. She sends an encouraging announcement which really helped me succeed and ace the next exam when I did not do as great the first time around.","Advises us always to ask questions if we don't understand lessons and provides materials to help improve our abilities.","She always touches on how different people come from different biology backgrounds and each person has a different foundation. However, she still tells us that we can do well in the course as long as we put in full effort and do all the assignments.","Verbally stated anyone can succeed with a growth mindset and did a mini - lecture about a growth mindset on the first or second day of lecture.","Professor [Removed] has many opportunities for extra credit, and the assignments for the class are designed to promote growing your knowledge and learning. For example, our homework assignments are graded on completion ( and if it is evident we put effort into answering the questions ) rather than solely if the answers are right or wrong. This makes it a lot more comfortable to do assignments instead of constantly being worried about grades, and the feedback from getting a question wrong is very helpful!","She often states in class that everyone is coming from a different background. She also often send encouraging methods that states anyone can improve.","The instructors have repeatedly sent out announcements, typically around once per week or once every two weeks, reminding students that they can succeed with proper strategies if they continue to put effort into the course. Typically, this is a virtual announcement, although this has also been mentioned in lecture a couple of times.","Dr. [Removed] frequently sends out encouraging messages through the announcements and lets everyone know that they are capable of succeeding in class as well as reminding everyone to stay healthy ( eat well, get enough sleep, etc. ).","Dr. [Removed] is very encouraging and has told my class that everyone has the potential to learn and grow in genetics. After exam grades were posted, she emphasized that learning will take time and effort and we can all improve, no matter what grade we got on the exam.","In the beginning of the school year, she stated that by employing the right study strategies, going to student hours, and giving the appropriate amount of time and work, we can all be successful in the class. She's also provided multiple opportunities to allow students who might be behind to catch up, such as extra classes surrounding statistics and optional modules to drill the material we learn.","Dr. [Removed] frequently encourages us as students to keep trying hard for understanding even if we feel discouraged. She recently let us know that we still have a chance to do well in her course, even if the first exam went poorly because there are many other opportunities to demonstrate improvement.","The professor let us know that we can all succeed through asking questions.","The instructor constantly uplifted us and reminded us that we were all capable of learning and understanding the material.","She sent out announcements encouraging studying or other assistance available. \n.","Dr. [Removed] makes an effort to emphasize that there are various resources to succeed and makes herself available to aid in student learning.","She encourages us to do encouraging and positive reflective assignments and sends out weekly kind emails checking in on us. I [Removed] [Removed]. [Removed] WE ALL [Removed] [Removed]. [Removed].","Dr. [Removed] is very encouraging and makes sure acknowledge that her students come from various educational backgrounds in which some students will grasp material quicker than others. Additionally, she is also very encouraging regarding have the right study techniques when preparing for exams.","The instructor and the TAs all are very motivating especially after exams, making sure you know you are able succeed in the class","She said that as long as you put in the work, success in the class is attainable! The instructor especially reminds the students of such through encouraging emails.","Dr. [Removed] encourages her students to know they can succeed in the course regardless of their past.","We have talked about growth mindset, and I think during that she states all students can succeed.","While this bio course is upper division, Dr. [Removed] makes it easy to ask questions and get any help we need. She always tells us to ask questions and lets us interrupt if we need her to explain something.","Our professor stated that students should come to office hours and engage with the LA's and TA's in order to gain a better understanding of the material.","He said that even though people had not so pleasant experiences with physics in the past, they can still succeed.","He always emphasizes that your lack of knowledge doesn't define you.","The instructor shares that it is important to have a growth mindset and learn from our mistakes and that they do not define us. Furthermore he shares that you can still come back from any negative grades.","Explains everything like it's our first time, discusses the problem, and explains what happens","[Removed] was going through a survey that we had filled out, and he explained to us that everyone has the accessibility to resources that can help us succeed. Overall, he simply encouraged us!","He always explains this before we have an exam coming up. He said it is within our ability to do better.","He said this on the first day of class.","Dr. [Removed] emphasized how everyone can succeed in physics at the beginning. He also applauded how far we have gotten in the course, and how we have all became at least a bit more knowledgeable since the start of the semester. After the exams, he has us reflect on our exams, and he encourages us in the following classes to have a growth mindset. Honestly, physics is just really tough, and I don't come to each class as prepared as I should be. I don't think anyone else is either, so I do appreciate Dr. [Removed] trying to ease us into material despite us not always knowing what's going on. He encourages us to come to office hours and ask questions. He tries to help us succeed and believe in ourselves. These talks usually happen at the beginning of class, or they happen outside of class through [Removed] surveys.","At the beginning of this course this was something he discussed. He gave us some review assignments that were optional and has helped me throughout the class.","We recently had our second midterm and the class overall didn't do well but the professor was still encouraging and gave the students an opportunity to learn and do better on the material covered in the midterm.","it was one of the first topics and it is on the top of our syllabus","He always states that everyone in the class has the potential to succeed regardless of what prior experience they had with physics. For me personally, I did not take physics in high school so it is more of a learning curve for me because all the content is new. But he was saying that there are plenty of people who succeed in the course without the prior experience.","After the second mid terms results came out! “ Cancer there are many people who are trying to solve hard issues around the world ”","We were going over the mditerm and the professor reminds us that we are all capable of doing well","After revealing the score distributions for the second exam, the professor reassured us as a class that we could improve.","Tells students they can succeed.","He encourages us to learn from our mistakes. He says that he failed classes and exams in college too and was still able to be successful.","There was no experience of this scenario.","He teaches it in a way that s understandable for beginners. While the test questions tend to be more difficult, however, its easy to follow along during class","He mentioned at the beginning of the semester that he wants us all to succeed and also has us complete reflections as progress through the course.","It was simply just a statement at the beginning of the semester what we are all capable of learning and doing well. we then continued the class","Dr. [Removed] was discussing how important having a growth mindset is to succeed in the class. This happened during the first weeks of class.","He dedicated the first part of the class to assuring us that no matter how we did on the test, it isn't the end of the world. He said that regardless of our performance on the exam, we are not failures.","Dr. [Removed] engages by asking questions in class and doesn't make us feel dumb if we answer incorrectly. I like that when he asks us questions it's also a way to see how much we grasp a subject. He encourages us to do the readings before class and even if we haven't taken a physics course in years, he teaches us by also going over the basics. He doesn't expect us to know everything and I like that he encourages questions if we don't understand something as simple as what a coefficient stands for.","Dr. [Removed] is adamant that any student can succeed in his course if they put in the effort. He consistently emphasizes the use of an open mindset.","Our professor believes that we can all succeed with an A in his course which is actually stated in his syllabus. During class he is very active in encouraging discussion and learning together.","After our last exam Dr. [Removed] let us know that despite the grade we got we can still succeed in the course and end off with an A or B even if we messed up on the first exam.","It was the first day of classes and he was going over the syllabus explaining how the classes would go. He assured us that everyone can learn how to do physics and that regardless of what our current knowledge was, it is possible to succeed. He also got us on [Removed] discussion so that he could see what people's experiences with physics was.","There was no specific event that occurred, but the overall atmosphere is positive and encouraging most of the time.","The instructor emphasizes the \" growth mindset \" weekly. This last week we had an exam that did not go so well, but instead of curving we got to retake it with half credit points back.","Again, focused on highlighting growth mindset. Told us we can learn no matter our background.","Promotes growth mindset","Dr. [Removed] uses his growth mindset model quite a few times to show us how we can succeed.","Dr. [Removed] showed us a graph that depicted what its like learning a hard topic like physics. He related this graph to us who may be struggling with the material who feel like giving up to remind us that the breakthrough to success is almost here.","He constantly promotes a growth mindset and explains that you can improve despite tests scores or previous experiences there is always time to learn more and get better.","Every class he tells us to have a growth mindset, we can improve on our failures. Improving or taking responsibility over the the things you can control.","He always says that we still have potential to succeed after an exam","Dr. [Removed] always encourages us to put in work, but provides many opportunities to improve our grade. He says that it doesn't matter if we took AP [Removed], or have taken biology before.","Within the first couple class Dr. [Removed] said that difference between previous knowledge from AP Bio students and people who are learning these concepts for the first time wasn't significant. It didn't matter if you had previous knowledge in the class and that you can do well with the right studying strategies.","In our first lecture hour, Dr. [Removed] told us all that it did not matter if we had taken AP [Removed] in the past - he has had students succeed and get good grades even without this past experience. He reiterated this fact several times during that first lecture.","The practice problems help with the exams.","After we took our first exam, Dr. [Removed] told us that we all did well and passed our first exam. He also told us that regardless of our grades, we still have many chances to improve our grades, and this first exam will allow us to have a feel for what his exams look like. He also told us that if we do not understand how to study, we can ask him for tips.","I don't remember","Sata makes sure to let people know that it is not how much a student knows or memorizes but how they can apply what they know and be creative, it is not purely how smart or proifceint one is at memorizing information.","After the exam, he explains that grades don't define us, but anyone who seeks to improve them can find resources and talk to him.","On the first day of class, the professor acknowledged that students may have varying degrees of [Removed] background from AP to honors to regular [Removed]. However, he explained that it is possible for everyone to succeed in his class by using effective study strategies to understand and apply the content.","it was right after the first and second exams. he said good job to those who did well, and that it was still possible to do decent in the class.","He gives us learning outcomes before each test and never talks about advantages of any content learned in highschool. This allows every students to start and feel like they are starting from the same spot and have the same resources to study for the exams.","I know that on the first lecture he stated how this class required no previous knowledge","Yes, he told us several times prior knowledge does not help you. You learn everything you need to in class for the tests.","I remember the professor recently excitedly saying to us how much we have learned to come this far during one lesson.","She knows people come from different coding backgrounds. She accommodates most students,","She mentioned that this course could be taken at any skill level with [Removed]","Dr. [Removed] explained that no prior knowledge of R [Removed] was needed.","Does in instapolls","My professor was encouraging us that we are all able to do well in this class.","At the beginning of the course the professor mentioned that there is no prior knowledge of programming or R to succeed in the course. The professor didn't mention grades.","Prefaced early on that R knowledge is not needed to do well in this course, strictly learning environment.","Said in class","Allows for many opportunities for students to ask questions about their code for homework and projects.","This was said during the beginning of the term and was went to show that your prior coding knowledge did not matter, this class was intended for all levels of knowledge.","Our professor provided information about how regardless of previous programming knowledge we would be able to succeed in the course.","At the beginning of the semester, professor [Removed] made it clear that this course was designed in a way that anyone with any level of programming experience should be able to take this course.","I don't really remember, I think it was some time during the beginning of the semester when we were going over the syllabus. She did emphasize that we can all succeed.","First day of class","She has stated in class and on the course page that we did not need to have any prior experience","She always emphasizes that the class is doable for anyone","She teaches from the basics","Dr. [Removed] is very encouraging of students. She takes all questions and responses, and helps guide you to the right approach to a problem.","No matter the amount of coding experience we have Professor [Removed] has made sure to level the playing field and proivde resources for everyone.","The instructor has stated that the grades we make at this point in the class will not determine our final grade. If we change up and learn from our mistakes we can obtain our ideal goal.","During the first week. Professor [Removed] said that it was okay to never have taken a statistics class or used [Removed] before.","The instructor told us that we could still learn everything we needed to learn and get a good grade in the class regardless of our past knowledge.","My professor said regardless of if you took AP [Removed] in high school, you can do well in this class. She also said that you are going to start at the beginner level when using R - [Removed] and that you do not need to have prior knowledge for this.","When starting more difficult topics the instructor used real - life examples to show us that it is easy if we think about it like that. She tells us that the lesson is simple as long as you understand.","It doesn't matter if we have taken AP [Removed]. Everyone is starting from the same palce \n","I don't remember exactly, but I'm sure Prof. [Removed] said something to that effect at the beginning of the semester.","The professor began the class with a review of vocabulary needed for the semester and later progressed to logic charts that served as examples to help students understand how to think through probability problems. While some other courses have left me feel like I am behind on the first day, this class had a very smooth transition where I was able to clearly understand how to do the problem solving that was required of me.","At the beginning of the year, she made it pretty clear that our class was manageable ( even if students struggled with math in the past ).","She again is just generally encouraging of students in the course. She provides lots of extra review for students that need it, and extra credit opportunities. She never makes the class feel as though they are behind during lecture.","She gives us opportunities to grow and learn more.","She always mentions how we have improved as we have gone through the course and how she knows we can still improve regardless of how we were doing in the past. As well as she is available for when we need her.","it was during the first week of school when she said it was a intro class so eveyone had a chance of passing","This was stated to help encourage students that they didn't need to take AP [Removed] in high school to do well in this class.","Can't remember a precise detail","In my course, dr thijs emphasized that all students could succeed regardless of their prior knowledge or grades before the first test. she said this and followed up by sharing resources and strategies to support our learning throughout the semester.","After our first exam the instructor sent an email that basically stated this in very similar words. Since the grades ranged and some people probably did not score where they expected, the instructor stated that the first exam is typically a learning experience. \n","In the beginning of the semester, she said during lecture that taking evolution was perferred. She said that this would not greatly hinder anyone's grades.","She gave confidence to us by instructing us well in the material, and doing reviews before exams, i can not think of any specific quotes.","She sent out an announcement after the exam letting people know if they did not do well, they need to find new study strategies.","There was a topic that was covered in intro biology, but she went over it again in case we were uncomfortable with our amount of knowledge on that subject.","at the beginning of the school year. if you study and stay on top of things","Instructor makes sure students know prior knowledge is not required \n P","At the befriending of class when staring the class structure and objectives and how we could succeed","At the beginning of this course, this idea that anyone could succeed regardless of past academic performance was emphasized","After every exam, the instructor states that we are all capable of learning and mastering the material if we know how to study and put in effort.","She basically reiterated after the first exam that everyone can succeed and improve moving forward.","The professor constantly talks about how we can always improve with finding new strategies and has a lot of help options in case you haven't seen certain topics before and need more help","At the beginning of class, before we started the lecture material, she reaffirmed us that physics is hard yet we can all succeed in the course. She encouraged us to have a growth mindset.","Our professor has told us many times of her own struggles and how she failed tests in physics class herself, but it didn't stop her from pursuing the subject and excelling in it. She always emphasized that students can always learn more and grow in their physics journey.","Dr. [Removed] frequently shares personal experiences as a woman in the physics world and as a student in physics. She also shares how we are capable of mastering physics and that we are not born with knowledge, we gain it through experience.","Our instructor discusses our successes despite maybe feeling discouraged despite our poor grades at the beginning of the semester","So far, the instructor has provided us numerous opportunities to learn through the homeworks and the textbook. She told us this a few times during the first weeks of classes. Since then, there is no mention of it and the statements made have not been reiterated.","Started off the lecture with her personal story of physics being hard. Then said that you don't need to be a perfect student to understand physics.","The professor shared and sympathized with us on how difficult the course can be and did her best to reassure us.","[Removed] always talks of her own personal struggles and relates them to the students. She explains that she was once like us, a student, and has worked her way through physics, and anyone of us can too.","After our Unit 1 test, professor [Removed] told us we all did well and encouraged us to keep trying in the class","She was telling us that this course to be difficult, towards the beginning of the semester. She then told us how physics was difficult for her as well when she first began to learn it, and this made us feel better because she knew the struggles of not understanding the topics when she first started, and gave us hope that even if we didn't understand it at first, with practice we could master the topics.","She has stated that our grade is about staying determined to learn and putting in effort, not about past knowledge or grades","Almost every class Professor [Removed] emphasizes growth mindset. She always reminds us that we are all capable of succeeding in the course if we put in the effort to learn and grow.","She always talks about how we can improve and that we just need to practice more if we want to succeed. Nothing about how we can't get better and lets us retake test to show our growth.","Generally occurs in preparation of or after a test. The prof highlights how we all came from different backgrounds of physics which leads to a bigger learning curve while studying or a broader grade distribution and there's always ways to improve.","He allows for retest of each midterm for a better grade, and encouraged us to take the retest even if we already had a good grade. He wants us to learn the material which is why each midterm is a very small portion of the grade.","After exam 1 grades were released he told us how he bombed his first physics exam and how we could recover if we did the same. He also was proud of our exam 1 grades.","He says that there are certain things you have to know coming into this class ( prereqs ), but overall he says you don't need to much prior knowledge to do well in this class. It is not a necessity to know those things but it is extremely beneficial.","He is very encouraging and very enthusiastic about how all of the students can succeed. He gives a pep talk to us weekly it seems like. It is very encouraging for a professor to do this.","He showed us through personal example that the grades we get here and on the first test by no means are a determining factor of our future success in [Removed] and he told us the low grade he got on his first physics test. He told us this right before or after the test.","This happened when we learn new material that some people have already learned in high school, but he always reminds us that it's not a big deal and that we can still learn everything no matter what. He also gave us an instapoll one time showing up how he failed physics the first time he took it and obviously he's a physics professor now, so it's a very nice sentiment.","The instructor told us how he failed his first physics exam, to make us feel better about learning.","He talked about his first grade on a physics exam and had us guess. This was a nice moment to show us that we are not defined by a moment, but a series of choices","Professor gives many opportunities for makeup like the make up exams, hw drops, extra credit surveys etc","After exams, my instructor is always encouraging towards those who didn't do as well and reassures them that they can still pass the class.","Professor gives retest every week to ensure students can learn from their mistakes. These test have been very beneficial to me.","Once the grades from tests come out, he always supports students who got low grades and states that more help from TAs and some help from himself would help the students get better grades. He also told the entire class that he did very bad in his first physics exam and told students not to stress over one exam.","This was in the first week of class. He was talking to us and having us reflect on how we feel about physics as a class in general and to not be too fearful. He said that just because you get a bad exam grade doesn't mean that you're bad at physics, it just is a snap shot of your knowledge at the time and doesn't define the future.","He tells us that our past knowledge can help us but we don't need it to succeed. I don't know when he said this but I think it was at the beginning of the semester.","Midterm. Last week on Wednesday. He said this is only a snapshot of our learning and we can still make up some points so our grades are still within reach","His policy on test corrections displays this. He says current knowledge in an exam does not reflect future potential.","Professor [Removed] is good about providing helpful information to ensure that any student, regardless of their situation or creed, can learn effectively. For instance, he explains using linear algebra concepts how to verify that the process of solving an equation is mathematally correct, and teaches us to recognize if an answer makes physical sense.","I believe it was directly mentioned in the beginning of the course, but the atmosphere has been very positive towards learning throughout.","Near the beginning, he talked about how this class would help us learn this difficult subject. He also described his own past experiences after the first exam.","This was talked about when we started the course at the beginning of the term. The instructor was basically laying out that we can be successful in the course and there will be many resources to help us along if we are having trouble with a subject.","She stopped the lecture to tell us that as long as we put the effort into this course, we should be able to succeed no matter how much knowledge you have. This happened during the first couple classes.","Before quizzes, our professor tells us throughout the week and before we begin the assignment that we have the skills to study and perform well on the quiz.","After our first quiz we were cogratulated. It felt nice to be recognized of your hard work.","She always encourage us to do out best.","she make sures we understand basic concepts before getting more complex.","Professor [Removed] does things in a way in which you have the opportunity to understand the material without prior knowledge. She presents new information in a way where you have the opportunity to learn through hadnouts, lecture slides, and discussion!","I think she made it clear that even though we come from a range of physics knowledge, that we could all succeed.","The instructor mentioned that the course is designed for individuals without any physics background.","She goes through all examples thouroughly, also put questions on the exams like the homework","She has explicitly stated she does not want people to be discouraged by any previous grades they have gotten. This occurred after exam one.","Professor acknowledges that physics is difficult and takes practice. Our course content is university level and therefore not always straightforward.","The class is taught very well and thoroughly. You need no prior knowledge of physics to do well in this class but it wouldn't hurt.","At the beginning of the semester, Dr. [Removed] told us that everything we need to know will be taught in this course. He said our previous knowledge in AP [Removed] from high school is not necessary to succeed in his course.","In the first day of class, Dr. [Removed] said that regardless of whatever terms we applied to concepts will probably be wrong and that he would teach the appropriate terms and knowledge of such concepts.","This specific course is more attendance based than assignment based, so she's made it pretty clear that we'll pass as long as we show up. However, a lot of her lectures give some insight into how to succeed in other, more challenging classes which is really nice.","It was made clear that grades do not define our potential as a professional and that you don't have to be perfect or have amazing grades to be successful.","Towards the beginning of the semester our instructor really emphasized that you can succeed whether or not you have the current knowledge. You will learn as you go.","She has emphasized that there's always room to improve and you can learn better if you change or try new ways to study","As we're nearing the end of the semester [Removed] always congratulates us on how far we've made it. This is without any mention of how high school or past grades effect us.","At the beginning of the year, [Removed] set her expectations for us to follow. We were to just listen and take in the information we learned which are traits anyone can have.","Dr. [Removed] explained on the first day that it didn't matter if you took high school physics, AP, or college level, anyone could succeed in his course. One thing that made a really good impression on me is that Dr. [Removed] admitted to failing a physics course in his schooling, which made it a lot easier to relate to him, and I knew he was down to earth and genuinely a good person.","Emphasizes that we can succeed on the exams by studying and going to office hours.","I remember when starting our new unit Professor [Removed] expressed how even though it may be hard for students first learning this material that they would just have to work a tad harder but could still get better and keep up with everyone else. At the start of the year I think I remember how he said that no matter what was happening the TAs and our classmates could help else out if we didn't know what was going on.","The instructor was describing some of his past experiences when introducing himself and mentioned that he himself failed an undergraduate class and had to retake it. Despite this failure he was able to become quite a successful scientist and professor.","Early in the semester Dr. [Removed] encouraged everyone after the first midterm to keep studying and not give up on the course. He mentioned that everyone has a chance to do good in the class, regardless of previous grades.","Every class, we are shown a letter from a previous student, using anecdotal evidence to help us feel more secure as physics students. Dr. [Removed] will read this letter to the class and give her thoughts","Shares previous student's challenges and how they overcame them \n","The instructor gives us checkpoint quizes and they help us to identify gaps in our knowledge. This way allows us to succeed in the course regardless of our backgrounds.","During lecture, [Removed] explained that students were coming i m with different knowledge backgrounds but that this course was designed to get everyone on the same level &amp; everyone can succeed if enough effort is put in","Professor [Removed] always has segments before class where she shares a story from a past student. Many of these involve students who did not believe they could succeed based on their prior knowledge. Professor [Removed] makes sure to teach us otherwise.","The instructor often shares experiences from past students and quite often mentions that students with limited prior knowledge can achieve good grades after their hard work.","Professor frequently reviews letters about past students failures as well as her own. She always states how failing is an essential part of learning and it shouldn't be something to fear.","At the beginning of each class, she let's us read about students from previous years who succeeded with no background physics knowledge.","Every class, lecture slides before class","Dr. [Removed] tells us about struggle stories from her past students and would encourage us that we can still do good in this class even though we don't have much background prior this class","Again, with very little physics knowledge, [Removed] acknowledged that this was very new for us. She has helped with introductory math topics too and have let us provide feedback for her.","I had never taken physics before this course, so the teacher has made me and others feel very reassured. She has wanted to know our prior knowledge so she can adapt her teaching ways. Also, after us having Test 1 she has said countless times not to worry and that we have lots of other assignments to help aid our grade.","In the beginning, the professor expressed that we should be able to glean some knowledge from this course and be able to do well even if we haven't had a strong math background in years! It was very assuring to know that the professor understood where we were coming from. ;)","She has always asked if there is anything she is assuming to be known. If there is something someone doesn't understand, the professor always takes her time to explain. Besides, she offers plenty if opportunities to visit her and ask questions privately.","Sometime before one of our recent tests she reminded us that our differing knowledge does not mean we can't grasp the material. We were preparing for the test.","[Removed] and after exams / exam preperation she tells us that everyone can suceed in this course, if you put forth the effort and want to succeed in the course","[Removed] specifically stated how the class is a pass or fail class based on attendance. He didn't want to burden the students class workload with his own curriculum.","Professor and TA are persistent that grades are not determined by your previous grades or knowledge. They regularly remind us of this by providing us slide shows on how to become a better student to succeed and why one shouldn't be deterred from wanting success because of prior instances.","He has stated that even though some of the material looks hard that we shouldn't worry because he's going to teach us and it isn't as hard as it looks.","It was in the beginning of the year within the first two weeks of school. She explained how it was a pass or fail class and she is certain that no one would fail. She told us how there aren't quizzes or grades and youdont need to know about study habits or academic classes and how to pick schedules before you came in because that is what you learn in her class."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

However, she always emphasizes that how familiar with the topic doesn't determine our ability to determine the material.","Dr. [Removed] often reminds us that we will have opportunities to improve our grades / skills even if we performed poorly on a previous quiz or test.","My instructor is always positive and reassuring us that we are capable of learning and applying course concepts","The instructor of this course said it right at the beginning when the syllabus was being introduced. However, this did not persist as time passed.","I personally have only ever taken 10th grade chemistry, so my prior knowledge was basic chemistry NOT at the college level. With hard work, I have been able to do well in this course.","Day after the test the instructor stated that the grades were good and the test grade doesn't define how you will do in the class.","Within the first week or two of school, Dr. [Removed] mentioned how it does not matter if you have a prior knowledge of chemistry to be able to succeed in the class. She made it clear that as long as we pay attention, that we have to ability to do well.","A lot of the information we have covered so far we talked about in high school on a more basic level. Just because you did not succeed when learning the material then, you still have an opportunity to gain mastery now.","Our professor mentions that whatever our experience was in terms of chemistry, especially if it was bad, does not determine how this course will go. She is encouraging for sure.","I do not remember a specific moment.","Past knowledge is very helpful because it allows you to improve within the course. If you do not have much past knowledge it won't affect your future because you can always gain more knowledge.","In the first few weeks of the course, Dr. [Removed] would say that we may not do well in the beginning but once we begin learning and understanding more we will do better. She would say that what we know now is not a measure of how we will do in the rest of the class.","The professor is always reassuring us that its okay not to get it on the first try, and that we should keep studying and using our resources.","when : this week \n\n what : she mentioned how some students may have seen [Removed] models and hybridization in their high school career and how she will go over it again to ensure that every student is able to understand what those concepts mean.","It was at the beginning of the semester. She said as long as we do the learning modules and pay attention in class we can succeed.","[Removed]","No, she didn't talk about this one.","My professor consistently talks about how students are only expected to study the material she has provided. She vocalizes that students who may have a past in chemistry or have been more academically successful than other students do not have an edge over others.","After the last exam she made sure to let us know that our performance on the exam does not reflect our future potential.","In class, when we are learning new concepts in class, that requires past knowledge, if a student may not know something, she always point out different videos or resources that could help us, and she always ensures that not knowing does not mean we will fail the class.","This was after an exam and she refers to how some of the material is nice to know prior, but even students who haven't taken chemistry can succeed in her course. This helps reassure students who haven't taken the course or haven't remembered the material they learned in high school.","n / a","I think she has mentioned how you did not have to take a chemistry class in the past to be able to be successful in class. This happened at the beginning of the class.","When we entered our final unit she said that even if we did not take chemistry in high school we can still succeed.","Our professor reassures us that our past knowledge or current knowledge does not pre - determine how we will do in the future, that it is up to the students to take action in what they want to do.","Yes, told us we always have potential to do better on the next exams","Our instructor for this course has discussed how we have the resources to learn information that we may not have had prior knowledge of. She has provided us with ways to find all of the background information needed to build on our knowledge.","She had mentioned last week that we may not have had much of emphasis on thermodynamics in high school, but that we are capable of learning the new unit without prior knowledge. \n","This course happens twice a week and there s a lecture. The instructor every week teaches pretty well.","I can't remember a specific moment.","The instructor would tell us that even if we did not understand chemistry in high school there is better understanding in college. That we can still learn and grow.","talking about past tests we have taken and ways we can grow and retake those tests","I don't remember her saying this, but she is always is very motivating and wanting her student to better and get better at the material.","Taking high school chemistry is helpful for this class but also the summer course work. She also tells us this constantly and at least one a month.","Often reassures me and other students in lecture that there are multiple ways to reach the same goal. Whether that's reaching out to different resources or asking for more help.","We had lecture on Monday afternoon, which was the next class day after a unit exam. She was proud of how we had performed on the exam, but understood that many of the students were still struggling to make A's on the exams. She wanted everyone to know that we have taken the material before in high school and we have some of the information still imbedded in our brains. She understands that not everyone did well in chemistry in high school, but now we have over 100 classmates to work with plus, the other chemistry students in the other classes and so many TA's that can help us. There is always room for improvement.","She said that you do not need to have taken AP chemistry in high school to do well in the course. She says this somewhat frequently","I can't remember a specific moment.","She gives a chance to retest and replace 2 of our exams. I think this is a way of relieving some of the stress on us and showing that even if we didn't do well, we can show our understanding of the material later.","You can redo two of the tests so you don't have to be stressed about the class and don't have to keep looking back at the failures.","During class or prior to tests, she repetitively says that test review, quizzes, and continuously provides us with all the material for success in her class.","When my professor said this, she let the class know that even if we are struggling now, as long as we are using our resources and studying the concepts and material, we should be able to pass the course. If something doesn't go in our favor, Dr. [Removed] has clarified that we will have multiple opportunities to help our grades increase.","Again, Professor [Removed] knows chemistry isn't for everyone and goes in depth to topics people have already learned to make sure everyone understands.","She gave us a positive talk during a lecture one day. She encouraged us that our future is not based upon one bad test grade and that we are capable of what we set our minds to.","I don't have an example of when the instructor did this","The professor mentions a few times throughout lectures about certain topics we may recognize or understand from high school.","When coming into this class, chemistry, we jumped right into topics that they expected us to know, but the truth is, we last reviewed this material quite some time ago. But it does not describe the future potential of the student because it is never too late to review back on these topics and learn them again.","I can not remember a time where this happened","Just stated during class after the test that it's ok if we didn't do so well on the exam, and that there will be other places to make it up, thus improving our future grades.","Today during lecture, the instructor was briefly going over an alternative route some students may take if they are falling behind in class where they could plan on taking the course next semester and use this semester as extra prep time if they don't think they will be succeeding based on their current understanding of the concepts covered thus far. I believe she mentioned that it is entirely possible and perfectly fine if some students required this route.","She always brings up how we learned this in the past and that it's gon na be okay.","On topics that are coming up, they said \" If you have taken [Removed] in the past you will have seen this before, if not don't worry you'll get it too. \"","Some have take previous chem classes","The instructor knows that we all took basic chemistry in high school, so she expects us to know basic concepts. However, knowing beyond those basic concepts is not important to doing well with the material she teaches.","Especially with Unit 2 it is mostly topics from high school that are exploring more, with ionic a covalent bonds and [Removed] dot structures.","Dr. [Removed] has emphasizes how many of us mayhave learned this material prior to the class, either through highschool or other programs, but has stated that this prior knowledge is not explicitly required. Particularly, she was offered help to anyone that finds themselves struggling without prior knowledge","Past students have told me the course is simple. Those students weren't that good at chemistry either","I'm not sure exactly of this, but she does always encourage us to keep working and to not give up.","When going over the exam, Dr. [Removed] talked about how even if we didn't do well on the test, we learned something and will have a better idea on how to tackle the test next time. She did well on showing us that we learned something from the experience.","She is very nice and encouraging to her students.   She lets us know that we are human and we can make mistakes but that doesn't define us and that as long as we can work hard.","She tried her best to explain things in terms that could be understood regardless of background. Regardless, she would refer to high school topics as a way to start.","The instructor stated on the first day that you didn't need to be in any previous chemistry courses to take this class. She states that everyone is starting on the same base line and their past chemistry knowledge does not reflect how they will achieve in this class.","She makes sure to go over the tests with us. She also reassured us by providing many resources to study.","Dr. [Removed] informs us that our grade reflects the work that we put in. She gives us plenty of learning material for us to practice outside of class which is very helpful.","She s talks about how we are doing well on quizzes and tests and that, even if some people did bad, they can improve and do better","She does this at the start of each unit to explain we can put in the effort to do well on each topic.","She mentioned about the difference if someone took AP versus atsudent who didn't and how we can still succeed.","During the first two weeks of classes this semester Dr. [Removed] made sure to tell us that we all have the potential to succeed. Dr. [Removed] told us that we could do anything if we tried and worked for it and that we were all capable of doing great it her class.","Stated things that were learned in high school but still re taught them","My teacher tells us how we can take this course even if we have not taken a chemistry class in a long time. She tells us we can still get a good grade if we put the work in.","Dr. [Removed] is very encouraging. While her teaching style is not the easiest for me to grasp, she seems kind and often encourages the class.","Professor [Removed] constantly reassures us all that we all worked hard to get where we are in [Removed] [Removed] and that no matter our past experiences, we will succeed in her class if we put in the work. Professor [Removed] makes sure to give us confidence that we will succeed in her class.","She always has encouraged us to take a break and make sure not to make us stress over content in class. She never tells us we can't do it because of our past experiences.","I remember her telling us this on the first day of class","Before the course began, Dr. [Removed] explained that every high school student was taught chemistry at different levels and that this course was a new start. She wanted all of us to feel prepared despite our past knowledge. She was encouraging us that even if we had no great understanding of chemistry ( yet ) that does not define or set in stone our success in her course and that we could do well despite our past knowledge.","I actually did not mean to click that. She did not say or do this.","After our first mid - term exam, I remember vividly our instructor congratulating us on our performance on the test. They stated that even if you didn't achieve the score you desired, you have so much potential to build off of from this point forward.","She likes to remind us that we can succeed and that our success is in our own hands. She posts out that we may struggle but we can pull through and make our goals possible in the end.","I m not able to recall the specifics","I don't remember her saying this but it doesn't mean she doesn't think the same for all the students about this.","this occurs typically at the start of a unit","When going over previous tests she tells students they still have opportunities to do well in the course even if they've done bad on one exam","At the start of the year she mentioned this. It has been accurate so far.","Our professor once said that there is always room and time for change, and that everyone is capable of earning an A in her class.","she gives feedback and makes it easy to learn.","In the course, the instructor addressed students' concerns about struggling with new material by emphasizing that difficulties are a normal part of learning. This typically occurred before major assessments, when the instructor would say, “ Remember, where you are right now reflects your past experiences, not your future abilities. Everyone starts somewhere, and what matters is the progress you make from here. ”","After and before tests she will mention how we will do great and how it doesn't define who we are.","I truly do not remember this happening in my recent memory. It sounds like it has though.","She always reminds us after exam scores come out that previous grades will not determine what we make on the next exam. She reminds us that we can make up exams for the final at the end of the semester.","After tests, she talks about her thoughts on what people need to improve upon, but never states it is something we can not recover from. She tells us that if we want to, we can always retake the bad tests at the end of the semester","At the beginning of the course as we were learning about chemistry basics, she stated that our past knowledge or grade in chemistry for high school does not dictate our future success. I found this very motivating as I was very worried for college chemistry as I got a [Removed] in high school pre - Ap chemistry. It motivated me and reduced my anxiety, now I have a 100 in the course","She mentions this after tests are over to celebrate that we finished it. She's done this for every test so far.","The instructor stated that receiving bad grades on exams are just a wake up call to study for future tests and to not dwell. There is a positive environment created.","During the first day of class, Dr. [Removed] introduced healthy mindsets for learning. She showed a small video on the subject.","He seems like he'd think that no matter what you know previously it doesn't change your future potential.","Instructor always helps and provides answers to questions if students have questions. Do not rely on students to have past knowledge, always supportive and willing to teach.","Some of the concepts discussed in the lab align with topics that students may have previously learned. However, the instructor has said that her and the TAs are there to guide students through all of the information that will be taught in lab in the future.","I can not think of a specific moment but our TA is constantly encouraging us to grow and draw on past experiences. We are able to take our past experience, reflect on it, and better ourselves.","Even though the pre - labs are made to expand on past material learned from previous courses, every lab has been handled in a way that makes every student seem on a square one level. It has made it easy to learn new material regardless of what we already know, and for us to expand our future potential.","Talked about how course is an introductory for a reason, therefore it is a safe learning space for everyone no matter their current knowledge.","Intro lab so you build background experience from here","We can be always be smarter and learn more from classes and people","[Removed] emphasizes that it's okay if you don't know certain things, but that we can fill in the gaps in our knowledge by learning","She said that no one in the class is a microbiologist, so it's okay that we don't know everything. She said that we are all learning together. \n","She is extremely picky on grading to the point where I am worried about missing things for the grade book rather than focusing on what is going on in class","We are constantly given opportunities and resources to catch up on schoolwork.","This course has allowed me to feel more confident in my ability to do scientific research. Gaining hands on experience has been very insightful and exciting. My professors and TAs have done nothing but guide and support me in both times of need and certainty.","she makes it known that we are able to learn anything and are able to ask questions whenever we want.","beginning of the semester","He mentions how we learn from our past experiences and get better in the lab.","Our teacher goes over concepts that we learned in AP bio in high school. This helps us to review and make sure that we have a good understanding of the basics.","Explains everything in detail regardless of how advanced / knowledgable students are so that everyone may follow along and does not discriminate with questions.","At the start of the year, Professor [Removed] said that all students have different starting points, based on how much knowledge they retained from [Removed] in high school. She made it very clear that even though we would all have to study varying amounts to stand at an equal level, she emphasized that everyone could succeed in her class and that she would put in effort to help everyone who needed it.","Dr [Removed] lets us know that we are always learning and can always improve","There are a few things expected to be known beforehand since it is an advanced class, but it is not too hard","The first day of class was dedicated to growth mindset and going over research that implicated that one's potential wasn't predetermined. She employed copious [Removed] [Removed] and anecdotes from her TA to corroborate the reality of growth mindset.","Dr. [Removed] always emphasizes that it is okay to make mistakes and if we are making mistakes, then that means that we are truly learning. She ensures that everyone feels comfortable and even says to \" take it one day at a time \" at the end of all of her emails, which makes me feel more motivated.","At the beginning of the course she mentioned how lots of genetics is about application and not memorization. She emphasizes the need for practicing her problems, instead of having past knowledge.","I would like to go back and change my answer on this one because I can't think of a specific moment where she talked about our potential. But I do know for a fact that she has many time talked about how everyone comes from different backgrounds and knowledge and that you can find success in the class.","She often repeats content that we already learned to make sure that we understand what we're learning and brings in some content that we may have to know for in the future.","Mainly after our first and second exams, she reflected on the test grades. She encouraging students to keep trying and attend office hours.","Dr. [Removed] has talked about how we all have a chance to succeed in this course as long as we put in adequate effort and apply our knowledge. This goes for all students regardless of background.","Dr. [Removed] always emphasizes that we all have the potential and the power within us to improve ourselves, whether it's academically or personally.","always makes sure that the students are meant to be in the class and provides strategies to ensure that we can be successful regardless.","This happens often as Dr. [Removed] emphasizes how our potential is determined by our growth mindset and the work we do. She constantly reminds us that our past does not shape our future and we can still determine our future.","Repeatedly emphasizes this point through online discourse on [Removed] and in class after tests. The most recent example would be after the last exam in class and right before the exam in a [Removed] announcement.","There have been multiple instances during class where the professor talks about how learning in academia is not the same for everybody, and how it's okay to make mistakes. She states that it's all about having a growth mindset.","Explains how our current knowledge about this class is from previous courses we may have taken and regardless of how we did in the courses we still will continue learning","She sent out an announcement after releasing the first exam grade saying that students can still improve as long as we are refining our way of studying and don't give up. In her announcement, she had a list of actions students can take to hopefully aid their studying plan for the next exam.","She gives us study strategies and reminds us to have a growth mindset.","This was at the beginning of the semester and the professor discussed how to set your mindset to grow during the course. She described how wherever we were in terms of prior knowledge coming into the class, with the proper mindset, we could grow through the course in our knowledge and handle the challenges that come in the way.","Dr. [Removed] has always brought up how we should develop and keep a growth mindset in mind.   She has stated that having a growth mindset, which is a mindset in which we are able to grow and develop our intelligence or knowledge and skills rather than remaining stagnant in these characteristics, is helpful especially in this course rather than having a fixed mindset, which could hinder our ability to grow and learn. She mentioned this recently in one of our lectures where we did a reflection, and she also emphasized this in the first few lectures of the course as she believed that it is an important concept to be familiar with in order to motivate us to learn and not be brought down by tough times.","This was discussed during the beginning of the semester when we set goals as a class.","Before and after exams, she states that your grade does not define who are. It's how we learn from our experiences that define us.","She makes sure that we have enough knowledge necessary to succeed in this class. Any reason I am not getting a 100 is because I personally did not put enough effort in the class. I am set up to get an A in the course, but I could have definitely allotted more time to commit to this course and achieved a 100 with the resources Dr. [Removed] provides.","Dr. [Removed] states that our knowledge has come from high school courses, our intro bio courses, and other factors. She tells us that we have new information now and to work on developing fresh skills necessary for this class.","She always creates a positive environment where we can excel in and does give comes like you should of learned this in intro to bio, but makes sure we can always improve no matter what we might have had in the past","Talk about how this connects to concepts in bio lab","After exams, Dr. [Removed] makes sure that we understand that poor performance can be overcome and does not reflect future potential.","Dr. [Removed] is constantly spreading positive messages of encouragement that center personal growth, and helps provide resources for constant improvement and learning. After every exam, Dr. [Removed] praises students for their hard work and reminds them that an exam is not always representative of knowledge or self worth and that there is always opportunity for improvement.","Dr. [Removed] always encourages her students by telling us that we can master the material no matter what our background may be. She always tells us certain past experiences that she has had and how they have shaped her to where she is at now.","Having a diverse class is great","Early on in the beginning of the semester when the class was getting to know Dr. [Removed], he told us that every student in the class has the opportunity to get an A in the course and that despite our previous experiences with math and physics, that we all have the capability to succeed.   He has given us an assignment as well on our growth mindset and asked us to think about how a student can succeed in the course.","In the first week of class, we all raised our hands when asked when the last time we took a math course was. Despite all of us having different answers, Dr. [Removed] ensured us that this does not reflect the potential we have to succeed in this course.","I think I selected falsely. Dr [Removed] does not do this and explicitly has said numerous times how you can continue to learn and get better if you apply yourself. He does mention how there is some past knowledge that you come in with but that doesn't shape whether you do well in the class or not.","Our professor asked us what our backgrounds in physics were on the first day of class, and seemed intrigued by everyone's experiences no matter what level they were at. He builds up from smaller topics, reinforcing the idea that what we learn today is more important than our various past experiences.","When discussing angular movements, we discovered that we would need to use the quadratic formula. Rather than wasting class time discussing it, Dr. [Removed] discussed how this is a concept that we are very familiar with from past courses in college or high school.","He stated at the beginning of the semester that while we may have previous knowledge, we are learning new / unfamiliar content for everyone, so it does not reflect how well you do in this class.","In the course, the instructor led a discussion encouraging us to connect what we already knew with new concepts we were learning. This took place early in the term, and the instructor said, “ Our past experiences shape what we know now, but they don't limit what we can achieve. ” The activity helped us see our knowledge as a foundation, inspiring us to approach future learning with an open mind.","If I'm interpreting it correctly, he tells us we can still learn even if we have not learned physics before. For example, when most people did badly on the last exam he reminded us we can learn from the experience.","At the beginning of the year, he ensured that students with varying levels of previous physics experience could succeed. “ Anyone can learn physics ”","In our course, whenever we perform poorly on a midterm, the instructor takes the time to remind us that our current knowledge does not determine our future potential. His supportive approach reassures us that we can learn from our mistakes and encourages a growth mindset. Such encouragement could be beneficial in other courses, as it helps students focus on their potential rather than their past performance.","Gave a speech after the exam","Professor discussed this topic after first exam. Professor stated during lecture that the performance on the first test is not a determinator of how well you will do. He stated that we have full capability to do well.","Our first test was rough ( [Removed] ) class average. Dr. [Removed] played this motivational video and said something along the lines of, progress never happens if you don't constantly keep momentum going.","Currently, we are using a lot of algebra to solve our equations, so he often refers back to past material we've learned and emphasizes how everything is built off of it. It occurs on occasion but mostly when we are applying new equations that seem intimidating. He also is always talking about how we can come for help if we are struggling in the moment with the current material which will help in the future when we begin to build off of that material.","Dr. [Removed] mentions all the time that the teaching team is available to help and everybody has the potential to do well in this course regardless of having any previous physics background.","My professor has talked about how we live in a world that is governed by physics. Every action we do, such as typing on this survey, is an act of physics. He mentions this almost every class day.","In this course, the instructor has described how our outcomes are in our own control, what resources are at our disposal, and how it is not logical to internalize poor performance. In this way, Dr. [Removed] has encouraged students to work on problems without assuming future failure form past mistakes.","In the beginning of the semester, the professor had mention that even if we don't recall previous information from high school, we will still be okay because we will be learning it during class. This was very helpful because it took off the pressure to remember.","On the first day of class he explained that if you take time outside of class to study and work on the homework you will be good for the class","He was lecturing during the first week and he said that anyone can learn physics.","He says this consistently during class.","Mostly was just thinking of him being very understanding and certain that people can succeed in this class if they put in the work.","Our professor often talks about a fixed vs. growth mindset and how a growth mindset is crucial for allowing ourselves to overcome mistakes and improve over time. He has us write reflections to allow us to think about our current mindsets in the class, which are largely a result of our own experiences and knowledge, and how we can change our mindset to that of one that can grow and improve.","After every exam he share encouraging words despite the average and lets us know our grades don't completely define our future.","i just know that if the class is feeling down after an exam or anything dr [Removed] would use encouraging words to help motivate and uplift the students","After the below average test scores. He emohasized this is not an accurate reflection of us. He encouraged us to learn. He even offered retakes","Dr. [Removed] showed a graph depicting a learning curve, and described how we must persevere to see the benefits our our hard work reflect in our performance. In this process, he explained that it doesn't matter what our past experienced on exams are, there is always room for improvement.","I can't think","His lecture is different with other biology class that I took at high school because he always highlight the importance of understanding not memorizing. While taking his course, I realized that the past knowledge and memorization don't significantly affect my academic performance. I should focus on more understanding the concept by using general sense.","Sata showed us the distribution of scores after our first test, and he said that it's ok if we didn't do really well since everyone has a different background in [Removed]. He told us to complete the assignment analyzing the questions we missed to do better on the next test.","He explains how what you did in high school does not matter, nor the grades you are currently getting matter. He explains how you are here to learn, not to compete.","After the first exam, Dr sata reassured the class that even if you got a bad grade in the class, you can still get your grade up.","Dr. [Removed] said that anyone can succeed in his course with effort. He also said that people with past experience are not a particular advantage to those who have not taken those advanced courses before.","During lecture, our instructor told us that we can all do well on the exam but we have to put in the work ourselves with the right strategies","In the course, the instructor said, “ Your current understanding comes from past experiences but doesn't limit your future potential. ” This happened during a challenging lesson on [Removed] structures, where the instructor encouraged us to reflect on how much we had already learned and could continue to grow.","Dr. [Removed] is really good at explaining new concepts to us like we have never heard it before. He also gives us all the tools to succeed such as his past lecture videos.","Our professor shows us we all have the same opportunity to learn in his class","it is a hard class and the professor acknowledged that in the beginning and has continued to do so since. after the first test he emphasized that if we did bad we can do better on future tests and he encouraged us to go to his office hours and speak to him about what we can do to study and learn the material better. He was very supportive and said we could still do well in the class to just keep trying.","At the very start of the course, the first day of school, Dr. [Removed] mentioned that the there was not difference between students that had taken AP biology in high school and the ones that did not. There was not an impact on grades or performance on the class.","When learning a difficult concept earlier in the semester, the instructor emphasized that this was difficult and students tend to struggle. However, she assured that there was plenty of opportunity to learn and that it would come more naturally with time.","just mentioned what experience you need with code when starting the class","The instructor emphasized that you don't need prior coding knowledge to succeed in this course. She said, \" making mistakes in coding is part of the learning process. \"","She talked about it","This past week, the professor took a poll on how people were feeling about grasping concepts in class and she assured student who felt they were struggling that it was normal to have trouble in the beginning and with more practice, a greater grasp on the concepts can be achieved.","Mentioned in syllabus","When people are not happy with their grade she will remind us to be happy","Dr. [Removed] first asked how familiar / comfortable the students felt with R during class. After reviewing the results, she explained that students who find using R difficult should not be discouraged and should remind themselves that they have only been coding in R for three weeks. She also assured them that even with 10 years of experience, she still needs to look things up occasionally.","Can not remember","She always encourages us to look at the bigger picture.","Last time we had to take a survey she described this exact thing. She also guaranteed that our work in this class would be helpful for our future and that she was building our skills.","Dr. [Removed] mentions that it's okay to struggle on a weekly basis based on instapolls and explains that they should seek help through drop in hours if they need help or want to improve.","She has instapolls asking how we feel about coding and then tells us we have already learned a lot and encourages us","The people in the class come from very different levels and backgrounds. This class is made to be very accessible to people of all skill levels to be able to learn.","\n I thinks she emphasizes this but I don't remember well.","She made sure to start from a level where we could all understand.","has not happened yet ( too early in course )","We were all in lecture early in the semester and she said something along the lines of we're going to start simple so that everyone's on the same page. She also frequently goes into detail on simple topics so that everyone can understand them.","The instructor goes over the course in a way that everyone can understand and tries to simplify the statistics concepts each lecture.","I can't remember a specific example","Dr. [Removed] definitely mentioned this when opening her course and share this level of encouraging thought after quizzes.","I remember during our introduction to the class Professor [Removed] made sure to express to all of us that we belong here. It's kind of reassuring to know that she believed we were at [Removed] and in her class for a reason, and not to let the doubt get to us.","Sometimes, the lecture is portraying   a real life experience that some may not have experienced. However, the content is relatively understandable.","Beginning of course lecture","I do not remember well enough to answer this question.","In the first few lectures, Dr [Removed] gave out a survey to the students enrolled in the course. With this survey, Dr [Removed] saw that many students were not necessarily interested in a future in ecology. Dr [Removed] then described how those not interested may not have as much prior knowledge as others but that does not mean they will struggle or will be worse than others in the course","begining of the semester she said we can easily suceed in this class if we work hard","She said we could all succeed if we want to","She mentioned a lot at the beginning of the course her expectations that we had taken so many different courses that were not even pre - requisites. For example, she thought we all had taken evolution already when that is not the case. So she expects students to have knowledge from their past.","Nothing particular happened she just makes you feel like we are all taking the same class and makes us talk with our peers so it doesn't really feel like one person is separated from the other","we can always improve, which she mentions at the end of every test","she just stated that she believes in us and that we can reach our goals.","When we discuss certain topics, sometimes she may call back to genetics or evolution courses to provide some further understanding. She recognizes that not everybody has taken those courses yet, so she offers plenty of opportunity to fill the knowledge gaps to ensure everybody is on the same page.","At times the instructor will mention how past learning strategies may be outdated and could be better for preparing one for an exam","Touching on our past in Intro [Removed] and helping us with excel skills we may have not learned in past classes","Talks to us constantly about her pathway here and how she used to not have a growth mindset \n","She has a very big growth mindset","Yes she talks about personal experiences and reassures us that test don't determine how smart you are which is why she does retake opportunities.","She has stated that she has failed many times before present day. Her failing in the past only helped her future self learn more. Her prior knowledge and experiences of failure only led her to have better success.","She would always say how she wansnt the most smart and still could learn physics, Very inclusive.","The professor would relate the students' current challenges with their past academic challenges and reiterate that the ability to learn, regardless of speed and current strengths and weaknesses, is the major determining factor in whether a student will succeed.","Prof [Removed] talked about how she struggled with physics, struggled with being the only female amongst male colleagues and talked about crying and losing faith in herself and saying sometimes it takes her a slower time to learn -- but it all worked out in the end. She is so encouraging and just an amazing person.","today my professor told us about her own experience teaching and how her perspective changed when she realized that showing humanity in teaching helped students learn","When : every class \n What : The Professor encourages us to try our best, and to give ourselves a chance to improve and learn from our past mistakes.","She explained how she wasn't really confident in her own skills as a person whenever she was starting in college because \" look at all the people above me \" kind of attitude towards the people she looked up to that knew so much about physics. However, she found that they're just as human as everyone else and don't have a natural inclination to physics, but just applied themselves to the work over a long period of time.","The instructor reminds us in class during quizzes or lecture that it is okay to be wrong because our current knowledge does not reflect our potential, and we all have potential to learn more. This happens often, maybe once every week or two.","Professor always tells us our future is never in jeopardy if we are struggling currently. She implies that past experiences have gotten us to where we are and as long as we keep working we can do anything, especially doing well in the course too.","Dr. [Removed] always reminds us that to be successful in physics, you must always keep practicing and sharpen your physics problem - solving skills. This is beneficial because it is a philosophy to remember in this class and outside of class.","She always gives up pep talks about having a growth mindset and shares personal stories of her own struggles in the field to share us how academic growth is possible.","Professor [Removed] reguarly encourages us to not give up and to always look up. She tells us stories about her past and how people would look down on her for being a women in physics or how she failed a test once. She lets us know that a failed grade does not define us and we can always go up from here.","We had an exam and Dr. [Removed] emphasized that the exam is a learning experience that can help us in the future regardless of how we did","Always makes a point that our previous exam grades or whatnot isn't indicative of what we can achieve in the future.","The professor explained how everyone comes from different backgrounds, which doesn't make them any less knowledgeable. Also, the professor says, if you have seen this, then that's good, if not that is okay as well.","Professor [Removed] [Removed] explained that knowledge is accumulated through trial and error. He followed this up by noting his own struggles as a college student in a physics class.","Can't remember","He always states what we need to know from physics 1 concepts if they are relevant to anything we're learning for this class. Additionally, he mentioned an anecdote about how he got a low score on his first exam and has overcome that since.","can not remember","He taught very well and wrote down notes","I'm not sure","Doesn't really go much in detail about this, it's just the vibe and experience being a first - time physics [Removed] student.","The instructor after exams will talked about how in his past he did bad on his tests but still managed to do great in the future and encouraged us to not be let down by bad grades now.","A week ago after the exam, our instructor commended us on our scores and told us if we did bad on it, that it was okay. Then he shared his own personal story on how he did not do so well on his first exam in college and was encouraging us that although our past will not define us, the future is where we can fix our mistakes and reach our potential.","Dr. [Removed], during lecture, told us that our exam grades do not define us as students or human beings. He then told us that whatever we got was not a reflection of our character or how well we know the material, but rather a diagnostic of what he wants us to know about the material.","He was simply explaining to the class on the first day that anyone can succeed in his course. \" Anyone can achieve the desired letter grade by using the resources provided and going to office hours. \"","Our professor quoted the latter parts of this quote word for word after an exam.","After the first exam, he said that the grade received were not fully representative of our knowledge and that if people applied themselves more to the material, they could understand it better in the future.","He described that just because we all did not have the same prior knowledge like certain AP courses that did not mean we would fail.","Whenever I asked a question during the discussion sessions, I made it clear that I had never taken physics before. However, they reassured me that it wasn't an issue and patiently explained both the problem and the solution.","One time, the instructor shared a personal story about how he didn't perform well on his first college exam but eventually developed better study strategies over time. He emphasized that our current knowledge reflects past experiences but doesn't determine our future potential. Afterward, he reminded us that we, too, can improve by learning from mistakes and offered the opportunity to redo exams for half credit on wrong answers, reinforcing that growth is always possible with effort and reflection.","We get to be able to work our errors on exams for half points back which supports that our current knowledge isn't a true representation of our potential. Additionally, we get consistent support to work through problems to prepare our knowledge for exams.","If we don't like our scores on our midterms we can always try again and that one bad score isn't a reflection of our ability.","Dr. [Removed] emphasizes that exams are \" imperfect snapshots \" of your current learning, and don't determine your potential. He also emphasizes that hard work and effective problem solving strategies are necessary to achieve the course outcomes you desire.","Dr. [Removed] always tells us that we can thrive in the class, and how we can still learn more. She is so sweet and so encouraging.","When Professor [Removed] was introducing the class, I felt like she explained thoroughly that success in this course and at [Removed] as a whole is possible because of how far we've already come to get to this point. Her tone has always been encouraging.","She always makes sure that we know that we can go to her if we don't understand something ( and that she has cookies during office hours if we'd like ). She makes a point to tell us that we're doing well or that she will do her best to help us understand from a different perspective if we don't understand.","She is very positive with her words and constantly reassures that if things aren't making sense it is completely okay to ask questions, in fact she encourages this. Students obviously appreciate this reassurance and it makes the classroom environment less stressful.","She has more than once made us remember our value as students by stating that it is hard to get into [Removed]. She started saying this around mid way through the semester.","As we prepped for our most recent quiz, she highlighted why we have various assignments that help maintain our grades. She wants us to know that we have the ability to learn the content and not focus so much on the grade.","She said that anyone can succeed in this class regardless of how they do on exams. There is always room to do well.","She applauds us for our test grades even though they might not meet our own expectations. She always states there's no shame in asking questions and how her and her team are hear to support us through this course.","At the beginning of lecture, the lecture mentioned that all students were at [Removed] [Removed] because they earned their spot. Because their past knowledge enabled them to achieve a spot at this university, the instructor motivated students that they were capable of achieving their better self.","In the course we were going over some difficult material regarding [Removed] and she said to remember that physics is hard, and that we are at a univerilsty level physics class at [Removed] and that it is hard and she does not expect this to be easy.","Can't remember","She constantly emphasizes how important it is for students to start the homeworks for this class early. She doesn't say this in a condescending manner like a lot of my past professors. You can tell she says this because she wants the students to succeed.","She said this during class once that she saw we were confused and wanted to remind us that this was a university level class but that we were all able to do it no matter our background we just needed the right methods","He stated that he got a D in his intro physics course. He then stated that he made it as a professor in physics eventually.","Dr. [Removed] makes it very clear that he wants to help us learn physics. It doesn't matter if you have prior or no prior experience. If you put in the work, you can do well.","Similar to my response to the first question, Dr. [Removed] always encouraging us to take our failures and learn from them. Constantly reminding us that no one is incapable of learning physics.","Dr. [Removed] has discusses his past experiences with depression and a very low GPA, and how he was able to become a successful professors despite that.   This story shows me and other students that past experiences don't reflect future potential.","It was during a lecture before our first exam where he made sure to let us know that if we were struggling we should go to him and that if we were bad at physics or calculus in the past that doesn't dictate how well we do in the course \n","I believe that a students past experiences will affect the way they reflect during classes.","No one truly knows where life is gon na take them. She helped us go to understand that your career will have a lot of ups and downs.","She talked about how all learning and experience is important for jobs","She advises us to find the right learning strategies for ourselves.","In the first few days of class the professor asked us of our personal experience with physics to which a lot of people responded with little or no experience. He then tailored the next few days to that and went a bit slower.","He explicitly said that students past experiences won't affect their ability to succeed in the course.","The first day of class we were told that all our past experience was useful to the course but was not needed to succeed. We were told as long as we kept an open mind and tried we could succeed even if we struggled with physics in the past.","In the beginning of the semester the professor stated that if we made it through physics I then we have the hardwork and skills to make it through [Removed] [Removed].","During lecture he would say how even if you felt you don't know a concept, you can still do well in the class if you fix your study strategies. He said that our future potential isn't based on how bad you did on a test.","I believe this was during syllabus week. The instructor told us that we can improve out understanding in physics - we will not have to be bad at physics all our lives.","I remember the instructor shared a letter from an earlier student who had never learned physics before taking this course and finally succeeded. She wants to show us that past experiences will not limit our future potential.","I recall Dr. [Removed] making a point during lecture that if some people in the course seem to find the material more tractable, that it is often due to them having a more thorough background knowledge of it and greater opportunities for physics education prior to [Removed]. I feel this is very important for encouraging people who don't feel confident in their ability to improve at physics or resign themselves as \" not a physics person \".","The professor has given her students excerpt from past students. The typically happens at the beginning of each class. This allows the students to see that there is room for improvement regardless of prior experience or knowledge","For every very single lecture, Dr. [Removed] has within her slides a letter written from previous students in her class. They've been written from as early as last semester. Within these letters, the students explain their previous experiences and backgrounds relative to physics ( some come from no background with physics while some took advanced physics courses in high school ) and explain how they were successful in Dr. [Removed] course. I found these extremely insightful because within all of these letters you can find a pattern as to how these students were very successful. \n\n","She gives a lot of makeup chances like the midterm can replaces your unit quiz and if you score higher on the final than you did in the class the final test grade replaces your overall grade.","After each test, the professor summarizes the errors and encourages the students to keep trying. At the same time, I occasionally encourage students based on my own experience or the experience of previous students.","Dr. [Removed] typically presents excerpts from students who have taken her class previously or she will talk about her own experiences in physics and how she also struggled. She reminds us that we are all capable and failing doesn't really define us or how we will perform in the future","States in the syllabus that she wants us to succeed in the class and also states in class that a lot of us probably haven't seen this material in years and that's okay","Because this is an intro class, many students have not taken physics before. [Removed] has made sure to tell us that we do not need prior knowledge.","I believe Dr. [Removed] has mentioned on a couple of occasions how even if the class is somewhat introductory, it is ok if it is complicated for some students because their majors can not be connected to math, but everyone should be able to learn the content and get a good grade. \n","She understands that everyone has a different background with physics. Some people took it in high school, others didn't. She is able to recognize that that past experience does not regulate how well we can do in the class.","At the beginning of the semester, Dr. [Removed] made sure to iterate that anyone's struggles with introductory mechanics will not define their success in their continual learning of physics.","He lets us know that our past experiences do not have to affect our future. Just today he mentioned a story about how he was a really bad student at the beginning and then completely changed that and bettered his future.","The professor has emphasized that a specific grade or moment shouldn't have a huge impact on our learning in his class. He has a second try for every midterm to ease the stress and grade burden of each score."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Today, she stated that if we wanted to look ahead at the [Removed] Types to gauge our topics then that would be a helpful tool.","The professor mentions studying appropriately when speaking about the exam. Also, when we are learning new or complicated content, she always mentions resources available to improve our learning.","She tells us about the importance of preparation and studying.","I do not remember the specific moment","All of the information provided in resource hubs like practice test and notes","The week before our first exam was due, my professor advised the class to study the material in chunks and not the day before the exam, in order to perform better and not stress about our first exam and how well performed. She encourages her students to use as many resources as needed to study and prepare for exams and quizzes. I believe that the professor providing learning strategies to master the material is a clever suggestion to understand and succeed in the class since she is the one teaching us and knows better how the course works.","This was for preparing for exam 1 of the course. She was reviewing all the materials that are available for us to use and some suggestions for studying specific materials and spacing out our studying over the week leading up to the exam","She has a specific section in canvas that is all about exam preparation. She states that the information in there will fully set us up for success on our exams if we use it correctly.","Today, Professor [Removed] explained that the Learning modules are made to give us the best understanding, but if there is a better learning method, we are encouraged to take that route.","My professor makes it an important aspect to study correctly before tests. She does this to ensure our success rates with certain quizzes or tests. She usually speaks on these topics before major assignments are due.","Just today during class, we were talking about [Removed] dot structures. Dr. [Removed] encourages practicing drawing out lewis structures, even providing a list of compounds to draw. She made it very clear that drawing everything out is the best way to practice this skill.","In the beginning of the course, our professor told us in order to succeed we must study, do practice problems, and review in order to master the material.","She said something along the lines of this phrase before a quiz or test. She said this in the context of showing us all the materials and resources we have to prepare for exams.","Our learning modules have lots of information. These helps give us insight on the topics she teaches us the next lecture.","I believe she was telling us that, if we truly put in the time, it was possible to master the course and come out with an A. This was last week.","Instructor mentions that studying / using certain study methods is helpful, especially recently with Dr. [Removed]'s videos. We should watch these to assist with studying.","We are always reminded of all resources that are provided for us in canvas. We are often encouraged to do the practice problems provided in the lectures and in canvas.","The instructor would specifically say what strategies to use. There were other strategies but did not want   students getting confused.","The week before our last exam, Dr. [Removed] told students that they should use all the resources available to them to ensure that they didn't miss any important information.","I think it was after the first or second exam, she told us we had the learning modules from the chemistry readiness assessment and that we need to reflect on what worked and what didn't and tweak our strategies to do better next time.","Throughout each unit, the professor always encourages us to study weeks in advance for the exam as that will lead to a better outcome grade wise. She encourages to study the review notes, past quizzes and practice problems.","The instructor would assign us learning modules, allowing 3 attempts to make mistakes and learn the concept through the mistakes. She also would drop the 3 lowest quiz scores, along with allowing a person to take 2 replacements tests in case of them failing.","When she releases the study materials she is sure to let us know what is available to help us study and also tells us what to study especially if something is similar to the unit prior but slightly different. She makes sure that these things are announced at the beginning and during the lecture.","My instructor is open to all methods of learning.

This has helped me shape my study skills for this course.","Recently, the class average on the exam was very poor. He had an entire section in a recent lecture, talking about how to review to ensure that we understood the content.","Again, this is in the course outline so at the beginning of the semester. It was important to be able to remind students of the opportunities they have, not only within the course, and outside the course.","The instructor has not done this.","In the same reflection assignment, we were asked to reflect on strategies to increase our success. This also came after studying for the first test in which I tried to apply these strategies I discussed in my reflection.","Both before and after our first exam, Dr. [Removed] explained that this type of learning requires practice. He also explained that, if it is our learning style, we should get to know our classmates and study and do the homework together.","Dr [Removed] would often go through how to do problems on the board and would state that looking over these notes wouldn't be an efficient way to study.

This would happen after unit tests specifically, where some students could have done better.","Every week and within every exam review list he states that we have to find what study methods work best for us and continue based on that. He advocates against notecards because he believes that notecards only provide a surface level understanding of the course, and he encourages us to find study methods that involve real - world applications and genuine understanding. He would often state this in classes as well.","Dr. [Removed] often reminds us how we should be going about retaining information in his class. He acknowledges normal studying habits and reviewing notes but he most specifically emphasizes the importance of being able to apply the concepts and truly understand them.","He has mentioned this during class and even in the exam review lists / syllabus study methods that he recommends and believes works best.","Leading up to our first exam, he told us many scientifically proven methods of studying, and how flashcards, highlighting etc are only short term studying and do not help us learn as much.","He spoke about how cramming for the tests is not the way to go. To have the right strategies in this class include doing the In class activities and being involved in the TA sessions. He would mention this before beginning the lecture.","After our first exam, Dr. [Removed] went over our score distribution and suggested that students closely read his textbook and do all of the assignments he provides, even if they are not taken for a grade.

This was around the first couple of weeks of classes. I don't remember what the instructor said.","During the time of our first set of midterms, we had a lecture on tips and tricks to stay on track and succeed in our classes. We were asked what we were doing to study and shown a demonstration on different techniques and their results.

As we performed worse than the homework, she asked what strategies we were using. Therefore, she made a list with suggestions from students and stated that all of them work but we do not have to do all of them as we are all different. This is the moment that came to mind yet I am not sure if she stated that we need the right strategies, but I did notice she meant it that way as she constantly repeated that all of those strategies work but we could pick a few of them to study in our own way.","While I am pretty certain Dr. [Removed] has conveyed this sentiment repeatedly over the semester, I can't quote her directly on it. She has asked us before exams what learning strategies we believe will be effective for us to master the material.","We did an instapoll reflection on what worked for and didn't work for us for the first exam. This was meant to promote healthy and effective studying habits.","I don't remember the details","We were going over the syllabus \n The first day \n She explained that having the right methods are the base of physics","They explained that understanding the fundamentals of the concepts is better than blind memorization. They proposed creating reviews of all the concepts and studying the underlying subconcepts that make up the field.","He gave us an example when he was in college to help us relate to him which I find helpful. He also provides resources to help us achieve our   goals.","he would encourage us to utilize the tip css opportunities and tip office [Removed]","He tells us we have to be physically and mentally present. We have to participate in class and we will be fine.","To master the material, our instructors want us to thoroughly read the readings and give thoughtful replies in the discussion posts.

Then, she provides the answers and shows us common errors and lets us know how to learn from these issues.","She walks through mistakes and shows how they're wrong. This happened when we were learning about electron configuration and the exceptions. She showed us what students might answer, but then proceeds to show us the right answer and why.","She explains common misconceptions and how it is important to learn from them by showing possible mistakes people make in modules and study materials.","While going over a topic, our professor may demonstrate a problem the incorrect way to show how easy it is to make mistakes when not paying close attention. She then goes back and shows us the correct way to solve a problem while explaining why that is the correct method and why we should not follow the previous demonstration.","I took an exam last week for this course, and after I had taken the exam, she told the class how we can learn from our mistakes to do better on the next exams. She also informed us that we could retake this exam to earn a higher score and show how we have learned from our mistakes if we choose to do so.","Dr. [Removed] has explained to us that if we don't immediately understand a concept or do well on a test, it is ok because we can retake the test. For me, I did decent on the first test but made a couple of mistakes, but from those mistakes, I have learned. This frames mistakes as a way to learn, not a scary failure.","There's some BS questions but they are regrading which is nice","i don't remember what mistake but she definitely talked about common student mistakes","The instructor would point out mistakes students usually make in the first exam by providing word problems in her slides. The problems were neither too complex nor easy, so it gave us an idea of what to expect in the test. In - class quizzes are also an effort to help us understand which material we need to revise some more.","She allows us to have three attempts on our Learning Modules. Along with the opportunity to retake two exams for a better grade.","It was about the size of an ionic molecule and how to arrange them by size. In dispersion forces the bigger the molecule the more IMFs but in ionic its different rules so it was clarified.","The instructor went over common misconceptions. Next, she explained them through various approaches.","In class she has stated how making mistakes is a thing that happens among all people. Mistakes van be good because we learn from them and get better.","Dr. [Removed] allows plenty of room for mistakes when it comes to the learning modules assigned on [Removed]. This happens multiple times each week, and she has said multiple times that it is okay if we don't get everything right on the first try of the learning modules. She gives us three tries to submit the learning modules to earn full points on them.","The professor often goes over the most common student mistakes in a certain unit and will explain how to work through it properly. The professor also helps students work through their own mistakes and guides them to get the correct answer.","Shows what mistakes were made \n","Whenever we are doing practice problems as a class, the instructor would sometimes walk through common mistakes and use that as a learning opportunity.","She gives us the opportunity to our two lowest exam grades so that great.","When common mistakes are made in class, the professor goes over them and gives advice on how to avoid them.","Recently in class, she gave us a qestion that seems to have been commonly misinterpreted and after we answered the question she explained the thinking behind why it is different. Afterwards, she allowed us to reanswer the question with the new thinking / understanding","She says mistakes are good for learning","Describing mistakes that students often make in order to explain concepts","She points out typical mistakes people can make during class especially while preparing for exams and how to avoid them","If we made a mistake in the formula or calculation, she would explain what we did wrong, how we can do better, and sometimes re - explain the rule or concept so we would understand it better.","She made an error in the course, [Removed] lockdown browser. Before our first test, said that she encounters mistakes and will actively attempt to fix them.","During a lecture, she made a mistake while explaining a concept we needed to understand for a mathematical idea. When she made this mistake, she corrected herself and explained how it's okay to make mistakes because that's how you learn.","The professor doesn't really go into depth about topics. She also specifically said that since our class is the worst because of the “ whispering ”, she does not mention a lot of the content that would be on our exam …","During the lectures, she would give us an opportunity to try out a problem by ourselves and discuss it amongst ourselves. After a minute or so, she would bring everyone back and demonstrate how the problem is correctly done and some common mistakes that students have.","Professor [Removed] understands this class can be challenging and that chemistry isn't for everyone, so she is lenient on the grades and gives opportunities to build up our grades.","On every learning module, [Removed] allows us 3 retakes. This allows me to make mistakes and truly learn rather than worrying about getting the right answer on the first try.","The professor will do instapolls during class for attendance and it's okay if you get it wrong since it's a chance to test your knowledge. Also for learning modules, you get 3 tries to learn from your mistakes and earn a better score.","She has told us many times that for many concepts practice is necessary in order to be able to grasp a concept.","She doesn't make students feel bad for getting questions wrong and allows us to learn from it. She provides multiple resources to learn if we're confused. This is a normal thing in this class, and if someone gets it wrong she explains why it should be a different answer.","She let us talk and discuss about her question during the class. Even though we get wrong, this process shows how we can think and reach closer to the answers and how our thoughts are valuable even though the answer is not right","In Learning Module, we have three times to submit the quiz. I think this reduces pressure of not being wrong, and it becomes an opportunity to learn through mistakes.","After exam 1 around two weeks ago, Dr. [Removed] highlighted how well the tests generally went. After that, she noted how people who didn't do as well shouldn't fret and that mistakes are a natural part of the learning process. She continued by saying that there would be opportunities to learn from the mistakes made on the first exam and perform better on future exams and quizzes.","For example, during homework we get multiple attempts to ensure we can go back review and refresh.","the instructor would present incorrect options for multiple choice questions then help to explain why these options were incorrect and how we could change them to be correct","While doing examples problems and questions, my instructor showed common mistakes a student could make when solving those questions and said how to improve on it.","Around 2 weeks ago, we took our exam for Unit 1. This being our first exam, it was challenging. However, [Removed] offered help by looking at the exam and not counting problems where the wording may not have been the best. She then told us we would have a chance to show we mastered the topic before the end of the course.","In class, the instructor gives us some time to discuss the answer with our friends which we may make mistakes but after she explains the answer, we then truly understand the concept. Also, through homework, by giving us learning module and the chance of resubmitting, we can learn what mistakes we made and fix those.","Dr. [Removed] mentions how its important for us to make mistakes on instapoll and the quizzes so that we can do everything right on the exam. She mentioned this last class and has made sure to show us the importance of each assignment so that we learn that we should make mistakes before the exam.","Solved out a problem correctly and incorrectly.","We are given opportunities to redo course modules after learning from mistakes and complete a makeup final exam once we learn a unit better.","Dr. [Removed] reinforces that making mistakes are okay and normalized and can help us better understand the material.","The professor allows us to take a practice exam, and she lets us try it as many times as we want so that we can study from our mistakes and topics we aren't too familiar with.","Dr. [Removed] went over an [Removed] that most students missed during class and told us she could see why we would think the answer we chose was correct but went over the little mistake we made.","She might have said this when teaching the lewis structure. I believe she explained how some of the mistakes could help us do better as we will not make them again for a quiz / test.","She lets us retest and drop grades as a way to express mistakes are valuable learning opportunities.","When professor [Removed] goes over material whether that be in the course of during the modules she makes sure to point out mistakes sometimes students tend to make and warns us so we don't make them.","If we made a mistake on a practice review problem, she would work through it with us. In addition, she allows multiple attempts on learning modules for us to review and completely understand the concepts.","She makes mistakes and she will share stories about mistakes she made during her undergrad and post grad times. She explains common mistakes students make and how they fix them going into the test.","The instructor would explain where it is easy to make mistakes and explain how we can stop it from happening. This would happen very regularly when we were learning in class.","Dr. [Removed] explained each in detail when lecturing about [Removed] forces at the end of October. She explained the differences in them and also included common mistakes student make when getting them mixed up.","She often talks about how mistakes can be made in the concepts we learn and gives us tips on how to not make those mistakes ourselves.","Once there was a question that led us on to the wrong answer. She had us guess the wrong answer but then explained why it was wrong and how to avoid mistakes in these types of problems.","Dr. [Removed] allows students to retake up to two exams for their final because she understands it encourages students to learn from their mistakes if they did poorly on their first try. She allows us to retake any two exams or, if available, skip the final if we were to have already done well with the exams and not need the retakes.","We are able to do up to 2 replacement exams to replace 2 of our lowest exam scores. \n","[Removed] has emphasized how learning from mistakes can be valuable learning opportunities for the class as she allows exams to be retaken. Mistakes allow students to learn and better their understanding of course material they may not have initially understood.","I am not sure.","Dr. [Removed] will explain how some exams may have some tricky questions that some students tend to make mistakes on. She goes over these concepts and ensures we are prepared to face these somewhat difficult questions.","During lecture Dr. [Removed] goes over common mistakes. She showed why they are common and how to fix them.","after each exam, she never makes it a point to highlight how badly we might have done on the test as a class, but rather just reassures that it is okay and that we have plenty of opportunities to make it up. we are also given the replacement exams so we know that we will be okay.","Tells us the common mistakes that students make and points things out.","I believe this was referenced early on in the course, as Dr. [Removed] stated that she didn't expect students to perform like great scientists or completely understand / ace each exam. I believe she said that failure is a learning outcome every student should expect from the course and that it is inherently unavoidable.","In my chemistry course, the instructor guided the class through the mistakes to reinforce the importance of each step. The instructor said, \" Mistakes like these are common, and each one helps us understand the process more deeply, \" making the environment supportive and encouraging us to learn from errors without fear of judgment.","After our test, she reassured us that we can go to office hours to see how we can improve and learn from our mistakes.","Professor [Removed] will constantly point out what points in the material we are going over for the week that students often overlook or get wrong a lot, but reassures us with enough practice we will not fall to the same mistakes. She also makes sure of this with the many resources provided in her [Removed] because she provides a lot of practice.","The instructor has a positive outlook on mistakes as they help us improve.","The instructor went over common mistakes to make sure that we all understand the material.","During certain practice problems, we as students have performed mistakes while doing practice problems -- instead of brushing over the mistakes, we have gone over why it was not the correct answer. She included \" some people think [ this ], however \" and explained the thought process of the correct answer. Although, this is not very common.","I seem to remember that after the first exam, the professor encouraged us to use our score as a learning opportunity. We will have more opportunities to replace this grade so it's important to learn from the experience.","Our tests and learning modules after the test and for our learning modules. She said this verbally in class and made sure she gave us a chance to learn what we did wrong in our learning modules ( 3 chances )","The professor discusses common mistakes students make when learning new topics, provides practice examples of students' mistakes, and explains what to do instead in depth.","no [Removed] she be grading with instapolls","She has shown us common mistakes that may occur. Then, shows us where to go from there.","The instructor had written the electron configuration for a certain atom but had made a mistake. A student addressed the mistake and thanked the student for her help. She then made a statement about how it's great the student caught that and that it was a moment to test student confidence in the material. This happened early in the semester in one of the lectures.","Professor [Removed] frequently demonstrates how mistakes can be valuable learning opportunities for the class by encouraging us to reflect on previous moments in our lives when we have overcome challenges. This typically occurs before exams, when there is a lot of tension and internal pressure to excel. \" Turn to the person beside you and think about a time when you overcame something that you didn't succeed at the first time around, \" is something along the lines of what she might say.","She explains the importance of making mistakes in science because you learn more that way. This is inspiring.","Professor [Removed] allows you to take replacement exams during the final exam period to replace grades on previous unit tests. This allows you to prove that you master content after all of it is over, even if you didn't before. She said that every student should be rewarded for mastering the content even after mistakes.","We were encouraged to do practice problems and the practice exam to prepare for our actual exam. If we got something wrong, we could then find out which topics we struggle with and need improvement in. We had the opportunity to attend office hours and study communities to then learn how to solve the questions correctly.","The instructor draws how we would typically draw certain models such as [Removed] structures. Then, she explains how the certain example is an exception to the rule and explains why.","She cares that we actually learn and points out mistakesstudents might make but makes sure [Removed] know the right arsener","We have replacement exams in the class, so if you do not understand the material for an exam and do not do well, you can go to tutoring and take the replacement exam. These replacement exams make you realize that mistakes are okay.","The instructor went over how mistakes can lead to success, such that it gives you a good point to reflect. Using this info leads you to be a better student.","She teaches us from our mistakes.","She went over questions and highlighted common misconceptions about the topic. She then outlines the best way to tackle that same problem.","In the course, the instructor demonstrated how mistakes can be valuable learning opportunities by intentionally highlighting errors made during practice problems. This happened during a class session when students were working through chemical equations. The instructor calmly explained why the mistake happened, emphasizing how it provided insight into common misunderstandings and how we could avoid similar errors in the future. They said, \" Mistakes are a part of the learning process, and they help us understand the concepts even more clearly. \"","allows us to get it wrong then shows us what is correct","Our instructor makes it clear that we should learn from our mistakes by offering exam retakes, and multiple attempts for assignments. This demonstrates that our instructor values the knowledge students gain over their grades.","She talks about the exams and that even though we may have struggled we can relearn the material and at the end of the course retake the test.","Any time we make mistakes on questions in class, she is quick to comfort but also to explain it better. This makes it feel a little more okay to mess up and helps us learn better moving forward.","Provides keys and examples.","When doing active learning thingy during class she told us to talk with our neighbor and see what our answers were and to not be disappointed if we got it wrong we are learning about it.","Just 3 days ago, Dr. [Removed] emphasized that positive and negative signs are big deals in [Removed]. She emphasized that a lot of people think of themselves as the surrounding when instead they need to “ be the system ”. Explaining the implication of this mistake, helped us understand why we need to be the system and we're less likely to make this mistake since we discussed it in class","Going over missed questions on the Instapoll","Caudill demonstrates how mistakes can be valuable when she talks about improving after an exam. She offers two makeup exams to ensure that we can learn from our poor performance on a test and do better.","Usually, if someone makes a mistake in class or on an assignment, Dr. [Removed] will make sure they are corrected. She does not rudely correct people.","Each class after an exam, Dr. [Removed] explains how students can work on certain topics in the future to prepare for things they missed on the exam. She tells students what to watch out for on the exams during lectures as well.","She gives us replacement exams that we can do during the final exam period to help get points back. This helps tremendously. She said that this is because she believes that mastery is more important than test - taking and mistakes shouldn't be punished.","He encouraged us to look at what we got wrong. It's how we learn to fix our future mistakes.","She told us about how even if our soil samples came out poorly, or they get contaminated, or if any other mistakes occurred, it was still valuable and useable data.","When culturing, a group accidentally punctured the agar. The instructor told them that now they know how much strength is too much, and demonstrated the process again. Then they gave the group another plate to try again.","The instructor has emphasized that students can reach out if they would like to ask questions on any mistakes they have made. The lab is set up in a way that you can ask her or the TAs for help in learning from mistakes on quizzes and other assignments through office hours.","Last class, I had a bit of agar hanging off my plate which had touched the [Removed] coli bacteria. I asked how I should go about removing it as I poked at it with my toothpick. Our TA strongly advised me against that and showed me how to properly remove the slimy piece.","She would always state how it is okay to make mistakes as we can learn from our mistakes and have a better attempt. She demonstrated that through mistakes scientists have been able to improve their techniques and discover new knowledge.","Mistakes are okay because sometimes in science we make mistakes. We can always learn or ask why something did not produce an expected result","One thing that [Removed] did really well was always have a backup if mistakes happened so that we could learn from them. One time I remember when we were gram - staining and my lab partner messed up their slide, but [Removed] told us to literally use that as a means to do better on the back - up slide.","During [Removed], gram staining, streak isolation, functioning miscropes, mistakes were a number factor to learn from your mistakes because if you messed up the first day you understood the mistake and was able to execute it the second time which allowed more accurate results for your group to learn on.","n / a","During our second [Removed] trial, the wrong primers were ordered. The [Removed] posted it on canvas and explained what had happened and the results we were getting in our [Removed] because of it. The primers that got mistakenly ordered provided better and clearer results than the original primers and our instructor said she was investigating with her team to figure out why. She had a positive outlook on the mistake.","In the course we were typically provided with a day to practice a technique before they were actually performed on our soil isolates. This allowed us to make mistakes that did not have a significant impact on our research, and we were able to correct the mistakes before we conducted the experiment on the soil isolates.","Did something wrong during lab but instead of having negative consequences and punishments was given opportunity to fix my mistake.","In our lab when we messed up a procedure, our instructor patiently stood with us and let us take the time to correct our own mistakes.","In lab mistakes happen often and are not necessarily due to the direct error made by a student. In class, mistakes or errors are used as teaching moments to learn what not to do or to note what caused those undesirable results and to avoid them.","I don't really remember this happening during this semester","The instructor would discuss how mistakes can be valuable learning opportunities for the class as the instructor would discuss common mistakes during experiments and how to learn from them. The instructor would stop us halfway through an experiment to discuss mistakes and how to fix them, for the next time.","During one of the labs, my lab partners subcultured wrongly from the [Removed] [Removed] onto a subculture plate. We thought that this would've completely ruined our whole sample and overall organization, but the instructors quickly provided a solution and explained that it was an easily fixable mistake. This allowed us to learn to approach all mistakes with a clear, conscious mind.","She mentions common mistakes that people make during lab procedures. The first couple of classes were used to test out the equipment and she didn't make us feel bad for making mistakes. She instead told us what we were doing wrong so we don't do it again.","While explaining procedures the instructor catches the attention of the class and shares helpful information.","When participating in lab activities making a mistake can be easy to do. The instructors allow you to re - do it and correct your work.","I made a mistake in collecting data by taking sample from the middle of the colony and not the edge ( where we supposed to ). The instructors allowed us to retake our sample to ensure we have the proper material to work with and correct our mistake.","A week ago, just about everyone in lab did the pick and patch onto master plates incorrectly ( they took from the center of the colonies instead of the edges, so our TA explained the issue and many of us replated multiple colonies.","when failing on lab stuff such as culturing, you can redo to get better results and compare to learn from the previous mistake","One of our soil dilutions plates were messed up and we had to redo them and they were supportive.","We learn how to correct our lab techniques.","I can't lie, I do not want remember","She explained how the mistakes with the primers is a good learning experience","If we make a small mistake with the procedure, sawyer will not penalize us but correct us on the first mess up.","A few times throughout the semester, I have made a mistake while conducting an experiment, and [Removed] did not exaggerate the impact of my error.","When we make mistakes in class, the TA understands that this happens and helps us fix our mistakes. After that, mistakes rarely happen.","We almost always practice a lab procedure before we do it with our soil isolates. That way, we can make mistakes and be prepared for the real procedure.","The instructor reassures us that mistakes are okay when we do make mistakes, which usually makes me feel better about missing a step in the procedures or accidentally doing a step wrong. She also makes sure we know what we did wrong and why it was wrong, as well as giving us the opportunity to redo our mistakes.","One time we executed a lab ( [Removed] + [Removed] electrophoresis ) first with sample bacterial isolates and then with our actual soil isolates. This enabled our group to make mistakes initially with the samples but subsequently improve upon them when it mattered as we worked with our bacterial isolates.","Sawyer talks about the mistakes she experienced within her other lab sections and warns us to not do the same. However, it is easily seen that [Removed] understands that we as students are not perfect and is very lenient with small errors.","During a lecture on linkage and gene mapping, our instructor was encouraging us to solve a problem.   They insisted that even though we could get the answer wrong, it would be best to try to answer to the best of our abilities as it can allow us to understand where we went wrong and improve upon it.","Yes, yes, yes! At the beginning of the first week of class, Dr. [Removed] showered us with growth mindset videos and made sure we knew that we belonged in the classroom. She always tells us that we can grow our skills and that \" genetics is never the sole determinant for any trait \".","When working through tricky problems, she often points out where students may tend to make mistakes and immediately offers a different pathway to think about this. Further, she is constantly reminding us that it's okay to get questions wrong as it's how we learn the correct thinking behind the correct answer.","My professor will use Instapolls to test our knowledge. It is a great way to check my understanding and I really appreciate how she opens them after class, so I can get a good grade.","Our teacher allows us to correct our mistakes in many ways. We are allowed to retake quizzes for example.","After exams, Dr. [Removed] allows students to schedule 1 on 1 sessions that allow you to go over each mistake made and learn how to avoid doing so in the future.","Dr. [Removed] has often discussed how struggling on an exam is not a bad thing, but often a chance for growth and learning. She will discuss our mistakes on the exams and asks for our input on if we have questions about our mistakes on exams and previous homework assignments.","During our instapolls, hw, worksheets and tests, we go over the answers in order to understand what went wrong in our thinking and to understand what can be done better next time.","After the exam grades are released, our instructor offers one - on - one times, so each student can talk individually with the professor or TA to go over mistakes made on the exam.","During class, all throughout the semester, my teacher has told us the values of leaning from our exams. She repeatedly tells us how it is important to learn and grow, not dwell on the past, especially for exams.","Dr. [Removed] considers mistakes a key part to learning. In her syllabus, she states that she wants students to persevere through failure by seeking help and that it's okay to make mistakes. She always tries to make sure that students are doing well inside and outside of class. If a student doesn't fully understand something, she'll do her best to help the student learn and grasp the concept.","As mentioned before, she encourages active participation in class discussions or office hour sessions. She tells us to not be afraid of making mistakes as they are always learning opportunities and that if we didn't make mistakes in the first place, we likely won't be here learning together.","If I remember correctly, someone made a mistake while trying to identify where a segregation error occurred during meiosis, and Dr. [Removed] stopped to explain how the concept worked as well as made sure to note that it would be frequently tested so we should be 100 % sure we understood it.","We sometimes make errors during class in instapolls or when talking to the whole class. However, when this happens, she uses our mistakes to teach the whole class about common errors and what the correct answer is.","We have gone through many extra credit assignments that highlight our lives as students outside of this class and how important \" negative \" aspects of life like failure are. Dr. [Removed] is not afraid of bringing up wellbeing and making sure we are all doing well as people.","Instructor reviewed concepts that students struggled with. Provided both an explanation for how to improve and did not speak in a negative manner regarding the mistakes.","The instructor maintains a judgment - free environment, believing that mistakes are valuable learning opportunities that enhance our understanding and growth. \n\n","Dr. [Removed] constantly says that our mistakes are a great learning opportunity. This really helps with student mindset and encouraging growth from misunderstanding / mistakes.","Always gives us a second chance to understand why we got a question wrong","If a group or a person asks a question or answers is kind of left field, then she would gently guide them to the right direction. Others around that group or person would try to help that person to the right answer. This demonstrates the professor and class' willingness to help each other. There was also a rule set for the classroom that states we shouldn't be afraid to ask a question or speak up.","A student was nervous to answer a question in class and Dr. [Removed] told the class that it is okay to make mistakes. She told us that it is important to make mistakes because they help us grow and develop our skills further.","Gives us 2 opportunities on quizzes to learn from mistakes","Mainly verbal, a student had an answer got it wrong, and then the lead instructor went through the possible reasons for getting it wrong and how to approach such a problem in the future to mitigate wrong answers.","She would ask us why something is wrong and what misconception we had, emphasizing that mistakes are learning opportunities and that if someone is confused, it's likely others are also confused.","A student miscalculated the genotype ratios for a dihybrid cross during a genetics lab on [Removed] squares. Rather than continuing, the teacher stopped the lesson, explained the student's error in detail, and illustrated how it may cause misconceptions when forecasting inheritance patterns. \" Mistakes like these are great because they show where our understanding can improve — let's work through it together, \" the instructor encouraged everyone, transforming the mistake into a teaching moment for the class as a whole.","The professor will often take wrong responses to questions in class with the polling assignments and demonstrate the way to correctly think about the question without belittling incorrect responses.","Dr. [Removed] encourages students to answer questions regardless if they are wrong in class because if we are wrong then we can grow from our mistakes together. Dr. [Removed] is very supportive about giving in class examples our best answers because there is always opportunity to grow.","Before and after the exams, she sends a message via [Removed] reminding us that the score doesn't necessarily define our self - worth or intelligence level. She also says to step back and re - evaluate our study methods to better understand how we can better prepare for the next exam.","She would go over different concepts that could be confusing, and would explain how to do them. She would encourage us to do it independently, and explain how common misconceptions that we had were plausible and how to rectify it.","[Removed] will always remind us to learn from our mistakes and take breathers","Sometimes, mistakes are made when answering questions and he never gets mad or makes us feel dumb.","After our first test he discussed how mistakes do not represent who we are","We watched a video and then as a class discussed how our mistakes can be valuable in the learning process.","Giving us practice problems in class so we are ready for exams and homework","Asked us to submit a reflection","Professor talks about how you can learn from mistakes or how to improve.","The instructor showed us a video in lecture of someone failing at a task, and gave us advice to not beat ourselves up over a mistake, and instead take it as an opportunity to learn. He recommended us to take a break and not let our mistakes define us.","With the instapolls we are able to learn from our mistakes. This is helpfully for us","I think he talked about how mistakes help you know how to approach a physics problem when we were discussing one of the homeworks.","Maybe it was the 3rd week of class, Dr. [Removed] spoke about how mistakes aren't bad while we were going over a practice problem and that we should use the mistake to learn even if it's frustrating.","After exams, we can see our scores and what we missed on quest, and he'll encourage us to go to office hours to work out the problems we missed.","The first exam took place on a Monday and on class Wednesday the professor went over the idea that exams do not determine your identity. He went over the idea that mistakes are a way for us to learn and know what we need to improve and work on and that we are fully capable of performing well.","The instructor shows up experiments and projects in the past that have failed and how people overcame challenges to make things a success. He also motivates and reminds us to look at things from a growth mindset perspective.","Dr. [Removed] always expands and explains when someone provides an incorrect answer to a question he poses in class","It was after the first exam. Dr. [Removed] said that it is good to acknowledge when you or others make mistakes. It's a kind gesture to make someone feel less lousy about a wrong answer by saying that \" it's okay \", but it is still a wrong answer, so it's better to find a response that 1 ) doesn't shame them or not knowing the answer but also 2 ) acknowledges that its a wrong answer. By acknowledging something is wrong, then you can take the required steps to determine how to get right answer \n\n Additionally, during Office Hours, he often states that a healthy amount of frustration is actually very good for learning. If you're frustrated while doing a problem, then that is a good sign the problem is challenging enough and you are learning something. However, you shouldn't be so frustrated that the problem is making you upset because that means the problem is too difficult AND you aren't actually learning anything at all","There was an example given for the lunar lander. That's about it. We are part of a process where mistakes are the way the separate us….where is the incentive to make mistakes?","The professor led a open discussion among students on what they do when they make mistakes. Afterwards he showed a video clip from a movie that demonstrated the proper way to deal with a mistake. Afterwards, he said \" It is important to not sweep mistakes under the rug and to go over them to learn from them \".","Instapoll questions serve as an opportunity for us to test our knwoledge and make mistakes so that in the future it won't happen again","The instructor always tells us how the first exam is not going to make or break your class grade. There is always ways to make it up with the second exam by learning from your mistakes.","After the first exam, he said don't put yourself down too much and that mistakes can be valuable opportunities. I do not recall what he said after that.","He showed us common mistakes during a lecture when math was involved","When we do practice problems, he gives us feedback on how we did.","We discuss growth mindset alot in the course which I greatly appreciate.","He wanted us to discuss with our neighbors what was difficult on our exam and what mistakes we made.","Dr. [Removed] talks about the importance of growth mind set nearly every class.","This happened about a week after the exam on a Monday during class. What happened was that Dr. [Removed] was discussing the exam that we had taken the week before about our grades and discussing with the class what are things that we struggled with on the exam and ideas about ways to improve our grades. He said that he wouldn't be giving curves on the exam because that is the easy way out and you do not learn from your mistakes, but instead gave us the opportunity to take another exam to earn credit back, working with our peers and applying what we learned from our mistakes.","A look over common mistakes in a exam after it was taken","Dr.perera often talks about having a growth mindset.","He talks about growth mindset every class period","After we took midterm 2, he made sure that we all saw it as a learning opportunity to build off of.","He mentions growth mindset and shows some examples of the survey we had of student's thoughts on growth mindset and how to implement it more in our class.","When the majority of us this bad on the 2nd midterm he taught us about the importance of the growth mindset and allowed us a retake to show we had learned from our mistakes.","Retake exam allowed students to have growth mindset","Exam analysis forms are sent out for students to reflect on what went well and what could have gone better for them on exam days.","There was an exam reflection assignment after the first exam. This allowed us to reflect on our mistakes and create better study habits.","After our first exam, we did an analysis reflecting on our work","Our instructor will go over several commonly missed questions from our unit exams, and he stresses to us that mistakes allow students to learn and grow in their academics. He has done this for our first exam, and he plans to do this in our future exams during this course.","He shows the grade distribution of the test scores and goes over the most commonly missed questions. Since we have only had one test, it happened on September 20th. I do not remember the specific words that my instructor said before, but during the review, he said to make sure we are reading carefully and that it can lead to simple mistakes.","It's ok if you don't know the process, just make sure you understand the process. He also allows us to fill out forms that identify what questions we got wrong on the exam, why we got it wrong, and what we can do to study better. Completion of this form gives up to 5 points extra credit.","I can't remember a specific time.","The instructor would go through past exams following the grade releases and go through commonly missed questions. He would explain these questions during class and help us better understand the concepts we missed- in an effort to help us for the final exam when these concepts will reappear.","he often understands mistakes made by students in - class and clarifies things.","Dr. [Removed] replaces one of your midterms test with your final exam grade so I believe that shows there is space to make mistakes","He showed us opportunities to get points back. He also showed us questions that could be repeated on tests and how we can do better in the future.","Whenever we do [Removed] questions and our class as a whole got a question completely wrong, he guides us through the question and lets us know why the other answer is correct. He doesn't shame us for getting it wrong ; rather, he teaches us the importance of thinking through the question.","After we took an exam we had to do an exam analysis worksheet so that we could see what types of questions we got wrong so that we could see how we could better study for the next tester. Like whether we did not know content or were more faced by application.","He provides post - exam reflection sheets that show what questions we missed and why we missed them. With this, we can see what we need to reflect on and how we need to change in order to fix our mistakes. This happens after every exam, which there are 4.","We had out first exam ( I forgot when ) but it was mentioned that after the first exam, we would be able to adjust our studying habits depending on how we did This implied that if we made many mistakes, we could turn them into opportunities to learn and make sure the next exam goes better","She will purposefully show common R code mistakes. She then explains solutions on how to solve them.","I wouldn't say for certain that the professor explicitly said this, but during lecture time we routinely go over worksheet assignments where they go over important functions and errors that students usually do.","She will always start the class with a example of incorrect code and ask us to tell what went wrong. She also demonstrates that mistakes are very common in coding and sometimes we just have to play around with the code to finally figure it out and be comfortable with it","When students are stuggling with the in class examples, the professor is very encouraging and reminds us that we learn most when we fail and that it is all apart of the learning process, especially when learning to code.","Prof said to learn from mistakes in coding by reading errors signs","We go through the keys on our own to see the mistakes we've made on the lecture notes and homeworks.","Professor uses solutions provided by students to answer questions as we walk through the notes. Even if the student is incorrect, the professor will hear the student out and walk through any errors in the resulting code.","They walked through a common error and let students answer in class and correct whatever mistakes they make","During live coding in the class the instructor may accidentally mess up. She then uses this opportunity to show how even she as an experienced coder may mess up. She also shows us how to troubleshoot the issue.","Professor [Removed] makes this very clear during her classes, as she allows us some time to do each exercise in the worksheets before she corrects them.","Sometimes Dr. [Removed] will put intentional coding errors in the worksheets, which helps to illustrate common ways that coding can go awry.","When working through the worksheets in class","The professor simply said “ that s close ” or that s almost right when someone was wrong. She encouraged more participation to reach correct answer.","Dr. [Removed] frequently talks about how getting errors in your code is how students learn and if you need help, go to drop - in hours. She also goes through questions students bring up so she can demonstrate if their ideas error or work and then explains the outcome.","Frequently mentions common mistakes for R code, in lecture and even in homework assignments / notes to prevent students from making mistakes","Every week when we are going over R codes, she will always show us what student commonly use and explain why it's wrong but also states that we care thinking in the right track.","When coding mistakes are very common, Dr. [Removed] has emphasized. She has taught us how to read errors given to us in R, in order to correct our mistakes.","The professor shows what mistakes we make in our code and shows us how to fix it and prevent it in the future. Also, at the beginning of every class, she shows us potential mistakes in code and we have to fix them.","Whenever a student made a mistake in answering a question, the professor was always encouraging.","When data was pulled from [Removed] of [Removed] website, she stepped thought common mistakes that can occur and went over solutions.","[Removed] has a lot of mistakes and she is able to help us","Our instructor has done over common mistakes and how the whole class can learn","In our daily coding worksheets, she encourages to try to solve problems on our own and to learn from the mistakes we make through trial and error","Since we go through the worksheets together, there are sometimes errors that we work through which are useful to see how to debug.","In our first activity of the day every day we walk through a common [Removed] error message related to something we learned the day before and how to fix it.","We were doing the [Removed] hall problem 2 weeks ago, and it was a whole lesson so it is hard to say specific things but the main take away was that this statistical truth was \" unintuitive. \"","Dr. [Removed] does not put someone down for a mistake, instead, she discusses how that thought process may of occurred and then how to do better in the future.","We are always reminded of this by our professor as she knows that R studio can be very difficult at first. The TAs are also very encouraging and after every question they make sure that everything was understood and encourage me for future problems.","Dr. [Removed] always encourages people to answer and even when the answer is wrong she makes it seem like the incorrect answer was a perfectly reasonable one and then shares why the thinking behind that makes sense but is wrong. A specific example of this happening was when, during class, someone tried to say that her correct answer was wrong and she emphasized that we should always check her answer for mistakes because she could just as easily write down an incorrect answer.","When she asks us to tell her what we got for a problem, she points out how that line of thinking is erroneous and common and how to fix it. She's good at brinign students who are off the mark into the fold of understanding.","She will provide examples of how the question could be interpreted incorrectly.","During class, [Removed] will ask students in the class to participate. If a student answers incorrectly, she takes the opportunity to demonstrate how their answer is wrong and how to get to the correct answer.","Within R - [Removed], Dr. [Removed] encourages students to not get discouraged with code doesn't work, She even helped me with my project code that I was struggling with 2 weeks ago.","After taking our quizzes in the lab, Dr. [Removed] would go over the quizzes during lecture ; that way, the students are allowed to see what they missed. This helps students so that we are able to learn from our mistakes, which helps us do better on the next quiz.","She gives us opportunities to earn points back.","When it was the day we went through the syllabus she informed us that we would be allowed to resubmit assignments like homework for a better grade. She called them a regrade.","Has mentioned how mistakes made on quizzes or homeworks can allow students to learn what their confused on and improve on that material.","each week students submit a survey with topics that have been difficult to understand. The professor then follows up with clarification for the topics students are having the hardest time with. \" Muddiest points \" is what they are called.","Dr. [Removed] usually speaks about this in the beginning of class, especially when we are doing learning activities together. She would say that we should speak up and it's okay to be wrong.","Reached out to all those who did not do as well to ensure they have plenty of time to make it up and gave words of encouragement.","She does give out optional reading quizzes every week and gives us unlimited amount of tries and is not graded.","Sometimes in the class, she tells everyone that it is okay to reply to questions that you do not have the answer to. Answering wrong only seemed like a chance to grow and learn in her perspective which was good","The TA goes over the most missed questions on the exam during discussion","The instructor, before an exam, stated common mistakes that students in the past would get confused with. She would then explain the correct answer.","She talks about her experiences and allows other students to chime in about their own experiences as well.","The instructor consistently gives personal accounts of how they have made mistakes in their educational studies and learned from this. The instructor encourages the class to apply this while in the class by giving opportunities to make errors and resolve them.","She always reminds us that making mistakes is simply a part of the journey and is valuable.","The most recent one I can think of happened last week when she was discussing how she had implicit bias against other women in higher fields of study. She mentioned that science used to be a male - dominated field which led to a lot of her colleagues belittling her and being misogynistic. At some point, she was getting on a flight and there were two pilots greeting people onboard, one of which was a short woman. She assumed that the female pilot was the trainee and the male pilot had more experience. When she was informed that the female pilot was the more experienced one, she quickly realized her mistake and understood how her internal [Removed] came to the surface even when she didn't mean to be insulting.","Most classes start with a preface that she has made mistakes in her career and encourages us to see them opportunities to learn and improve.","Dr. [Removed] shares a lot of her own experiences and uses those to teach us that mistakes can help us grow","She provides retakes on exams, gives credit for trying on the squarecap questions, and allows for homework answers to be wrong the first time before losing credit. I think all of these are demonstrations of allowing us to view mistakes as learning opportunities.","The instructor brought up common errors or ways of thinking about concepts and clarified if it was correct logical thinking or if we should perceive a concept in another manner.","She allows retakes so that we may learn from our mistakes in the 1st try. These are extremely helpful","She always talks about how failure is an opportunity to learn.","She would go through practice problems during class and show us common pitfalls / things that can go wrong when solving the problem. She wrote notes on what to look for to guide us.","we can get a question wrong on the first exam then learn from our mistakes and get it correct on the retake","n / a","The Prof. would demonstrate a problem and if she made a mistake during class it allows us to understand how that would occur and what to avoid.","After the results from our first exam came out, the instructor encouraged us to not be discouraged if we got a low grade. He mentioned how he did not do well on his first physics exam as well when he was an undergraduate. He emphasized how it's okay to not do well and make mistakes, and the best thing we could do is keep studying and ask questions.","Professor uses insta poll to collect attendance and allows student to learn through mistakes","The instructor lets us retake all tests, learning from our mistakes on previous tests, to improve our score on the retakes. This allows us to realize how mistakes can be a valuable learning opportunity. He also mentions how he failed his first college physics exam, as many of us might have, but that he learnt from it and is now a professor of physics.","Has policies on retake exams and releases homework keys to learn what you missed","After the first exam the professor informed us how it's important to learn from mistakes and okay to make them. He then talked about how he didn't do very well on his first physics exams.","For each exam there is an optional make up exam for full credit one week later. For each homework if you get a question wrong, you can try again multiple times.","He mentioned how he failed his intro physics and told the story of what he did to improve his grades.","He let us know how he failed his first physics exam. He then went on to be a physics professor after failing so he learned from his mistakes","He shared how he did rather poorly on his first ever physics exam for undergraduate and graduate school, and now he is a physics professor and researcher!","[Removed] TA was very helpful during multiple discussion sections with calling us out on mistakes and helping us come up with the correct solutions","Going through [Removed] in class to check comprehension, allows students to solve and then goes through common errors so that everyone understands","He always encourages students to point out his mistakes in class and even hands out a reward for it to show that mistakes happen and it's not something to be frowned upon. He also does instapolls where he tries to guide us to learn from mistakes we make on them.","Professor makes it a point to point out common mistakes. The professor often points out these mistakes and why they happen so that students don't make the mistake in the future.","When someone answers one of the squarecaps wrong, he listens, explains their answer, and then asks other studetns for answers. He will then go over why the answer was wrong in the first place.","He doesn't criticize mistakes as much as other teachers and is very open to being corrected, which I like. He goes over mistakes that we might make in class, and he answers questions that prevent us from making certain mistakes. I had a question about torque which if unanswered, I would have not understood the concept properly, but he gave a very thorough explanation and asked if it made sense and if he properly answered my question. We also can get half credit back on exams.","He permits us to redo our assignments for partial credit ; however, we are required to explain the question and identify where we made mistakes in order to enhance our understanding.","The assignments are on expert ta and we are allowed multiple attempts for each question which is quite helpful and we also receive hints and feedback which is a great help when I want to improve and learn from my previous mistakes. We also have exam redos which have helped a great deal in ensuring that I don't repeat the same mistakes. It is also nice because there is an incentive for the exam redo which helps us want to learn from our mistakes and also earn credit for it.","My professor allows us to correct our tests up for half credit if we do thorough corrections. He also includes one question from the test before on the following test to ensure we are learning from our mistakes.","As grades were finalized for our first test Dr. [Removed] made sure we all knew that this test did not define us. He said that we would be able to view our missed questions to better our learning and understanding of the course.","Last week after our last test he covered how our class did. He reassured us that if you didn't do great this is only the first exam, he's available during office hours to go over your exam, and shared how he struggled early on when taking physics.","This was when he was going over Exam 1 and talking about how the exam was difficult so that we can learn the concepts that we misunderstood and can do better on the following exams.","She will go over any questions the students may have about material that is harder to grasp.

Encourages us to speak up even when possibly wrong.","The instructor allowed for students to send in questions through canvas which she would cover in case students were afraid to ask in class. This happens every lecture.","She provides opportunities to learn as every week she requires you to find what you need help in and share what has been challenging for you while being supportive and not shaming those with questions.","A few weeks ago a student answered a question and it wasn't correct. The professor explained that this is a very common misconception and explained both why he was incorrect and also why the correct answer was correct.","During the lecture, the instructor asks questions to the students and emphasizes that it's okay to give the wrong answer because it helps everyone learn. Additionally, she emphasizes that not everything in science is correct, so it's important to learn from mistakes.","Dr. [Removed] frequently talks about the importance of making mistakes and learning from them through our experience in her class. She specifically brings this up around when we take her quizzes every other week because they are weighted heavily compared to other assignments. She tells us to trust ourselves and prepare well, despite any setbacks or mistakes we make.","You can learn from them.","Throughout the course Dr. [Removed] has mentioned that physics is a difficult course and that it is okay tomorrow understand things well, and that there is always room for improvement.","During example questions our professor would emphasize making mistakes now which can help in learning the material.","She has zombie questions for future exams to learn and improve. In addition homework questions allow for multiple tries.","She referenced another [Removed] professor who had failed physics the first time he took it. Failing is an integral part of the learning process, and happens and sometimes facilitates even better understanding the material","Whenever students get answers incorrect, she does her best to explain the right answer in a non - condescending manner.","Showed us how to approach problems in different ways, one wrong way and a one right way","Mentioned that homework mistakes are learning opportunities. \n","He put \" zombie questions \" for each exams, which are the questions that the students mostly got wrong from the past exams.","During my office hours, I had been making a lot of errors in solving a problem but Dr. [Removed] helped me find the right path of thinking in approaching the problem and by doing so, I was able to learn that my previous mistakes were part of the process of answering the question, but I had just done it in the wrong order.","Well when we do questions during class time the purpose of him doing them is to make mistakes during in class time because it is low stakes and so you can ask questions,","During daily [Removed], he will review the common mistakes that can be made during the work and why it is wrong and how we can learn","He set a tone of hope for us the very first day of class by sharing his story of overcoming bad grades in physics himself. He also says 3 most missed questions from the previous exam will be on the next exam, encouraging us to look over the entire exam after we get them back.","I feel like he does this from every instapoll that we do. He explains the question, and its just a learning experience.","The instructor provides \" zombie \" problems on exams ; these may revisit you on the next exam. This has motivated me to consistently refresh my knowledge as well as genuinely learn what I did wrong on the previous exam to help me on the next one.","There have been scenarios in which the instructor has talked about mistakes and willing to learn and grow from them. Especially as a freshman, it is easy to make mistakes and still adjust to a new environment.","Around the first week of the course, along with the TA, explained to us that mistakes were opportunities for growth and we shouldn't let them define us.","This was at the beginning of the school year and we were talking about how things might not always go the way we plan. My instructor reminded us that it's ok to fail or not have things work out right the first time. She reminded us that it's important to continue and push through.","My professor, how to understand how we could improve on our mistakes by reviewing what we did wrong and learning ways to prevent making the sea mistake again in the future in similar situations.","We would talk about how things like this are important for growth and everyone makes mistakes and it is okay.","[Removed] always gives us personal examples. It helps us be able to apply it to ourselves.","He always says that we are not competitors but collaborators.","Again, our grades and assignments are primarily dependent on attendance. She tells us to show up.","The instructor teach us that mistakes also contribute with discoveries. Mistakes can be for good.","I know Dr. [Removed] often references past mistakes of students, and this makes it really easy. That way, a big siren goes off in my brain whenever I use that formula or think about that concept to make sure I don't make the same mistake.","After the first midterm it was clear that a lot of students still were struggling. And although he did a good job at mentioning the resources available, there wasn't a lot of clarification on how to fix those mistakes that were made in the exam.","Dr. [Removed] often tells us during lecture where people will go wrong, whether that be using the wrong constant, incorrect units, etc. He often points out where students typically struggle the most to make sure we focus on that.","This was after the first exam. The average was low on the first exam, so the instructor told us to look over the questions we missed and prepare better on the next exam.","Rework problems \n","This is also covered in the excerpts we see from previous students that she presents at the beginning of class. She gives us the opportunity to replace grades if we show we have learned the material later in the semester.","After our first midterm, the professor talked about how she got a 27 on a midterm her first semester of college, and how she ended up going on to still be successful.","The idea that working through the problems, making mistakes, and learning from them is very important was pushed on us heavily.","When there is a difficult problem in class, the professor will let the students have enough time to think about it, and encourage them to answer the question, emphasizing repeatedly that making mistakes is normal and not terrible.","We are encouraged to answer questions in class even if we might make mistakes. The instructor always demonstrates how mistakes can be valuable learning opportunities for the class.","The professor has mentioned it like one time only.","Instapolls provide us an opportunity to work out the problems on our own and learn from our / peer's mistakes.","The most memorable instance of the instructor allowing students to learn from their mistakes is the presence of retests. The instructor releases the answers and explanations from the midterm before the retests so that students understood where they went wrong during the midterm and can demonstrate their new understanding through a second chance.","During the Tuesday lecture this week, Dr. [Removed] had asked several students to present their solutions to a problem. She intentionally hid her choice in her speaking, and encouraged students to speak up whatever their choice was. After she later revealed the answer, she once again said something along the line of, “ Making mistakes is not a problem. When you learn, you must make mistakes. What matters is that you understand it in the end. ”","Our instructor referenced himself on a past mistake when he was a student that caused him to end up dropping a course. However, he concluded his story by saying that we should take advantage of the opportunities given to us like going to office hours because he did not do that during his time. He learned from his mistakes and told us to do the same if we have ever gone through something similar.","He showed us an analogy with a sponge that showed how using the wring study methods can hurt you. He taught us to learn from it and not to dwell on it too much.","He used sponges to show us how our brain could potentially absorb things. He also explained the differences in learning to study and how you can learn from that to do better the next time","When discussing concepts such as office hours or registration, We discuss common failures or personal shortcomings as cautionary tales for the class.","Once in a writing assignment, one of my instructors said that it was okay if it sounded like professional writing because we ( the class ) were beginners and later on in the future we will be able how to write good and understand concepts on readings and assignments."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

After that she will also explain how to get to the right answer.","When ever she notices that students are not understanding the quiz question provided in class, she will repeat the question while providing an example to think more about or try to explain in a different way, and then ask the question. This provides a lot of clairty.","After our second exam, the instructor asked us what we thought the most difficult questions were. Then, we talked through how to solve them. Next, the instructor showed us how to work through the most commonly missed question. This took place the next class meeting after our exam and before the retake exam. The instructor stressed that they wanted us to understand our mistakes so we could learn from them. They also acknowledged the question was very difficult which was reassuring to hear as a student.","we get exam retakes each midterm","Before the exam and the exam retake, Dr. [Removed] will talk about missed questions on the exams and what might have tripped students up. She will also give advice on what to do to make sure you improve your score for the retake.","The instructor talked about test scores and allowed us to get our test back to look over. Then, we took the retest.","Always explains practice problems and common areas of trouble. Reviews exams and results and determines what is giving students issues.","The professor would work through problems to show why a student is incorrect and where to improve in future questions.","Dr. [Removed] will do this after exams and talk about the most missed questions.","When going over a new topic or reviewing an old one, he will walk through the common mistakes students will make. These will be common conceptual and mathematical errors that students ask him about during office hours and those he sees on tests.","Covers some problems in class, installs","In class when giving examples, he might tell us a situation where people usually get confused. This helps with homework or exams.","He would go through instapolls and where people could make a mistake","During class, Professor [Removed] would run instapolls on canvas in order to determine how well the class is understanding the content of the lecture. Additionally, he will also sometimes give example problems in lectures based on which homework problems we were struggling with ( Like the flux through only one face of a cube ).","I can't think of a specific moment.","He taught","In our discussion period, we are allowed to go over questions that we missed. Here, we can request to go over questions we missed. Often times, there will be one or two questions that a lot of students request because we all missed it.","In his midterms he provides the possibility of re taking it and keeps the highest grade","We do instapolls in class, and whenever he sees that a lot of people are getting a question wrong, he goes through and explains the mistake that they are making.","When having homework assignments due each week he drops hints about how to go about some of them. And breaks down any questions in office hours and what will be on the exams","Dr. [Removed] mentioned during class that a concept we were covering is generally on the exam and students tend to miss it, so he gave us an instapoll over it to make sure it stuck.","There was a question about an infinite circuit on the homework 1 month ago and someone asked how to approach the problem. He stated that many students solve it incorrectly by doing a method he showed was wrong, but he then showed the correct method to approaching the problem. He wrote down the homework problem and asked the class if anyone wants to go over it. He then proceeded to go through it step by step and explain everything thoroughly.","Occasionally we will go over a problem featured in one of the homework assignments. This gives us the opportunity rethink how we did the problem and how to approach it if we haven't done it yet.","A few days before the hmw is due, he'd go over the problems people said they were having trouble with.","He does this by offering redos and at office hours going over what you may have done wrong / approached incorrectly","When working out a problem on the board he showed a common mistake that students make. This happened during lecture after a student asked a question. The instructor explained the right way to do it afterwards.","Prior to the first exam, he had an entire class dedicated to answering questions about the test including sections where he would solve a problem on the board and would ask people how they would solve the problem. If the student got it incorrect, he would show what mistake they made and then showed how to correctly solve the problem.","every class, he asks if people have any concerns or questions, and he also goes over the common questions people asked in the pre - lectures. He does a good job at letting us try different ways of solving a problem before he goes over the final answer and makes sure he understands what we are having trouble on and tries to break it down as much as he can.","The class before an exam the instructor will do review and go over practice problems and common mistakes.","After an exam or even after the squarecaps we often go over mistakes that students had trouble with. Usually in details without singling out any individual students","After the first exam, the instructor explained how some students ignored the [Removed] [Removed] waals equation when solving a problem. He explained how we can overcome this error in future exams as well.","After the midterm, the professor talks about some common error we had in the exam and help us to correct them.","On our first midterm, majority of students missed a specific question. The professor went through the solution in the class after the midterm and explained the answer and told us that for corrections on that specific question we could receive full credit instead of half credit.","The professor allows us to submit question that we are still stuck on. She reviews the most commonly asked questions that next class period explaining what's important to remember","My instructor went over common mistakes in lecture. We also discuss common mistakes during discussion.","She often goes over questions that people have on lectures at the beginning of the class. She will talk about misconceptions that people may have about some topics which may lead to any common errors.","Each week, before the lecture, there is a small section where she will go through common mistakes. This is helpful for us to learn.","Dr. G always opens her lectures with common misconceptions students have been making in assignments and then corrects them. It is very helpful.","Every beginning of lecture, the first slide is about common questions and common misconceptions. She explains ay questions and clears up the misconceptions.","At the beginning of the lecture she explains common misconceptions that students asked in the content question assignment","Recently, Dr. [Removed] explained in class a common misconception that one might make about a particular physics problem. She told us watch out for it and made sure we understood the mistake.","When presenting an example problem in class, Dr. [Removed] will discuss helpful hints and potential mistakes one might make while completing the problem.","She picks the questions that we get the most wrong on our exam and will tell us so that we can go over them and understand them better.","When going through in class examples, she provides feedback on how to work the problem and how to approach it.","When working through an example, professor [Removed] will sometimes point out mistakes people make, like confusing linear and angular variables, and will explain why / what is not correct. She is also open to questions and uses any wrong answers given in class as a learning opportunity.","She talks through the errors student make after the test, but not prior to the test","Dr. [Removed] is understanding and encourages us to fix our mistakes ; in her homework, she gives out up to 7 attempts to get a question right ; that way, we have the opportunity to learn where we went wrong and how to get the answer right.","Tell us examples of zombie questions","He always asks students about how they approach problems. Even if their approach is wrong, he will still use it and point out areas that will not work out for the problem.","When Dr. [Removed] would go over square cap questions or examples, he would mention common mistakes students made when solving problems similar to the examples. Dr. [Removed] has also mentioned that students may leave homework and assignments for the last minute which would reflect poorly on their grades.","This happened after we too out first test. We went over questions we all commonly missed on the exam during our discussion period.","Based on the questions on the exam, the questions are the most missed questions on the homework, also the TA [Removed] has been really helpful in going through common errors.","He explained how truly knowing the concepts and how they apply to a question stops a student from making the mistake of just trying to poly many things into different equation which would water their time.","He was addressing some common mistakes people do on exams or when they work out certain kinematics problems.","When we review the squarecap problems in class, Dr. [Removed] points out processes that can be tricky and common misconceptions that can lead to the wrong answer. It's a really helpful process that can reorient my thinking about physics and improve in the future.","after the exam \n","Dr. perry talked about 2d motion and mentioned 2 tricky concepts that are very easy to mix.","This instructor always gave advice and if we needed help in a certain class they would refer certain private help. No matter how busy they were they will always make room to help you such as during orientation and class problems during exam times.","She helps us with strategies to be successful next time if we did not do good in an exam","She discussed with us about properly preparing for difficult exams and what mistakes to avoid. We discussed how long periods of studying without any breaks is actually more hurtful than helpful.","While we were discussing study habits, [Removed] explained how many students have a flawed study plan and cause themselves to stress or make mistakes on test day. She agrees the best way is to study early rather than pulling all nighters.","During the classroom instapoll, Dr. [Removed] will talk through the answers with us. When we are wrong, he prompts us to get a better answer and explains why.","Professor always goes through example problems in class and pinpoints where tricky areas to understand are","On the exam, professor [Removed] drew a diagram on the board when many people did not understand how to initially set up a problem in the exam. This happened prior to the exam.","Days after the exam are useful because of the amount of help that they give us in terms of going through issues we might have had in the exam.","Whenever going over problems or answering questions in class, Dr. [Removed] will mention common mistakes many people make. She'll often talk about why she thinks these mistakes occur as well as how to prevent them and avoid them.","She will take a formula and demonstrate common slip ups a student might make in an exam. For example, with kinematics she showed us how to look for the right formula to use, and how we would know if we were using the wrong formula.","After the exam, the teacher went through every question and allowed it to be a discussion if we still didn't understand it. She also asks us if anyone needs clarification after every practice problem.","On homework assignments, [Removed] goes over questions she believes we may struggle on because she reviews the questions herself. She'll explain the work process, mistakes we might make, and why it would be wrong","Common errors were gone over as soon as we got our test back, and she went step by step through each of the questions we had.   She makes herself and the TA very available for any questions to aid us in being very successful.","Almost every lecture, Dr. [Removed] goes through practice problems with us and shows us how we can make an error in our calculations and shows us the correct way.","He has talked to us about common mistakes or troubles that students find in other courses that they might be taking. He helps if we have any questions."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

It's a way for me to preview content before lectures, and continue to practice / correct my mistakes with the 3 allowed attempts.","She drops some of the lowest scoring quizzes and learning modules. On top of that, it is ok to fail 2 tests because there are retake opportunities at the end of the semester.","My instructor only allows you to fix your mistakes in the modules that we take before class. In other work like in class quizzes we have not been given the opportunity to correct those if needed. For exams she has said we will be able to fix two of our lowest exams towards the end of the semester. Other than that, we don't really have the opportunity to redo much if we needed to.","We have multiple learning modules a week. In these modules you can resubmit the assignment 3 times to get a better grade.","I believe professor caudill allows for makeup replacement exams, but I'm not sur rif you can resubmit regular assignment","On all of the learning modules that are due before class, I am able to submit multiple times to get a better grade.","Professor [Removed] had reminded us at the beginning in the Unit 2 that we would have the opportunity to retake two if our exams, but advised us to not retake Unit 2 if we can help it.","Every few days we receive a homework assignment called a Learning Module, with questions based on the reading provided. For each Learning Module, you get three attempts to gain full credit. For both wrong and right answers you often get explanations of the steps to achieve the correct answer.","On the syllabus and in class Professor [Removed] gives students the oppurtunity to retake two exams out of the four. It gives people time to look over all their notes and be able to feel less stress within the class because if you do bad on one exam it doesn't feel like the worlds over and like your grade won't recover.","Offered a variety of TA and office hours to learn from mistakes on tests and think through the problems, while sleeking advice from previous year's students who took the course","This is in regards to the review of the syllabus. The professor reviewed how they would allow for the final exam to replace 2 different tests that were taken earlier in the year. The FE we would take would be over that material and would allow us to show improvement of mastering the material in the form of retesting","For learning modules, my instructor allows infinite attempts on these modules up until the time of our Unit exam. Therefore, if we do not perform well we can resubmit several times for a better grade before the time of our exam.","Dr. [Removed] talked about improving our grades and learning from our mistakes after our first exam. She talked about how we could re - take exams to replace our original grade.","We have modules that we are required to complete each week, many people in the class weren't completing them due to the misunderstanding of they weren't required. Our instructor extended the deadline for a few models which allowed us to complete them and increase our overall grade.","n / a","We are able to resubmit learning modules for a total of three attempts. Also, when we took our first exam, Dr. [Removed] mentioned that instead of a final exam, we would have the opportunity to retake previous exams for better scores.","Dr. [Removed] allows for extra attempts on learning modules assigned.","we are able to retake two of our lowest test grades for the final exam \n","The instructor on our modules allow us up to three tries so if we didn't do great on the first attempt. We would have two more tries to do them and she would keep the highest grade.","We're allowed to resubmit our learning modules.","For learning modules ( homework ) dr [Removed] allows us to resubmit the module three times for full credit.","She has an amazing policy that allows you to retake exams. This provides more opportunity to go over the topics you were unsure of or failed.","On the learning modules, we can submit up to 3 times allowing us to fix our mistakes and improve the grade. This gives us an opportunity to see what we don't understand, go back and learn it, and then fix our mistakes to make sure we understand it.","Every quizes that she gives us always has at least 3 attempts to do so we will have some opportunities to correct our wrong answers","You can retake modules up to three times which is helpful to fully understand what your learning, and you can retake one test.","Our classroom can be compared to a flipper classroom in the sense that we have learning modules to complete prior to class. We have unlimited attempts to complete these, so if need be, we are able to go back and enter the correct answer.","[Removed] allows for 2 retakes on 2 exams and i think this in iteself shows that she is willing to give her students second chances because she knows her students can come back from their mistakes on asisgnments and have another go at improving their grade.","We are allotted two replacement exams","We can take replacement exams to change exam grades if we did bad at first","Each learning module gives 3 attempts to allow students to learn from their mistakes.","We are given three attempts at each learning module","Made opportunities to revise our work and improve our understanding of the material.","You get 3 tries on the module","She lets us do retests later in the semester to learn from our mistakes","She helps us by allowing us to review with our fellow peers.","All of our hw assignments allow 3 attempts. There is homework for every class and it's assigned a couple of days before it's due. [Removed] says that it's important to understand the material, so the attempts are there to give students chances to completely understand a topic instead of giving up after they get it wrong.","Before class started the professor made sure that we knew that there was re take quizzes available for us if we wanted to improve our scores. It was rather brief, I can't remember if she made a post on canvas or not","At the beginning of class, she tells us to look at the syllabus for information on the replacement exams and the upcoming extra credit opportunities. After every test and typically about 2 - 3 weeks, she reminds us that we still have these opportunities to learn and grow from up to two tests that we could improve upon.","At the end of the semester, we are allowed to retake two exams to attempt to earn a better grade.","We have multiple attempts on learning modules.","For our learning modules, you get 3 attempts to complete it. So if you make a mistake and don't like your grade you have chances to improve it and the highest score is taken.","The module learning system always students to submit up to three attempts and is accessible up until the exam. This helped with extra practice and check understanding.","The chemistry modules used to help us study have 3 attempts allowed and we are able to retake until we are happy with our grade.","This applies specifically to the learning modules. We have 3 opportunities to submit the assignment if any corrections are needed. Dr. [Removed] encourages us to take them as many times as possible to get the best possible grade.","We can resubmit learning modules and replace two of our lowest exam scores at the end of the semester.","After the unit test, the instructor let us know we had the option to retake the unit test at the end of the semester if we were unhappy with our grade.","We can redo tests in the class at the end of the semester. If we do bad on a test we can review the test, see our mistakes, and redo the test later to improve our grade.","The instructor allows for us to have 3 attempts on our modules. I believe this is important because learning the material on the first attempt doesn't really happen too often. Through this method, we are still able to learn and have multiple opportunities to achieve the highest grade possible.","We have weekly learning modules where we cover the content of the week. With these modules, we can learn from our mistakes by after submitting, we get to see an explanation on why our incorrect answers were wrong. Our professor allows two other tries on the exam, which allows us to correct answers and get a better score on the other attempts.","In this course they allow us to retake an exam we didn't do well on. This happens after the fact of the exam.","Every time we have a quiz, the questions on the quiz and explanations are made available to us so that we can know why we got a question wrong. This is really helpful for preparing for the tests. We are also able to redo the Learning Modules in order to better understand concepts.","In her weekly Learning Modules, she gives us multiple attempts to go through it, and allows us to look at what questions we got wrong in between attempts. She also has make up tests at the end of year that students can choose to take if they scored badly on one of the previous exams during the year in order to try and get their grade up.","Small assignments are re - takeable. Weekly quizzes are like mini exams and a practice exam is released before the actual exam to prepare. Retakes for the unit exams also are available at the end of the course.","For our learning modules, we have up to 3 attempts to score the highest we can. It allows us to learn from mistakes and try again while still learning.","At the end of the semester she allows us to retake two exams to show we have learned","Our learning modules, which are essentially pre - knowledge quizzes have 3 attempts. We also have multiple attempts on most practice assignments leading up to the exam, which allows for learning.","We typically have two asynchronous modules a week that include quiz - like questions. [Removed] gives us three attempts at the module, in case a mistake was made in the first couple of tries.","The instructor allows students to retake exams that they may not have done well on.","Dr. [Removed] gives students three attempts on the Learning Modules. She also allows us to redo some of our exams.","My teacher allows us to retake the question modules quizzes if we feel that we did not perform up to our standards. We are allowed three retries to really drill in the material.","In the Learning Modules, you are allowed three attempts. The questions stay the same, so you can try again in whatever you got wrong. \n","In [Removed] 301, Dr. [Removed] allowed students to correct their mistakes on a challenging exam problem and resubmit their work for partial credit. She emphasized, \" This is a chance for you to learn from your errors and reinforce the concepts, \" encouraging students to engage deeply with the material. This opportunity occurred after the first midterm and provided students with valuable feedback and the chance to improve their grade through reflection and revision.","In our chemistry class, after completing a challenging learning module on thermodynamics, the instructor allowed us to redo the module to improve our understanding and grade. This happened midway through the semester, with the instructor emphasizing, “ Use this opportunity to learn from your mistakes and strengthen your grasp of the material. ” This policy made the learning process more flexible and supportive.","We are allowed to retake up to two of the exams at the end of the semester, but the professor still makes it known that is an expectation that we will do well on the tests so that we won't have to make them up","I know that there are late grades, which is better then a zero, and there is extra credit to help improve the grade average for her class.","In our learning modules, our professor gives us multiple attempts at each module to answer the questions over the material. If we get some wrong, we still have an opportunity to retake the quiz and answer all the questions correctly and get full credit. This is helpful because it relieves some pressure from wanting to get everything correct on the first attempt. Giving us three attempts allows us to fail but still be able to get full credit.","Dr. [Removed] has provided students with chances to redo learning modules, and take the best of the many which allows us to not feel bad if the grade is bad. This has also happened with quizzes and exams.","We have learning modules to complete before every class. These modules have everything from the material that you need to prepare for the test and chem 302. Each module has 3 attempts, allowing you to almost always recieve full credit for them. There is also one exam retake which I will be using to improve my grade to what I want it to be.","She put it explicitly on the syllabus and tells us after each exam that if we didn't do the best on it, we can retake up to 2 midterms. Additionally, in the thermodynamics unit, she told us to pay close attention to the signs since that is something that students mix up often","we have learning modules that have three attempts. These are due before each class and if a question is answered wrong, it usually has an excerpt explaining why it is wrong.","You can makeup one of the tests for a better grade and three quizzes get dropped. This was made clear in the first lecture and on the syllabus.","The teacher allows students to take two make up replacement tests at the end of the year.","She allows us to take the learning modules up to three times, and she has curved the unit 1 exam. She also has provided different kinds of extra credit.","I know it happened, I just don't know when exactly.","Dr. [Removed] offers test retakes for exams that we do poorly on. This allows us to learn from our mistakes and retake an exam.","On each learning module the student receives 3 attempts. This gives students the opportunity to go back and learn from their mistakes as well as improve their grades.","So we were told we can redo one exam at the end of the semester and the higher grade of the two will be used to replace the lower grade.","The instructor would give us chances to make up, ( take the highest 5 quiz grades ) and this happened from the beginning of the semester. The instructor said this during it happened.","Dr. [Removed] does reveal which questions a student has gotten wrong on the weekly quizzes.","Re - attempting learning modules ( canvas pages that preview the next class's content ) such that you can go back and try again at problems missed 3 times, with the highest score always being taken.","After the exam she made it clear that mistakes were learning experiences. She thought it was good regardless.","Our canvas Modules allow for 3 attempts so it is a relief to not stress as much about getting a perfect score on the first try but rather trying to truly understand the material. This way, if my understanding is not up to par and I make a mistake I feel better about learning from it because I am not penalized by grade.","In the learning modules of the course, we have three times to answer all the questions. Thus, we are able to learn from our mistakes and get full marks.","We are allowed to retake one Unit Exam.","She would allow us to see our answers on canvas. We have 3 tries on the homework / learning modules.","Allow to retake midterms. At end of semester.","The instructor provides us with graded learning modules online. Whenever we complete these, we have the opportunity to re - complete them if we missed any questions.","All of the learning modules have 3 attempts and you can see what u got wrong as well as an explanation.","During our learning modules we get 3 attempts each time to improve our grade ensuring we can learn and improve our grade. Also there is no final for this class and instead allows for a retake of unit tests that we may have struggled on","My instructor has allowed for multiple attempts on our learning module assignments. If I get certain questions wrong, I can retry the learning module to try to earn a better grade.","Our instructor assigns something called learning modules, which are assignments that go over content or introduces content through questions. You actually have 3 attempts for the learning modules and the highest grade is counted. from this, us students are able to learn from our mistakes ( it doesn't tell you which answe is correct, you need to figure it out yourself ) and it even improves our grades.","Dr. [Removed] allows retakes on exams as a final exam. She has repeatedly stated this over the course of the semester, and she ensures that students are not over stressing for the course.","The instructor gives students 3 tried for the homework and up to 2 retakes for the exams. The instructor provides feedback and correct answers for the exams when it's graded.","Our instructor allows us to resubmit learning modules to make sure that we fully understand the material before we even get to class. We have three attempts and we get a learning module before every class.","For every module we have 3 attempts. We can learn from our mistakes in ansering the questions [Removed] retry for a better grade. I find this extremly helpful becuase I am not stressing on the grade the first time around and am there just to learn. I love this aspect of the modules as it gives me a senese of reassurance that I am allowed to make mistakes and not be penalized.","She allows three attempts on each homework assignment in order to let her students learn from their first two attempts.","We can redo some exams that we had messed up originally. It is in the syllabus.","The instructor gives the students multiple chances to resubmit our work for a better grade.","This happens in the course when your allowed to retake two exams out of the four in the class that you might not have done well on.","In our learning modules we are able to correct our mistakes which I appreciate.","This happens when we turn in learning modules.

She also allows multiple attempts for the homeworks.","With our Learning Modules, we have unlimited access and multiple attempts to learn from our mistakes and improve our grades. This lets us actually learn the content while still testing us on it!","We are given 3 attempts on our learning modules, and explanations are often provided for why incorrect answers are wrong.","At the end of the semester we are granted retests where we can retake a test that we have not done so good on in the past for up to full credit.","The learning modules have 3 attempts, so you can raise your grade if you do not do well.","Within her structure of canvas, she allows for us to have makeup credit for the learning modules if not made up in time. We are also given multiple chances.","In the course, the instructor allowed students to revise and resubmit their assignments if they didn't perform well initially. This typically happened after receiving feedback on a quiz, where the instructor would say, “ I encourage you to take this feedback as an opportunity to learn and improve your work. You can resubmit for a chance to raise your grade. ”","All our learning modules have multiple submissions so we can learn from our mistakes. Also, we can retake 2 exams during the final period.","This is for our learning modules. She allows 3 attempts for each module we do. So 6 - 7 modules a week. She has also said that it is ok to make mistakes. She even shows the quiz answers and explains it on the resources.

This will allow us to learn from our mistakes because most of the midterms and exams in chemistry are formatted similarly.","Allows up to 3 retakes on all Learning Module assignments.","Gave the students the opportunity to redo the modules that she assigns 3 times. Happens every time.","We have three attempts when we do our learning modules. Learning modules are due before lecture, so most students will complete them at least the night before. After each attempt, we are able to see which questions we got wrong, but it will not tell us the right answer until after the last attempt. That way, we have a chance to learn what went wrong and work our way towards the right answer.","This happens in the learning modules where we can retake the module for full credit.","The professor lets us review our work and what we do wrong, however, they do not allow us to resubmit work.","We get multiple chances to correct our lab photo submits with minor reductions.","When the bacteria dilutions in my group were not usable the instructor allowed us to redo the dilutions and we eventually were able to catch up with the rest of the class.","In my lab course, the instructor allowed us to improve our work by providing detailed, constructive feedback on the lab photos we submitted after each lab session. This happened consistently throughout each week, allowing us to alter our photos after making the suggested improvements. The instructor often wrote, \" Use these comments to enhance your work and resubmit for a higher grade, \" encouraging us to learn from our mistakes and refine our submissions for better results.","For our quizzes, our instructor gives us the option to go over our quiz and request a resubmit if we feel like we are right in order to improve our grade.","On all lab reports we submit she offers constructive feedback as to improve the quality of the report. Also in lab she allows quiz makeups","I haven't encountered this yet.","In this course, after receiving feedback on an assignment, we were given the opportunity to revise and resubmit our work to improve our grade. This happened at the beginning of the semester, when we submitted our first round of lab reports. The instructor encouraged us by saying, “ Mistakes are part of learning ; if you revise your report based on my feedback, you can resubmit for a higher grade, ” which emphasized the value of improving through constructive criticism.","During lab instructor is forgiving of mistakes and helps us through them. Has a good hands on approach that allows for learning through trial and error.","It hasn't happened","For the lab photos, he gave comments on what we could do to get a better grade before going through and grading them.","There has not been a specific time where students have been able to resubmit an assignment because of a mistake but there was one instance last week when [Removed] took 1 performance point off for 3 out of the 4 lab groups. She did this because all of the groups picked and patched from the center of their colonies rather than the outside. The next lab after she took point off she discussed with the class that she was going to give us 0.5 points back for performance because she found out that it was never mentioned in any of out pre - lab or course material to pick from the outside of colonies.","during our master plate sampling sawyer noticed that we were taking our samples from the center of the colonies instead of from the edges. When she saw this she was quick to correct it and asked us if we watched the pre - lab videos. At that point, it was mostly too late to correct us because we had already made the master plates. Then on Thursday, a lot of the master plates turned out poorly due to this mistake and she let us redo the master plates. She also gave back 5 points to our grade because she realized the pre [Removed] labs did not specify to sample from the edge, but she was sure she had mentioned it in class.","When I accidentally got the toothpicks in a way that was not practicing aseptic technique she allowed me to think about what and or why I was doing it wrong. maybe around September 20th","This course does not really allow resubmissions. However, this course, and my TA does emphasize where students have made mistakes in the past and to be careful. Another thing that is emphasized by the TA is that it is ok to make mistakes. Part of science experiments and making discoveries is learning as you go, and that includes making mistakes. Making mistakes can be good. Another thing she stresses, is to be on top of studying, especially for quizzes.","This hasn't happened and is not allowed according to the syllabus","I don't remember anytime she did tbh","Dr. [Removed] lets us resubmit our [Removed] answers at the end of the class if we got anything wrong. I really appreciate this policy of hers, it doesn't make me feel extremely anxious each time I answer a question, scared to get it wrong.","My teacher always reopens our daily poll questions at the end of the class so that we can resubmit the assignment if there are incorrect answers. Additionally, our quizzes have 2 attempts for us to use so that we can learn from our mistakes and resubmit for a higher score.","Dr. [Removed] makes a big effort to allow one to learn from their mistakes and gives additional time to complete assignments as a result.","Every week we have a quiz that we have the opportunity to resubmit. We ca take the quiz once, learn from any mistakes made, and then retake the quiz again for a better score.","She lets us get two attempts on our quizzes.","We have unlimited attempts for homework submissions along with two attempts for our quizzes. This goes for every homework and quiz. This is written in many emails and in the syllabus for our use and knowledge.","We get to resubmit one assignment during the term and get to have two attempts on the quizzes that are take home to learn from mistakes and not be penalized for it.","There is a grace period on assignments and imo pretty sure you can resubmit for a better grade","We are able to take multiple attempts on quizzes, as well as ask questions before submitting assignments to ensure we do it right.","She allows us to resubmit our quizzes one time to improve our grade","The instructor allows us to have two attempts on our quizzes, 6 hours apart. So if we make a mistake on the first quiz, we are able to reflect and learn to try again on different problems in the next quiz.","While direct resubmission is not prevalent in this class, chances to improve and growth is veryu welll cultivated. For instance, the lowest midterm is dropped, homework are not graded based on correctness or incorrectness, and you have the option to retake quizzes.","The homeworks are graded for completion and not accuracy. She posts the key later on where we can access and correct our work","She allows us to resubmit the homework assignments and gives us a 24 hour grace period for them as well.","The professor allows two attempts on weekly quizzes and takes the better score of these quizzes.","We can learn from our grade and look at keys to understand what we did wrong.","The weekly homework assignments we have are mainly based on completion, and an answer key is released after the due date has passed by. This is a way to emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes without being harshly penalized.","She allows for resubmissions and provides feedback on our work.","She allows us to have two attempts on the quiz, but only after a certain period of time, in which I use to review the materials and topics I missed.","She opens up the instapoll questions back after the class ends for few minutes, so we can fix the answer and get full credit. She emphasizes the importance of participation in class and learning from our mistakes, and I was able to more focus during class and understand the concept better.","On quizzes two attempts are given to learn from mistakes which is great for understanding the content.","This is expressed on the syllabus, but students have two opportunities to resubmit their homework for a better grade. Moreover, homeworks are graded based on completion of answering the question and providing a clear train of thought, allowing students to be free to make mistakes, then check back to clarify errors and doubts.","On weekly quizzes, Dr. [Removed] provides us with two attempts with the only requirement being that we wait at least six hours before the second attempt. This allows us time to reflect on our mistakes before rushing into a second attempt. Since the highest quiz score is kept, it gives us encouragement to not give up.","Students get to see what mistakes they made on test, and go ever results with Dr. [Removed] or TAs.","We can review our exams with the TAs which allows us to check if we can receive partial credit for certain problems.","She gave me an extension but not resubmit.","Throughout the semester, we can resubmit one homework assignment. I learned about this from my TA during a recent discussion section.","The instructor allows two attempts for each quiz so students can show they learned from previous mistakes.","She allows two tries on quizzes and homework resubmissions, along with drops.","Dr. [Removed] lets students resubmit their homework assignments after grades and feedback has been released in 24 hours.","Students can learn from their mistakes on quizzes each week by taking one attempt and looking at which answers were wrong. When the quizzes would open back up 6 hours later -- time given to reflect on those wrong answers, a student would be able retake the quiz for one more attempt.","The instructor was very helpful in teaching me a problem. This happened last week. He said to take a different approach to things.","There are no resubmission work to improve grades.","He let us do a retake exam after midterm 2 in order to show we learned from our mistakes and get 1/2 credit back on the actual exam, which not only helped our grades, but our understanding.","Yes he allowed us to retake a mini exam in order to improve our exam 2 grade.","The professor allowed us to retake the midterm for half credit back","The homework application we use allows you to submit two attempts to each question without any loss of points. If it takes more than two attempts, you can still earn points just less amounts every time after. It makes homework less scary and we're able to make natural mistakes in our learning.","I have not personally resubmitted anything thanks to the professor but I thought I heard from someone else that he could help in that way","In the Homework for each week, there is an option to, and we are allowed to submit numerous answers if answered wrongly for each question.","This is available on [Removed] homeworks.","They didn't \n","We were allowed to retest our second midterm.","He allowed us to make up half points back on our exam 2 since we mostly did poorly","we took a retest for our past exam to correct our mistakes","Credit back","the past exam average was about a 50 - 60 % so he allowed us to take a retake with half the number of questions.   he had different questions but it was an in class collaboration effort to get back some credit and very beneficial","We just took an exam. We have been given the opportunity to earn back credit next wedenesday. He said that we should use this as a learning experience and keep a growth mindset.","the class average was really bad for the last midterm, so he let us do a retake and we got to earn back half the points that we initially lost","Exam 2 average score was below a passing score therefore they allowed to take a make up exam to try and increase this result.","When we have discussion worksheets, both our professor and TAs are good about giving grace.

There is virtually no curve though.","For some assignments, our TA will correct us on simple mistakes.","In the course we listen to lectures and do square cap. This is during each class time, coming to class is very important because lectures move by day.","After the first exam, Dr. [Removed] allowed students to submit an assignment in which one had to go over their mistakes in the past exam and analyze why they got those questions wrong. These were made to evaluate weak points and thus be able to prepare better for the next exam by seeing what you could improve on in the study process.","Students could retake the first exam if they accidentally interfered with the lock down browser. He allowed the retake for the first exam but assured us that there will be no more test retakes.","Yes he allows test corrections","For exam 1, Dr. [Removed] offered an exam correction analysis form.

She wrote questions that could help bolster our knowledge.","We are allowed to resubmit assignments, but I'm not sure if this is only before the due date.","There are multiple attempt allowed on pre - lab assignments and you can submit your homework as many as you want before the deadline, which allow you to change answers after learning the correct way to do the problem.","For our project, many people got negative grades on their proposal assignment where they outlined their ideas and methods. I can't remember why exactly, but I think it was because their proposal would not end up working with the future assignments / instructions. Professor [Removed] told these students to meet with her so they can fix their proposals and resubmit for proper grading.","I don't believe we got to resubmit work","We are allowed to submit a regrade request for our assignments.","I don't think we have opportunities for regrades but we do go over common mistakes on quizzes. I wish we went over the homework more since we don't talk about it in class.","Professor [Removed] has done this once this semester and it was when we submitted our project proposal. I think it is a good idea since it forces students to look at what they did wrong and fix it before their grade is changed.","For written assignment the professor provided feedback. Feedback is still being provided for the groups that need it.","Actually not too sure she's done this but the TAs have been super sweet and understanding that I'm sure with enough evidence of work being done to correct mistakes some credit would be earned back.","After exams, I know that professor requests students to come to office hours. We also run through most missed questions in discussions. However, I am unsure if she allows students to resubmit work to improve their grade. I have been performing well on exams so this is not an issue that applies to me.","She gave us time to work on your draft for an ecology note in discussion submit it and continue bettering it before the final submission","Instapolls","we actually aren't able to do this, i accidentally selected it","When it came to ecology note 1, we were able to ask for help / get a better idea / understanding if we did a piece of it wrong. This happened earlier on in the semester","The teacher allows us to retake exams if we don't feel confident in our grade.","Allows retake tests and multiple attempts on homework problems","The professor mentions several times how we are allowed to retake the exams. We should learn from our mistakes from the first one to do better on the second test.

Instructor was very big on learning from mistakes and to study from them","Allows us on hws chances to fix it and to take and can again","We went over mistakes made during the exam. We also went over important misconceptions students commonly have.","We are able to retake exams which is extremely important in learning and truly understanding the material, as Dr. [Removed] reiterates. This is something we can do after every exam.","She allows retake exams for each to improve our grade if we do better on the retake. This allows us to go back and improve our understanding, and she encourages people to take the retake.","The teacher allows us to have 2 attempt at tests and our HW is inline and lets you try again if you get something wrong.","we have test retakes. and on homework we have 2 chances to get full credit.","We are able to retake our test to show our improvement.","He allows us to retake exams with different questions for full credit.","He offers make up exams for every exam so if you feel bad about your exam you can take the retake.","Our instructor has allowed us to improve upon our mistakes by creating a system that allows for retests on each exam. Moreover, our instructor drops a couple of the homework assignments along the way to foster an environment of learning.","Dr. [Removed] gives opportunities to retake every exam in the course for full credit back.","The instructor allows students to retake every exam regardless of the original score in order to improve their grade.","He gives us the opportunity to retake our exams and gives an additional week before the retake. Lets us keep our exams and work only takes the scantrons. it doesn't get any better than that.","Students are allowed to retake an exam a week after the initial exam to try and get a better grade. In addition instapolls are taken during class where the professor will provide insight based common wrong answers and allow students to correct their answer.","For midterm exams we can retake another one with different questions but similar topics, then the one with the highest grade get counted.","I'm not sure","He lets us submit corrections for our midterms after we take them","Dr. [Removed] allow us to get half of our missed points in the exam if we could make a redo.","He allows us to get credit back on tests","We are allowed to make test corrections and submit them for extra credit. We can also have open discussions within the square cap sessions.","Questions on out assignments have multiple submission attempts so we can keep trying to earn at least some credit from these questions.","He allows midterms to be resubmitted for half credit back. This was said over and over again in class and is on the syllabus.","The professor lets us redo questions we got wrong on the exam for half credit back","In this course, after each exam, the instructor allows us to redo our exam for up to half the points back. To earn the additional points, we have to explain our mistakes and correct them in a resubmission. After our first exam in [Removed] 4, the instructor explained, “ This is an opportunity for you to learn from your mistakes — identify where you went wrong, explain your reasoning, and improve your understanding. ” This method not only helps us improve our grades but also reinforces our grasp of the material.","We can do test corrections for credit back on our examinations.","For each of our Exams we are given corrections to get half points back on each question we missed he first time, and we are given the whole time period until the next exam to submit these corrections.","Homework for this class is done using [Removed] TA. In this system, students are able to submit their final answer, but if the answer is wrong, we are able to reevaluate and resubmit a different answer. The site even offers hints and feedback.","The day after I took my midterm on 9/27, Dr. [Removed] let us redo the problems we missed in the midterms for half credit back. He allowed us to make mistakes the first time without penalty in homework problems. He also gave us tips on completing the problems that we struggled with.","Throughout the course so far, homework has been very forgiving and easy to get a high grade on, although it can be time - consuming. On exams, we have the opportunity to redo problems for half credit. Given that this course can be conceptually confusing, I greatly appreciate this.","I believe I've heard that you can resubmit homework to obtain additional points, but I'm not sure if I misheard. It's a bit hazy to see that from the course syllabus, as it's mentioned that practice is graded on correctness with several attempts, but I need to just outright ask soon so that I can take full advantage of this incentivized learning opportunity.","On midterms, we are allowed to earn half points back after corrections.","Whenever we miss class or a prefecture assignment, we can do a \" [Removed] Review \" assignment for participation credit that we had missed. Also test corrections for 1/2 credit back","After the midterm we can submit a set of corrections for point which allows us to review work and benefit from it.","I referred to Dr. [Removed] allowing us to submit test corrections after our exams were returned. It still hasn't technically happened but it will this coming week.","Dr. [Removed] allows you to resubmit your midterm for 1/2 credit back on each question. This is really helpful as you are able to correct your mistakes and be rewarded for truly internalizing the material after the second attempt.","We get the opportunity to redo some problems on the midterm and resubmit for extra points. This helps us learn what we did wrong at first and even get a better grade for doing so.","In our biology course, the instructor allowed us to review feedback and resubmit certain assignments to improve our grades. After initial grading, we were encouraged to revise our work based on the comments and correct any misunderstandings.","I can't remember a specific moment.","[Removed] homeworks allow us one free try for each question before points are docked off and future midterms have zombie questions which allow us to get points back from previous mistakes","Dr. [Removed] allows homeworks assignments to be dropped, which is a tremendous help when struggling to catch up in terms of content.","[Removed] instructor said that students should learn from other mistakes, but don't dwell on them. You take this experience and you move forth and do better next time.","Just today we had an assignment due last week and some people submitted it but it was incomplete. So she extended the deadline for us to re submit it correctly and completely and she explained exactly what we needed to do","If we do better on a midterm than a quiz, our quiz grade is replaced by the midterm grade","We do assignments on quest which allows us multiple attempts to learn when we get something wrong and work to fix it to get the correct answer. This really helps instead of just getting something wrong and getting a 0.","Dr. [Removed] has the weekly quest homework set up so that your first guess will not count against you. This allows students to get help if they miss the question the first time.","I read that question and immediately thought of two things Dr. [Removed] does for us. In the homeworks she gives us a freebie for each question, so if you get it right on the 2nd attempt you still get full points. I also thought of the exam retakes. Yes they are not the exact same and the retake is slighly harder but, it still gives an opportunity to improve one's self.","Our instructor allowed us to fix our presentations.","This may be a technicality, but [Removed] allows students to resubmit answers to questions without taking off points until the third submission. The professor explained this process to students during the first portion of the term.","He provided a makeup exam for every exam. Dr. [Removed] explained how exams should be seen as learning opportunities, rather than detriments to our academic career.","TAs allowed us to resubmit assignments based on the comments left on the assignment and regraded it for understanding.

She also told us at the beginning of the school year all the opportunities we have for extra credit and redoing exams.","Offered extra credit opportunities","The instructor informed us that there was a research survey to be posted on [Removed]. She said that upon completing the survey, we'd receive extra credit for our grade.","I think just that the instructor provides the opportunity to retake unit exams later on in the semester. This allows students to get a better grade and also show that they have learned from their mistakes.","The syllabus states that students gave the opportunity to make up two exams for full credit back.

Furthermore, she understood that people do not always feel extremely confident on certain exams, hence, the ability to re - take them.","I would say that this is not exactly the way it happens. However, [Removed] [Removed] is a very fair grader when it comes to exams as when it becomes apparent that something wasn't understood by a majority of students or there was a mistake within the exam she corrects it.","Students are allowed to take multiple attempts on learning modules and can do replacement exams.","This has not occurred in the course yet, but in this course we do not have a final.

I think that this is a pretty efficient model, because extra credit is based on participation and not academic ability.

She said there are still plenty of chances to change our grades by taking the makeup exam at the end of the semester ( which would replace our lowest exam ).","She would allow students to see their tests and would explain difficult questions.

The procedures are usually one - and - done. You get two tries - one with something like E coli and one with your actual bacteria. It's a bit hard to learn and practice outside of those times.","Often times we can redo the quizzes 6 hours after taking it, to help reinforce the ideas we missed.","It was outlined early in the syllabus what we could do to raise our grades following a midterm.

The analysis is not very time - consuming and just helps you see what you should work on next time.","Actually he provides extra credits by homework credit, square cap credit, discussion section credit, survey credit, and etc. It helps us to improve our grade and les concern about the mistakes.","For the last test we could do test corrections. Also doing this survey we can earn extra points.","we are able to do an analyzes that will give us 5 extra points or even the responds quiz that gave us 3 points","After Exam one, he assigned an Exam analysis that allows you to go through your answers, figure out what you got wrong, and why. When we turn in the assignment, we get 5 extra credit points on the exam.","We get our lowest test dropped and replaced by the score of our final, so there is still some room for improvement after taking all our exams.","Dr. [Removed] has always talked about extra credit for his students especially for the big exams we have to take.","On the first exam, filling out a worksheet describing what questions you got wrong and why would add points to your overall course point score essentially giving you points back.","I have no earned any credit back for my first midterm. I did a self analysis sheet and understood what I messed up on. There are no opportunities for this.","The assessment form we will out after tests gives us an opportunity to figure out what study habits were beneficial and what else we need to work on going forward. He also allows us to replace our lowest exam score with the final exam at the end of the semester.","Dr. [Removed] provides many opportunities throughout the semester to get extra credit for exams through surveys and etc. This usually occurs right before or after an exam/ midterm.","I don't remember an exact time but I do remember him going over problems after the exam to see what we messed up on. He also provided extra   points.","Throughout the course, Dr. [Removed] often will give us extra credit opportunities. For example, completing surveys, practice exams, and other items get us extra credit.","He gives us extra credit for completing an analysis of what we missed. I am super grateful for this because it helps me to understand the REASON I got questions wrong.","There's a lot of extra credit and we can talk to the TA if we thought the questions were unfair on the exam.","Everyday","N / A","No exams in class","So far mentioned that the TAs are approachable for credit questions and can provide insights to grading rubrics.","I have not experienced a moment like this.","The professor gives us opportunities to dispute our grades on [Removed]. And the TA's are very helpful too!","This survey for example is extra credit","The instructor often includes small extra credit assignments to get some points back.","We are allowed to submit assignments late and go to office hours to get help and improve our work.","N / A","I am not sure, but I know a regrade request is available.","We get the opportunity for regrade requests if we feel like a question was graded unfairly. We also get extra credit for completing surveys.","This is our extra credit for our quiz we just took. But, going to office hours we are able to go over our mistakes.","hasn't happened yet","There are many office hours and times to ask questions from the teacher and teaching team to do regrade requests.","I'm not particularly sure that it allows us to learn from our mistakes, but we are able to get extra credit for submitting surveys. It might be beneficial for future classes to rework the missed quiz problems as a way of learning!","We have regrades and can complete extra credit surveys","     There's no credit given back on exams / quizzes.","While we do not get the opportunity to do exam corrections, we're given many extra credit opportunities to earn back points previously missed out on.","This survey is a good example. We get points for it","Wait this did not happen.","The professor allows students to go as far as retake an entire exam ( with different questions and online ). This happens shortly after the initial test, giving students the opportunity to see their initial final grade, as well as the points that they had made mistakes with. This gave opportunity to learn from the mistakes, see the consequences of making said mistakes, and improve on them. This provides a full circle of encouraging students to prepare more before the next test since they've seen the actions of the first, and promotes an encouraging workspace.","Teacher allows for a retake exam exactly 1 week after each midterm. The retake exam will replace the grade if you score higher.","The professor allows retake exams for all three midterm exams. She also puts questions from the initial take of the exam on the retake, to allow students to reflect on those and get credit back for those. on the retake.","The professor allows us to retake our exams if we are not happy with our original exam score. This happened during exam 1 and I took advantage of the opportunity to retake the exam.","Dr. [Removed] allows us to retake exams.","She gives us retakes up to 100 which helps us slot","The surveys and quizzes are an extra boost. \n","Retake tests the week after every test","We have retakes after every midterm exam to redeem ourselves","She gives us the opportunity to retake every exam and tells us that we will do better because we have learned from our mistakes. She takes whichever of the two exam scores are higher, but usually the second exam is higher.","I had accidentally submitted an answer with the wrong sign and I showed the professor that I understood the problem and was able to earn credit back","My professor gives us multiple opportunities to fill out surveys for extra credit and she also allows us to retake our exams so that we can study the material more and better understand what we are working on.","Provides a retake exam the week after exams. Pulls some questions from the first time.","Dr. [Removed] provides students with the opportunity to retake exams and gives our initial exams back for review and makes herself and her TA's available in between receiving the grade back from the initial exam and taking the retake.","She'll allow us to take a retake exam in case we weren't happy with our grade or just needed a retake because of other things that may have happened to us during an exam week.","She allows us to retake exams and will give us the first one back so we can see what we missed and try to correct it.","He will regularly let [Removed] questions run for a long time and give hints as to what the answer is. It feels a bit too easy at times ; however, it is nice for the times I don't understand. Additionally, he also allows a retest to anyone no matter their score on a test.","The professor stated there would be no exam drop but a retest a week after the initial exam. He had stated this at the beginning of the semester when going over the syllabus.","Instructor offers retest of midterm. Takes place one week after and takes higher of two.","[Removed] gives a \" re - test \" a week after every midterm that anyone can take if they want to try to improve their grade. It's a different test, but goes over similar material so it gives us an opportunity to improve.","The professor has optional exam re - takes a week after the original exam. There is no penalty for taking this option. This allows us to learn from our mistakes ( we get the original exam back before the new one ), and improve.","The instructor offered a re - exam a week after every exam to give students a chance to freshen up on topics they didn't do well on the first time.","He offers a retake exam with similar problems to reinforce the concepts we didn't do as well on the first time.","We can make up half points on exams by explaining the correct way to answer the question, not just by giving the correct answer a second time. We can also ask for help from TA's or Dr. [Removed] himself to work through this process.","The syllabus states that we have to opportunity to correct exams. After the first exam, Dr. [Removed] discussed this process.","This is what this course excells in. Every test we are able to earn back credit on exams by doing test corrections for half credit earned back. For example an 80 can become a 90 with thorough exemplification of test corrections. This happens any time between the midterm taken and the next midterm.","We just took our first midterm last week on [Removed], and after we got our results back on Friday ; he went over how we can earn credit back using the [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] system to earn half of the credit back from the exam.","Before the exam, he said that we could resubmit the exams for half credit if we were to show our work through the formulated steps he provided.","After each of the three midterm exams, Dr. [Removed] allows students to earn back half credit for the questions that were incorrect. This can be done by the student individually, or it can be done during an appointment with either Dr. [Removed] or one of the teaching assistants.","We get to do test corrections for credit back and to learn what we did wrong.","We just had our first exam, and he is allowing us to correct the problems we got wrong for half credit back, which I think is very forgiving of him.","The work throughs post exam allows for one to improve their test grades. More extra credit would be much appreciated though.","He allows us to redo and show our work for missed questions for half credit","He mentioned this during the first class after our first midterm. He told us that we would be able to get up to half credit back on our tests, although I don't remember what we specifically needed to do to get the points back.","It is his testing policy. You can resubmit your incorrect question with full work for half credit back.","Prof. [Removed] provides 1/2 points back on tests, and he points out common pitfalls in solving physics problems.","Professor [Removed]'s exam policy allows us to redo exam questions for half point back however we are required to give explanation to each step to show that we understand our prior mistakes.","We can submit a correction after the exam that provides us half points back that we lost.","This is in the syllabus but this has not occurred in class as of yet.","The professor has a half - credit - back policy where in the time between the exam being taken and the next exam, students can come in to correct their test to get half the missed points back. This is meant to facilitate learning from mistakes","We have the opportunity to fix our exam mistakes for half credit back.","We can earn back credit through various assignments like the lecture assignments, the reflections, and this survey. This is ongoing through out the course. There are 2 lecture assignments per week","There has been one quiz where Dr. [Removed] sent out a post - quiz reflection assignment in which we could earn back minimal credit for our original quiz score. I haven't had my grade updated yet, but I assume the teaching team will let us know when they have updated everything. This was for our first quiz, so I'm unsure if this reflection will happen for all quizzes or if it was a one - time thing.","the instructor allowed us to submit a quiz reflection based on our thoughts of our grade we received. by allowing us to reflect on our study methods we are able to improve","She has extra credit questions on each lecture we have that we can submit at the end of the week. I really appreciate those because by doing them I also gain more clarity on the topic.","We have opportunities to earn extra credit, not points back so much as earning extra. Taking this survey is an example of ways to earn additional credit. These opportunities give quiet a few points that help boost grades.","Dr. [Removed] puts zombie questions on upcoming tests that encourage students to look back over previous exams and helps their future exam scores.","The practices she posts for homework and practice exams are counted towards extra credit on our final grade.","Every exam we always go over the most missed questions, and they show up on the next test.","I am actually not exactly sure how this works, as I haven't needed to pursue any back credit on exams. However, I have heard from friends in the class that he allows exam corrections.","Dr. [Removed] allows for the final to replace the lowest midterm grade. This shows that by the end of the semester, the student understands and knows physics better, and therefore deserves an opportunity to fix a mistake made earlier on.","If we do well on our final exam, that score will replace our lowest score on one of the three midterms. Dr. [Removed] said this on the first class day, I believe.","This course is based on attendance.","This is a pass fail class","He provides many help, as we have extra credit showing to his office hours and many other things also the modules wr have three chances to redo them and for [Removed] she proves the same and we have leaning reflections and feedbacks we give her.","We didn't have class last week so we were given an assignment to complete in our free time. Some students either did part of it wrong or forgot to complete it, so the instructor said she would give them time to go back and complete it for full credit.","N / A","there aren't exams or assignments really, but i was able to get credit back for absences while i had COVID","He has not done this.","I apologize for answering the last question incorrectly - this seems like something the instructor would have said, but I'm not completely sure.","The course's grading scheme is designed to allow students a grade improvement if they work hard on improving past mistakes. Dr. [Removed] reminds us of this very often.","At the end of the semester when the final exam is taken, the instructor has stated that if the final exam grade Is higher than that of our base course grade, they will replace the course grade with the final exam grade. The instructor does this because they know that sometimes it takes a while to successfully learn the material and doing this gives us the chance to make up for past mistakes on exams.","The way her grading scheme is made up allows students to raise their overall grade or their quiz grade average if we perform adequately later in the course. It allows us to prove that we learned from our mistakes and helps us improve overall.","She does not provide opportunities to earn BACK credit on exams. However, she does prepare us and give more than enough resources, guidance, and opportunity to voice our concerns about the content.","she creates two exams with the second being harder to let people try to make up.","The professor allows exam retakes, although harder than the first exam, it would give the opportunity to earn a higher grade.","We have 3 midterms and you can retest on the midterms for full credit after receiving your original score. This allows students to study their mistake and improve for the retest.","A retake is held a week after every exam, which is optional and available to all students. The instructor mentioned this multiple times beforehand and explained in detail the expectations for both the exams and the retakes. After results were posted from the exam, students had several days to ask questions in class, go to office hours, and find other resources to prepare for the retake.","Professor [Removed] allows for all students to take makeup exams, regardless of how they did on the original exam. She emphasizes that it will cover the same content, though she notes that the questions may be slightly harder, so we're not encouraged to flunk the original exam and just plan to take the makeup. She allows this for every exam we take ; there are 3 midterms throughout the semester, so that's 6 total exams we have the opportunity to take -- and she'll take the better grade of the two ( original or makeup )."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

This happens on a weekly basis since a lot of the lectures are interactive/ require us to apply our knowledge.","During the lecture times we will be given a question to work through with the people around us.","She can ask a question and then wait before answering. she also recommends you to talk to students around you to brainstorm before she gives y' all the answer straight up.","She'll ask a question and tell us that she's giving us some time to think about it before we come together and talk about it.","for instapolls","We are supposed to complete learning modules before each lecture. By doing this we get exposed to the information and can formulate questions.","She asks questions on slideshows. Then she waits until we all have talked it through to move on.","When we got to reviewing [Removed] [Removed] in lecture the other day, w","Every lecture day Dr. [Removed] always has us talk to the person next to us about the material we are learning that day. She then asks if we have questions and then answers them.","Every time we have a question that we need to think about ourselves, we have ample time to talk to our niehgbors, I've never felt rushed during these moments. This happens pretty much every single class.","She allows students to talk to a classmate or complete insta polls in class.","We are given time to discuss the question before Dr. [Removed] shows and explains the correct answer","The teacher will give the class a question and allow them to think of it on their own for someone or discuss it with a partner during the lecture.","During class, in between slides, we have active learning time that allows us to think and solve a problem before moving on to the next concept. After 2 - 3 minutes the instructor solves the problem.","In the lectures we are always given time to discuss amongst each other.","This happened during monday's lecture. The professor would ask us a question, and tell us to take some time to think about our answer and talk to a neighbor about what we think the answer to the question is. During that lecture for example, she asked us about the internal energy equation.","We are often given questions all throughout each class to think about independently before the instructor shares how to solve the problem. We are also encouraged to collaborate on each question.","She gives lots of time between questions to discuss before she will move on.","She provides pauses in between her lectures to allow students to think critically on a concept being taught at the moment. [Removed] she doesn't answer the questions herself as she is continuing on with the lecture, there are TAs availabe and walking around to answer the questions for her.","While doing in class problems, she first allows us to try to solve it on our own. After a minute or two she talks it out with us. This happens every week.","She would give us time to communicate with our neighbors before giving us the answers during the lectures.","She often gives us time to answer her questions by talking to others near us before she moves on and gives us the answers. This happens every class.","Every lecture, there are practice problems that are available for us to solve in class and then review as a group and this occurs for every major topic that might require practice to truly master.","[Removed] asks questions, and then gives us a few minutes to talk to the person next to us about what we think the answer is. Sometimes the question is unable to be answered because she hasn't talked about the material yet.","The professor will have questions on the slides and instruct the students to come up with an answer independently before she reveals the answer. This happens 1 - 3 times per lecture.","Again, in such a large class, it can be difficult to go through coursework slow enough for everyone to understand. For instance, I am a slow learner, and often need more time, but the instructors try their best to help everyone.","Every class she provides questions that we can independently think about. This allows us to be able to grasp concepts better.","I would say that this statement applies when she gives students time to answer the word problems she presents. She gives enough time for students to solve the issues, as they are not difficult or aim to trick the students. If students have questions, they can ask the TA's.","She lets us answer some questions on the board so you can do it alone or ask for help","[Removed]","The time given is fine","Dr. [Removed] always gives a moment for students to discuss lecture materials with peers or ask ta [Removed] any questions before moving onto the next topic.","She gives us practice problems to do during class, allows us time to do them, and then reviews them in the same class.","Everyday we answer questions on our own or with a partner","N / A","I agree. This has been done.","She lets us answer on instpolls and problems during class to for this","When we have instapolls, she gives us a few minutes to figure out the answer and discuss with one another.","usually during lecture after each question she would ask us to reflect with other people","When we do practice problems in class she will pause for a couple minutes to let us think. It's usually enough time to think through it on our own, and she does this every class.","Dr. [Removed] will often give us time to think or reflect before answering course related questions.","She would ask us to talk to our peers and gives us a minute or two to think about it.","She will often post a question on the board during lectures and encourage us to talk to the students around us and solve the question. The amount of time she gives varies on the question and day, sometimes it's more than enough time, and other times it's very little time.","Throughout the lecture, she poses numerous questions to the students. The students have to think about it and answer before Dr. [Removed] gives the answer and works out the problem.","Whenever we are going through the lecture, she gives us about 5 - 7 minutes to think about the question before moving on and explaining the material.","In the course, the professor allocates time for students to solve in - class problems that will further their knowledge of chemistry. This is typically and everyday task, and I feel as though it has genuinely helped me. Often, Dr. [Removed] will say \" I will allow you to talk out a couple of problems with your neighbor, and we will come back together to figure out the solution. \" This gives us the opportunity to create bonds and relationships with our peers and aid in our learning of the course.","I am not able to recall a specific instance however there are multiple times in class Dr [Removed] allows us to think through questions with our neighbors and usually provides way more than enough time.","My instructor consistently had Active Learning activities in between the content she would teach. These activities would be practice problems or questions relating to the content and it would allow us to converse with our peers relating to the information.","Our professor often does this at least once in each lecture where she explains the content then allows us to work with our neighbors to figure out the right answer and to discuss with our peers as to why we got our answer. This allows us to correct our mistakes before moving on to the next topic.","The instructor would have \" active Learning \" moments where she wouldn't teach and instead let students talk to each other and work through a practice problem. This would happen many times throughout lecture. Each moment was around 5 minutes, which is enough for students to gain understanding.","When showing an example she will ask us to talk with a neighbor. During this time, we are given about 6 - 8 minutes to understand the topic on our own. This happens most classes.","We usually have time for \" active learning \" each class which entails students doing problems independently for a few minutes. It's helpful if you know someone in the class because a friend could help explain the concept or work throughout. Otherwise, it's not super helpful for students who prefer working alone.","Dr. [Removed] includes spaces in the lecture where she provides a question and lets students work it out before going over it. We can work alone or with other people which helps clear up confusing concepts. She does this every lecture.","She asked a question and gives students plenty of time to deduce the answer or receive help if necessary.","Every day there is at least one instance of Dr [Removed] asking a question to the class and then allowing time for discussion with peers before answering it on the board.","Within our course she lets us talk to the people sitting beside us to discuss what we think would be the correct answer to the question that is asked. Then she would walk us through the answer. She will also let us do this with the [Removed] instapolls.","During the lectures, the professor would tell the class to turn and talk with the people around us for a couple of minutes about what we think the answers are to the questions on the learning slides. Then, the professor would tell everyone to come back as a class so that the professor could explain the correct answer. However, there are times when I think that the professor does not give the class enough time to turn and talk, causing these independent thinking times to feel rushed during the lecture.","Professor [Removed] injects small questions into her lectures to allow students to apply the knowledge they are trying to grasp ; these are present in every lecture. Usually, she introduces the application question, asks the class to think and share their thoughts, maybe asks the class as a whole, and then goes on to explain the scenario further.","The professor gives lots of time for us to do independent thinking before telling us the answer.","In active learning session, she always gives students time to think about the answer and share it with others","We have many moments in class to discuss with our peers. Also, she makes sure to periodically check in with the class to see if we have any questions.","I believe [Removed] [Removed] also gave enough time for students to think because every lecture she gives us around three minutes for the class discussion questions to talk amongst ourselves and this time can tell us if we know how to do it or not and it was very helpful.","Usually when we are going over a topic our professor will tell us to try out the question on our own. She tells us to work on it by ourself or with someone next to us. She will give us enough time to get through most or ate least half of it. After a while she will work it out and then ask us if we are good to move on if their is something that we don't understand.","We have some times in class where we discuss with a partner before she works out a problem on the board. This doesn't happen super often though and I'm not sure how many people actually participate.","Mrs. [Removed] will give us a question about the topic that we are learning that day in class, and she will always ask \" Do y' all understand, are y' all good? \" So, I would say that she does a great job.","There are active learning sections throughout each lecture. In these sections, Dr. [Removed] asks us a question and gives us time to discuss with our neighbors before she explains the answer.","They would show a question on the screen about a topic we learned and give us about 30 - 45 ish seconds to answer the question. Afterward, they would answer the question. I'd say this happens in almost every lecture.","Gives students the time to talk independently, however not enough and just jumps straight into the answer. While everyone is talking, expects students to stop talking when giving us the time to talk","The professor asks a question gives us time to figure it out on our own then shows us the process in which to find the answer. She uses this technique during every lecture.","We're given a few minutes to look at an image or solve a problem. Can be alone or collaborative. Every class.","During her lectures she encourages us to write down our thoughts and question for her to answer at the end of class, and also gives us time during her class to have discussions amongst out peers around us about the topic at hand.","She assured that students knew what they were doing and gave us the answers.","After some topics, the lecturer encourages us to talk to the people around us about the topic to better help us understand the material.","In our chemistry class, the instructor would often present a complex question and give us several minutes to think it through independently before discussing it as a group. This usually occurred during problem - solving sessions, with the instructor saying, “ Take a few minutes to work through this on your own — don't rush. ” This approach allowed us to develop our own understanding before engaging in class discussions. \n\n","This happened in our most recent class in the active learning section of slides it is given a question and she lets us discuss with a partner what we think the answer is or why something makes sense","During lectures, she pauses and asks us to reflect on the content given and make connections as to how we can remember the content she just went over. The learning modules on [Removed] are independent but once we are in class we can ask questions.","Before solving a calculation or word problem, Professor [Removed] provides ample time for students to try and figure it out on their own.","Our instructor asks us to personally talk with our peers during lecture. They want us to answer questions that relate to the current topic in hand.","Whenever she gives us an example question, she pauses and gives us time to think and talk around about it. During that time, the TA's also walk around to help answer questions.","We often have work time in class where she gives us 2 - 4 minutes to attempt to answer the equation, then she goes in depth and shows us how to properly solve it.","I'm almost all of our lectures, our professor explains the material and then gives us thought questions and practice questions to discuss with fellow peers. This period of discussion of what was taught allows us independently think and discuss the material.","Dr. [Removed] clearly cares about her students and gives lots of resources for students to be successful. However, I wish we would get time to understand the material before having a quiz.","Dr. [Removed] allows us time to work through the problems on her slides before she gives us the answers in order to encourage active learning, but I think that she's at a disadvantage because it's such a large class and we have so much material to cover. Sometimes I feel like she moves on before I understand something, and that freaked me out a lot during the first few times that it's happened. However, she's always super encouraging, and constantly tells us that we'll get it in more time.","She usually asks this when she asks us a question regarding the content and lets us talk to our neighbors about the question. She said to talk it out.","When we work through problems in class we get a chance to turn and talk with the people next to us before she explains it.","During every lecture, she gives us time to solve the question ourselves and discuss with neighbors before going over the problem","Yes the instructor would always say that we should think or answer the question. This is very helpful in giving us the adequate time to review and figure out the answer.","The instructor often gives us ample time to think individually or collaborate with students near us, so it's common for us to think before answering.","In every class during lecture, she gives us question. She stops teaching at this moment and gives us enough time to think independently to answer the question. She also gives us time to discuss with peers.","Multiple times a class, she will present us with questions and gives us time to come up with an answer either on our own or with the people next to us, before giving the whole class the answer.","The instructor does ask questions and ask the students to think amongst themselves and confer with others. This does allow time for the students to think about concepts and questions they may have.","She asked if electron configuration was understood and most people said yes and/or shook their heads.","The professor asks a lot of questions during lecture to ensure that students are thinking and understanding the material.   She always makes sure to give us time to talk to other students and think for ourselves before going over the answer.","When working examples in class, the professor aways encourages group discussion. In doing so, she believes it fosters greater understanding of the content.","After the instructor went over a topic, she'd tell us to talk about it with the people sitting next to us. We do this often for about a minute.","The professors asks us to answer questions and talk to our neighbor every class except on exam days. She usually gives us around 3 minutes to answer the question ( s ).","She displays practice problems and gives us about 2 - 3 minutes to answer before she closes the instapoll.","Everytime there are practice problems on the screen during our lecture, our teacher gives us about 30 seconds to discuss it with the people next to us. After this, she then goes over the answer, which gives us some time to first attempt the problem before anything else.","She always gives us time to work independently on certain questions, and while we do that, she works it on the board. We also have plenty of time to collaborate with others and come to conclusions.","During lecture, students will do practice problems independently or with a partner from the slide. Dr. [Removed] will then go over it.","My teacher lets us collaborate and answer questions that are on the board at least once every class.","during the lecture","I can not remember","We don't ask questions about the lecture during the actual lecture, so this allows us to specifically think about questions we want to ask, and then we can go into the office hours.","When we are doing practice problems on topics such as unit conversions and drawing [Removed] structures, Dr. [Removed] puts the problem up on the screen and gives us time to do them before doing them herself and allowing us to check our work. She usually does a few problems together as a class before giving us problems of the same type to try on our own.","In every lecture she will let us talk about the question she puts up on the board to the people next to us and the TAs before moving on to explain the question.","There is a lot of course material that needs to be covered in a short amount of time so there is a very quick turnaround between asking a question and needing to move on. Though not one specific instance comes to mind, we are asked to consider practice problems nearly every lecture and, in most cases, are given time to think about it and work through it. However, some more complicated and newly introduced concepts are not always given an adequate amount of time to ask a TA questions or write it out and talk it over with fellow students.","After introducing a topic we will   usually do a practice problem and she gives us time to complete the problem. The TAs and there to help if we need it.","During lectures we will have around 5 minutes to answer a question before we go over it as a class","When the professor introduces or explains a new topic, she will usually pause for a bit to let the class take in what they are seeing and to have time to think about questions.","This class if just a fast paced course, it can be challenging to get ahead of the curriculum because of what we are assigned already.   The learning modules aren't posted as promptly as I would like and sometimes two are due on the same day without any announcement that we have an extra learning module we have to account and make time for.","She uses some questions to find out whether we understand that part. She gives about 3 minutes every time to think about the problem.","The instructor will have us discuss with each other or think about a problem or topic before just giving us the answer.","Dr. [Removed] gives ample time for practice problems and encourages our own independent thinking. This is helpful for me as it gives me time to make sure I understood the material.","During each lecture, the professor pauses frequently to give us opportunities to think and talk amongst ourselves about the content. This helps us make inferences and piece together the information independently rather than passively listen to her talk.","The class moves fast because there are 300 people in the room, but she allows some time for TAs to go around and answer questions.","Professor [Removed] always has her students participate in “ active learning ” where her slides during the lecture have a problem for us to figure out, and lets us talk amongst ourselves to try and figure it out. This is super helpful because sometimes concepts make more sense when another student explains.","When the professor is lecturing during class, they give us practice questions and time to solve and work with our partners. This happens during every lecture, multiple times a lecture.","When she provides an example, she expects us to try out best to work through the problem individually first, and then she goes over the material after some time.","Dr. [Removed] incorporates several [Removed] in class and always is sure to provide time warnings for when they are going to close.","[Removed] [Removed] always takes a moment to let us solve questions by ourselves.

She also allows us to collaborate with our peers when we have a problem or are stuck.","She encourages us to work out problems on our own before she shows us how to do it. It is helpful because it actually insights learning versus blind copying.","We were given a few practice problems to work out, and time was allotted to solve and discuss these problems with people around us before revealing the solutions.","The instructor provided opportunities to practice problems that are very important concepts to the related Unit every lecture. During these opportunities, the instructor would say \" try this problem by yourselves \".","She will often ask practice questions throughout her lectures, but will not really go through it step by step.

This allowed us to work independently for a little while before giving us an opportunity to ask questions.","The instructor typically went over the material as a group but gave individuals the opportunity to ask for help privately if necessary. This occurs with every lab day and allows individuals to focus on what they know and to ask for help on things they need assistance on.","She lets us ask questions about our lab assignments and helps when needed.","Before taking our first quiz which took place on a Wednesday, she gave us questions we could study from a week in advance.

After a couple of minutes and most tables have finished the problem, Dr. [Removed] goes over the answer to ensure that everybody got the right answer and understood the concept. This happens in every class.","I feel like Dr. [Removed] stops and lets us think about a problem / [Removed] most of the time, but sometimes she goes a bit fast. The first unit is a lot of math and logic, and sometimes it takes a bit longer to solve / figure out the problem. Dr. [Removed] occasionally starts to answer the [Removed] before most of the class arrives at the answer. Recently, she did a class poll on how well we understood the content, and 90 % of the class had not had a firm understanding of genetics, including me.","As an example, just today there two or more occasions where Dr. [Removed] stopped to let us think about a problem before sending it to us on [Removed]. She specifically said she was giving us time to think.","Every single class, Dr. [Removed] gives us instapolls and opportunities to talk amongst our selves about the content we are going over. She always waits til we have discussed to ask someone to speak to the rest of the class about it or answer questions.","This is especially apparent in the Instapolls that are held in class. During these Instapolls, students are given plentiful time to collaborate and apply their knowledge regarding concepts that they just learned.","We have a lot of time to answer instapolls. First we think independently, then we think as a group, and finally she goes over the answer.","After asking multiple [Removed] questions in class, Dr. [Removed] will give everyone at least 2 minutes per question to write down an answer before revealing the answer and/or asking people what they put. Dr. [Removed] does this every class and always pauses to listen to other students before giving conclusive answers.","Dr [Removed] will call on tables to answer questions in class and she gives us plenty of time to think and discuss.","We have [Removed], where we choose an answer independently and then discuss with our team before discussing as a class. The instapolls are based off of that day's lecture materials.","This usually happens during the [Removed] and when there are questions in the slides. Before revealing the answer, we are allowed to discuss how to solve the problem or come up with an answer with peers before the answer is revealed. After that time is up, Dr. [Removed] allows us to share our thoughts and what we think is the right answer before revealing the answer and going a bit more in depth with the topic.","We always have [Removed] with questions every class of which we think independently before she answers or explains the question.","The instructor gives lots of instapoll questions during lecture and provides plenty of time to think through the question. This happens regularly multiple times throughout every lecture. The first time they did this the instructor encouraged group work to answer the question.","[Removed] is used for attendance and how questions that must be answered, students answer the questions together first and then the teach goes over the correct answer.","She would just give us a couple of minutes to work on insta polls or think about group questions before calling on us.","For our instapolls and lectures during class, she always gives us time to think independently before lecturing the answer to the class.","Daily instapolls have plenty of time set before the instructor provides the answer.","The instructor frequently integrates open - ended questions about the material being taught to provide students with an opportunity to think independently. The most recent example was the most recent lecture where she asked us to explain the change in entropies.","In each lecture, the professor would present about 4 - 6 practice questions in groups of 2 - 3, allowing us to engage with the material actively. After reading each question, she would give us at least five minutes to think independently before discussing our answers with classmates, emphasizing, \" Take your time ; I want to hear your thoughts before we dive into the solution. \" This approach ensured that we had ample time to process the information and encouraged meaningful class discussions before she guided us through the problems as a group.","We have instapolls every class where we try and answer a question with our group or by ourselves. She gives us like 3 minutes or sometimes more, and then she answers the question.","She always lets us discuss instapolls and other questions to let us try, before giving us the explanation and answer. I value that she lets us change our answer after the initial attempt.","Dr. [Removed] would teach us a new materials and let us discuss within ourselves or our designated section. This would only last a minute or three, and then she would call on one of the section to answer.","Dr. [Removed] encourages collaboration of students through the use of instapolls and class participation. It allows us to not only think for ourselves, but to check with others our knowledge and maybe even teach another on specific topics.","We have instapolls during class where she asks us questions, gives us time to respond, and then explains the answer. This happens multiple times each class.","Homeworks and quizzes","During instapoll questions, Dr. [Removed] always sets a timer for a few minutes on her phone for us to collaborate. Additionally, in discussion sections, she ensures that we were given enough time to complete each activity before moving on.","She pauses for enough time before the [Removed] for us to think about the answer to the questions. She also gives us time to think about questions for her as well every class and discussion section.","We have instapolls during class that she allows time for us to complete before going over the material. If we don't understand it we are encouraged to go to her office hours \n","Dr. [Removed] usually gives us a few minutes to answer the instapolls, allowing us time to reflect on our responses. Afterward, she explains the correct answer.","She does questions in class and gives us time to discuss and think before answering as a class","Dr. [Removed] ensures that students have enough time sharing answers with each other as we are answering Instapolls in class. She also makes sure to answer all questions that are asked in class.","Lets us discuss answers in groups. [Removed] we come together as a class to discuss","we are encouraged to discuss questions amongst our groups first.","She always gives us time to think about questions that were asked or reflect on what we just learned every class.","Professor [Removed] gives us enough time to work with our team members before she starts going up to those who still has questions and begins explaining the answer to the class.","Mostly during Instapolls in class.","During [Removed], she encourages class discussion and individual thinking before revealing the answer.","She does instapols in class to help us learn and discuss with each other on what the answer would be.","In this course, the instructor consistently allowed students a few minutes to think independently before asking for responses to questions. For instance, after presenting a complex problem, they would say, “ Take two minutes to think about your approach, [Removed] down any initial thoughts, and then we'll discuss. ” This pause gave everyone time to gather their ideas, which led to more thoughtful answers and a willingness to participate, as students felt less pressure to respond immediately","Dr. [Removed]'s [Removed] keep us engaged in the lecture. This semester, I learned how to annotate her slides and perform calculations. I am developing this note taking skill in her class ( including my other ones ), but we all will throughout the semester and year!","When we are in class, Dr. [Removed] goes through each slide of the module very thoroughly and asks students questions while completing such. She asks the whole class a question, gives us time to think about it, then asks different student what they think. If the student answered incorrectly then she explains the correct answer with a very understanding and open response. Even if a student answers the question correctly, she makes sure to talk through how to get the answer for those that did not understand.","The instructor gives an instapoll question of the material we are learning. The instructor gives us time to read the question and answer it on our own. Then he will explain the process of the question.","Our professor would put up instapolls on the board every class and would ask us to solve problems on our own with the people sitting next to us.","In almost every class our professor will work out problems with us and ask us to think about it, discussing with friends if we do not understand or are having issues thinking independently. He also asks us about homework throughout the week it's due, after we've had time to review and try.","Dr. [Removed] allows students to calculate their own answers while practicing instapolls before he goes over the problem as a class.","After working out the beginning of a problem, Dr [Removed] always gives us a chance to solve it ourselves before he shows us how to do it or ask any questions about it","He always gives us time to collaborate with each other to try to solve problems before he brings the class back together. It makes the class significantly more engaging that just being lectured at for 50 min [Removed]","This happens every class where we do [Removed] as practice on the topics he covers in class, usually with a slight trick or something we would encounter in the homework or practice problems. He lets us try to solve them and ask him or the TA questions if we have any with plenty of time, and after some time he will go over them with us and ask for participation in the quest for the answer.","When lecturing, Dr. [Removed] encourages us to reflect on our knowledge by asking questions and letting us sit with them and try to understand them on our own.","every class, he lets us work together and with the TA's to do problems, which are submitted on instapoll","Dr. [Removed] always encourages class participation, and he will pause and tell us to talk with our neighbors to discuss what we think. Then we'll come together and he'll call on some of us. This happens about every class. He usually gives us 1 - 2 minutes to think and talk before he gives us the answers, and he doesn't discourage wrong answers. While working on practice problems, he'll also pause and ask us what we think and have us think for a moment ( because it's usually pretty simple ) before we answer.","He gives us plenty of opportunities to test our knowledge and gives us plenty of time to come to an answer before he discusses it with the class. There are multiple times during class when we have this opportunity.","We were working on a problem and before he started he had us work on it with our partners","He asks questions every class pertaining to example problems he draws on the board. He gives us about 5 min to answer the question before allowing us to collaborate, and discussing the answers with us.","During collaboration time, we have time to think of and ask questions during class. Dr. [Removed] gives thorough answers and makes sure we all understand the concepts.","Dr. [Removed] loves to get us thinking ( its a pain in the moment though ). He'll usually give us problems that we haven't seen before and work it out in baby steps, pausing along the way to get our input.","Was thinking about today in class when he asked us to figure out the forces that apply to the moving crate. He first told us to do it and then discuss it with a partner. After he heard us speak and motivated us to talk he shared the answer.","During instapolls, professor [Removed] always give us roughly 5 minutes for us to work the problems out. Also, when we have questions he gives us time to ask them","Every time Dr. [Removed] teaches a new topic, he leaves room for students to ask any questions. Sometimes he will even ask questions to make sure that students have an understanding of what was covered and patiently wait until someone responds to his question.","My professor performs class instapolls in which we work independently before he explains how to get to the correct answer. He does this for every class.","He has us do instapolls and gives us time to work independently with a partner before we go over it as a class.","For every problem, there is time to solve independently before moving on to coming to the solution as a group.","One of the big aspects of this class is group work. The professor gives us a problem and gives us enough time to work it out and discuss with our peers before he helps us solve it on the board. He really tries to get us to solve the problem first ourselves, and helps us work our way to the answer.","Every day Dr. [Removed] uses [Removed] to test our understanding. He will allow us to read the question and attempt to solve it independently and with our neighbor. If we have questions during the independent inquiry, he and the TA's are open to answering. After we've had time to assess the problem he walks us through it and answers questions.","After lecturing, would ask to collaborate and think about the question before moving on. Allows everyone to better understand the topic and get a deeper understanding.","Dr. [Removed] provides instapoll physics questions at least a few times per class and encourages us to work out the problems for a few minutes before he provides us with the solution. Furthermore, he also calls out sections of the room for students to answer questions asked during class.","He gives us time to work through the instapoll questions before going over them together as a class.","We have daily instapolls relating to what we are currently learning in class. We are given time to try to solve the problem with our neighbors before the instructor goes over the question.","The instructor would ask us if we had any questions before he moved on with the material, and wait for people to ask their questions. This happened pretty frequently, but most of the time people were so confused that they couldn't think of questions to ask.","Dr. [Removed] will ask us questions and wait for someone to answer. If there is silence, he is willing to wait. He also usually lets conversation die down before he asks us the question.","In class, the professor will allow us to answer questions as he solves problems, as well as lets us work other ones out on our own before working through them with us. He does this with instapolls mostly.","We do instapolls daily and he gives us time to solve those before going over them as a class.","in class instapolls, allows us to try to apply material and then he solves the problem with the class","Every single time in class Dr. [Removed] will ask us a question and he will wait for us to think independently and then tell us to ask our neighbors.","For all practice problems given in class by Dr. [Removed], he will always give us time for us to answer the question on our own before giving us guidance. Furthermore, he will ask questions throughout his explanations to check for understanding.","dr.perera asked a question and waited until someone answered","After setting up the problem, he would let the class work on it on your own before he steps in. He does this every lecture.","Yes, during each practice questions, the professor gives us time to discuss with our neighbors.","When addressing the class, he often provides ample time to consider his question, and there is enough time given for the polling questions he provides. This happens often, at least once a week.","The instructor allows us to input questions into squarecap and gives us the entire class time while lecture is happening to put our questions. He also gives us a good amount of time to answer around 10 question in twenty minutes to prepare us for exam.","After lecture, he gives us square cap questions and lets us answer them before going over them himself. He gives us at least 10 minutes to answer them ourselves.","After every class, the professor requires us to answer 10 questions in squarecap where we can discuss and elaborate on the material with peers. In my opinion, while challenging, allows us to think critically about the course material and exchange knowledge with our classmates. He will then go over the answers in order to ensure our complete understanding.","While he ended his explanation of the lecture, he always gives us time to solve the problems on ourselves through square cap. Sometimes, the time was tight but I realized that I'm developing my time management skills by this section.","We do squarecaps which goes over the topic learned in class \n","Sqaurecap questions allow this.","Every day in class, Dr. [Removed] gives us questions in the form of squarecaps and always sets enough time for us to answer all the questions. However, sometimes, during the class, he will rush a little and not give us enough time to fully think of our answers.","At the beginning of each class, Dr. [Removed] opens up the squarecap discussion section – which allows students to ask questions about the course anonymously – and makes sure to answer all important questions before we begin our individual squarecap assignment.","The professor makes the TAs go around the class to answer questions on the [Removed], but the [Removed] don't have too much time to think about the answers.","In this course my instructor uses the platform square cap which has a specified comment section where we are allowed to upload questions we have developed throughout the lecture. Once my instructor is done with the lecture he takes the time to answer any questions that were asked.","Dr. [Removed] usually gives us 10 questions about the lecture at the end of class. This helps to utilize what we had just learned and applying it to questions. He also holds a squarecap session live so that we can ask any questions during lecture and he goes over them at the end of class.

He also lets us ask questions if they come up during the class.","Dr. [Removed] gives 15 minutes to complete the squarecap and then goes over the answers.","When we do the square caps, there is usually ample time to answer the questions.","We are given time after he is done lecturing for us to apply what we learned and answered in the square cap.   He goes through and explains why that is the correct answer.","I think it's a bit difficult in class to showcase independent thinking during lecture. Most times, the [Removed] questions just end up being word of mouth of the answers from TAs to students to other students.","Every lecture, squarecap becomes active, containing approximately 10 questions, where he allots everyone about 15 minutes after his lecture to answer the questions before closes them he goes over each question.","We have sufficient time to work on the squarecap at the end and we are also able to write questions we have in there and he answers them after the lecture.","Whenever we do squarecap sessions during our lectures, Dr. [Removed] always gives the class 10 - 20 minutes to go through all the questions ourselves before going over them as a class.","In every lecture, Dr. [Removed] has squarecap sessions in which students are permitted to ask questions in throughout the lecture. He always dedicates time right when the lecture ends to answer the questions.","Sometimes he gives students time to sit and think about what he discusses, however, he can end up moving on to the next topic a little too quickly. This is made up for at the end when he gives us the opportunity to work through questions on squarecap.","When I work on [Removed] at the end of the class period, I have asked him a few questions about concepts I do not understand. He encourages us to work together first, but when I asked him about the concept, he walked me through so I could figure it out on my own. He did not just give me an answer that I would not understand. When he explains it, it seems like common sense almost.","Dr [Removed] allows about 10 - 15 minutes to answer the 10 question squarecap practice at the end of lecture before going over the lectures. He and the TAs walk around to answer any questions we have.","We think independently about the lecture we just learned as we do the square cap","Simply, every lecture the professor asks questions of the students and she waits for them to figure it out before explaining the answer.","She'd give us sometime to think about instapolls before opening them","We were doing a worksheet and she wanted us to try it on our own.

When she does, she usually sets them up with some time to think, and then gives us a reasonable time to answer. Afterwards, she goes over the questions.","She asks if we have any questions during lectures, and answers them before we move on.","I can allude this to office hours and how the lecture is structured. We spend time working through a worksheet in class and then there is a portion where we try to write a block of code on our own. If we still do not understand there is always office hours.","There are questions that are asked in class and we get time to think and answer.","She gives us a question and gives us time tk work on it. She also comes around the room and makes sure we can understand it.","In class, we have independent activities that lets us figure out how to alter codes so we can learn the material ourselves.

This allows students to apply what they just learned in the lecture independently.","There are often problems in our course packet that we work on during class with our groups. This is a collaborative time, where we can work with our groups and ask the professor or TA's any questions we have.","Towards the end of every lecture, Professor [Removed] would have us complete a practice worksheet going over the topic we just covered in class. This practice worksheet would cover a real life scenario and data statistic question that would most likely be asked by a curious figure.

Questions help grasp concepts","We are given time to think through and answer instapoll questions during lectures.","Typically during a lecture, he will explain some relatively complicated dynamic of physics. He will then wait for a little bit and look around for anybody that raised their hand and then continue if nobody did.","This happens every class with [Removed] questions. I find them helpful in that they make sure I am thinking through the content, and Dr. [Removed] says he wants to \" make sure we were listening. \" He provides the answer afterward along with an explanation.","In his instapolls [Removed], gives substantial time for the students to talk to another. He also gives us time to rethink our answers after giving small hints to further our thinking.","In this course, we were given Instapolls at various points in class. This would allow students to work cooperatively to determine what the answer was based on the notes. Following this, if there weren't enough correct answers, the professor would give us hints to help us go on the right track.","The concept checks and the prelectures.","Usually whenever, we start getting inside the classroom ; he gives us time to think about the question on the board before he starts asking / answering questions and working it out on the board. This happened during class was about to start.","In each class, we have pre - lectures that allow us to think about and ask questions before we even enter the classroom. During class, whenever the instructor asks a question, we first discuss it with our classmates before responding to him. This approach helps us engage more deeply with the material and develop our understanding through both independent reflection and collaborative discussion.","I would honestly say that majority of the class is people asking questions and him taking time to answer them","the professor would ask questions and give us several minutes to discuss the problem with our other classmates then he would ask for someone to explain what they chose and why","We would always have a brief review of the last class' topic before learning something new","We discuss the pre lecture and the pre lecture gives us time to think about the topics before coming to class so we can have the time before our questions are answered","for every square cap question he tells us to discuss with each other giving time to figure things out on our own.","When we are asked questions on squarecap, we get a couple minutes to discuss answers with our peers. If the professors sees the students need more time he provides it.","He tends to allow us time to discuss the material or a problem and pose questions or thoughts to him before he goes through the example.","The instructor usually has us work on lecture handouts and we are given the opportunity to complete them and talk about our answers with our classmates before going over the answers.","Will ask questions and wait a little bit before asking for an answer. Also allows us to work through some of the material before being asked questions.","She usually gives us a few minutes to think about a question she presents to us in the lecture.","During lecture we were given an instapoll and 5 minutes to work out our own answers. Then after sharing our thoughts with the class we were guided on how to reach the correct answer.","The instructor gives enough time for students to think independently before asking or answering questions by giving us time to disucess with our peers between each queston or article being read. Afterwards, the instructor would go over the correct answer and gives us more time to think independently before revealing the next questions answers.","We would have practice questions during lecture. This would happen every lecture. Prof. [Removed] would say “ work with your group mates ” or “ think about this ” so we can work on those questions and think like scientists.","We are constantly participating in class. I enjoy hearing from my peers.","Every time he gives us a example question he always gives us time to first try it ourselves.","She pauses to let students come to conclusions.","If she has a question in her slides or if wants us to complete a worksheet in class, she will give us plenty of time before she goes over it. she also asks if everyone is done before she proceeds.","Each time the class is presented with a question she gives us around 5 minutes to discuss our answers independently then with a partner. Then once the question is answered she makes sure not to move on unless the class says yes in agreeance.","questions during lectures or the lecture handouts. She gives us time to read over and analyze and then she will ask us what our thought are and if we have questions.","During lecture, before she goes over a problem she lets people discuss and figure it themselves.","The instructor will give us time to think about what we just learned and will often ask if we have questions after presenting us with an in - class example question. I believe this happens at least once per lecture.","During example questions, our professor would give us 2 - 3 minutes before she starts giving out answers.","We do instapoll questions, which are online questions graded for accuracy and participation. Sometimes, it feels like the problem is easy enough to solve in ~30 seconds, but we spend closer to 2 minutes working independently, and sometimes it feels like I need 3 - 4 minutes, but we end a little earlier, but I think this is just due to not having enough time and different students thinking differently.","When we get practice problems in class, we are given time to independently work through problems before she goes over the answer.","We do [Removed] where professor give us time to work out problems","Professor assigns Instapoll questions allowing students to test their knowledge of the topics and see if they understand the lecture topic. With this information, students can determine whether they need more clarification.","When doing a practice problem, professor [Removed] does give us time to read through it and think about it, but a little more time would be helpful in order to fully digest the problem. We have this independent thinking opportunity every class.","The instructor gives time between slides","When doing squarecaps we have time to work out the problem on our own, then talk with neighbors / LAs and then go over it together in class.","He gives that class time to pair and discuss certain questions before addressing the answers to the class.","During [Removed] questions, Dr. [Removed] gives lots of time to work out and answer the questions with the help of others students of LAs.   This time allows me and other students to work through a problem on our own, increasing our analytical skills and our memory of the problem.","Dr. [Removed] allows su 5 - 10 minutes to discuss with neighbors and LAs our thought process.","2 - 3 times every class, Dr. [Removed] allows us to discuss the question at hand with our partners for 5 - 10 minutes. This has been very consistent every class, which allows us to properly think through the questions.","We do independent problems during class.","He gives out questions on [Removed] covering what we just went over in class. He gives us a few minutes to discuss among each other as well with the teaching staff before going over the answer in class.","We have squarecap quizzes that he allots time for so that we can check our understanding of the topics.","In our lectures he makes sure that we have time to think and ask our neighbors and LA's during practice problems before going over the correct answer and how to get there \n","We reviewed concepts about registration and played a game that demonstrated our knowledge of what we had reviewed. After each question, the instructor clarified and allowed questions after class.","The first two times I went to class we began by having an icebreaker where each student would say which picture they feel represent them. Although this might not seem like your average situation in which students are given time to think independently to answer a question I believe this helped the class bond and made a community out of a seminar class.","Dr. [Removed] teaches very well and has thoughtful comments on every student's answer to questions they have. He tells us to stay calm and do your best, this is great advice.","[Removed] is always asking us if we understand the concept and giving us time to think of answers during an icebreaker. She also gave us an assignment where we wrote what our top 3 values are and to take our time writing our answer before she took up our papers at the end of class.","Yes we are given time to answer the question and also are encouraged to discuss with others our thoughts before we answer them.","Although we are timed due to the amount of class time we have, we are given plenty of time.","When the class has instapoll questions to answer, time is given to think about the answer on your own or through peer collaboration. The professor puts a question on the board and provides a couple minutes ( related to the complexity of the question ) for students to come to an answer independently. Once students have an answer / time is up, the professor asks if anyone would like to say which answer they got and why. If the student happens to be incorrect, the professor very kindly corrects that and provides the correct answer and explanation.","Doing questions in class through instapoll, the instructor ensures everyone has time to analyze and answer the questions.","Gives us time to complete instapolls.","The professor presents a question and allows students some time to think before asking them to share their thoughts.","We are encouraged to talk to people around us while she puts up an [Removed] with questions related to the unit. This occurs almost every class","We were looking at an instapoll for class. The professor encouraged us to discuss with each other, and then gave us more time to think on our own. She would also drop hints if she thought it was necessary. She would then move on to the answer.","Gives opportunities to discuss with classmates and solve problems before moving on.","She gives example problems on instapoll every class, and waits until most everyone in the room has completed the problem before explaining it. She will also allow us to ask her and our neighbors questions about the example before submitting an answer.","She would explain a concept and give us practice problem or ask us to derive certain equations from a concept we just learned. She give us time before giving us the answer and the process on how to get the answer.","The instructor asks the class questions to discuss before continuing with lecture and answering the question posed for the whole class","She gives us time to work through example problems and figuring out derivation. Then, she explains the answer and answers our concept questions.","Dr. [Removed] always gives us time to chat with our peers and think over the questions ourselves before walking us through the problem. I think this is really important so that we can learn to work through the problems ourselves rather than just having them handed to us immediately. She also likes to have students explain why they think a certain answer is right and gives us the benefit of doubt, sometimes admitting she agrees with their points!","He tells us to think independently and then share with eachother.","[Removed] gives us a question and allow us to talk to our peers about our thoughts and after listens to our opinions and thoughts. He also explains more when we are struggling to understand the topic as well.","The instructor often gave lots of time for independent or group thinking. This was all throughout the course. The instructor would often invite the students to \" think on it \".","The instructor allows use to have time to reflect one what he has asked and gives us voluntary choice to share","They just talked about thinking of what you are going to say before asking a question.","Dr. [Removed] loves providing inquiries for us to formulate our own opinions and to challenge ourselves to think about things we have not thought of or about before. With that, Dr. [Removed] allots adequate time and ensures everyone who still needs time, gets it. This answer may be vague but it is a general and normal part of the classroom experience Dr. [Removed] provides ; he gives us the ability to reflect and meditate often.","After students finish their presentations on Thursdays and we answer the reflection questions, the proffessors finish off the last part of class by giving basically a lecture that goes more into depth about the topics we're talking about in class, where they interact a lot with the students. We're always given enough time to answer questions or think about something independently before moving on.","Our instructor gave us time to gather our thoughts before breaking us off into discussion groups.","For our instapoll quizzes he gives us plenty of time to figure out the problem and come up with a solution before we move on.","Whenever Dr. [Removed] goes over a topic in class, she gives her students time tk ask her any questions about it.","In the last class that was held on Wednesday, my teacher went over course schedules and classes we need to take or look at for our certain majors. Whilst going over it, she engaged with us and had us individually open the website and look at our classes. Before moving on she explicitly asked if we had any questions regarding the different degrees or courses and answered them well. Even after that, she waited because she felt there was a question lingering that had not been answered.","She gives us time to think and talk to our groups about the answer before sharing it to the class.","Allowed us to raise our hands to answer questions and also ask questions. There were instances where students have asked for the instructor to slow down."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

This was if someone is falling behind, they can speak up and get clarification or help.","There are a lot of us in the class, so it is hard to make sure everyone understands what is going on before moving on. Every class I always leave feeling like I don't understand something.","Our instructor has a discussion page where students can submit their questions or concerns for the teacher assistants to answer.","The instructor does a pretty good job of clarifying questions during class and has a discussion thread for doubts too. \n","Caudill always gives us a few minutes to collaborate with classmates on the problems she gives us during lecture.","My instructor goes over the material several times and allows us to discuss it.","This happens everytime my instructor has explained the correct answer and how to solve for it ; she asks for any questions comments or concerns before moving on to the next slide.","The instructor is pretty lit. Writes her thought processes on the board and explains the answer","We review it couple of times so i assume everybody understands it.","Professor released a lot of practic exams. She did it for the [Removed] unit and will do it for this unit. She just said it's recommended and I recommended it too.","During lecture [Removed] will give us time to practice in class. She has her TAs walk around to answer things we are confused on","This week during lecture she gauger student reaction to new material.","The instructor often asks if students fully understand the lecture materials. However, in an auditorium with several hundred students, the likelihood of a student who doesn't fully understand to raise his hand is low. Therefore, for many students, including myself sometimes, I am still thinking about one topic, while she moves on to the next topic. This is understandable, as the class must move efficiently, but does everybody understand the material before switching slides? I would say no.","She will consistently ask the audience at her lectures if it is making sense","This happened when she give the last lecture before the exam 1. She gave us instapoll to write down the topics that we still confused and the Friday recitation and office hours were always helpful to answer our questions.","She asks during class whether or not we understand the material, pretty much every class. Furthermore, she takes instapolls to ensure overall understanding.","Before she moves to next topic, she always be like \" is it all good \" or \" you all good \". kinda stuff.","[Removed]","My instructor makes sure we understand the material by providing thorough explanations, examples, and plenty of practice problems before moving to new topics. After introducing a concept, she often says, “ Let's work through this example together to make sure everyone is following. ” She also pauses frequently to ask if anyone has questions the tas can answer, giving us a chance to clarify before continuing.","Dr. [Removed] makes sure we know the material by assigning weekly quizzes and reviewing information on powerpoints after initially taught. This happens weekly.","The instructor would have various practice questions embedded in throughout the lecture where we could take a few minutes and work with a partner to solve. This would allow students to review and learn the topic that was just taught.","She does review slides of the topics we learned the previous days. This is helpful to ensure that we understand the material before moving on to the next topics","She would explain the material and then give us time to discuss, asking if we have questions. Some students may have still not understood.","allowed for instapolls, allowed for discussions [Removed] classmates, etc.","She just moves on too fast. She would explain something, give like 30 seconds for us to take in what she said and moves on.","students can ask any questions in ed discussion or see a bunch of resources on the [Removed] page. All possible scenarios are discussed in class before moving on","She introduces the material and teaches it first. Then, she gives practice problems to reinforce understanding.","After and before in class demonstrations, [Removed] would take the time to explain what principle her experiment was explaining. Also posts explanations to past quizzes.","This doesn't really happen due to the topics being scheduled out and the lecture hall being massive","My professor routinley checks in on if we are learning the material well. Moreover, she has office hours very often where students can ensure they understand the material.","The instructor frequently waits for questions and makes sure there is a positive response from students after teaching a new concept.","On Wednesday, we were learning about [Removed] [Removed] and the rules that apply. Dr. [Removed] made sure to go over all of the rules of [Removed] [Removed] and practiced solving Lattice [Removed] problems with the students.","Professor [Removed] gives us time to talk to our classmates about confusing concepts and then reclarifies the concept.","Our professor uses [Removed] to assess student learning. Dr [Removed] moves on from a topic after learning that most students answered the [Removed] correctly. This happens at least once per class.","whenever she's done reviewing a topic, a few slides, or even a simple idea, she makes sure to ask everyone if there are any questions before moving on to the next thing","The instructor allows us to chat with a partner in given times to make sure that we can help each other understand the topic. Its going to be very hard in a 400 person class to make sure that everyone understands before moving on but gives us a good opportunity to do so \n","In our course, our teacher gives us a couple minutes to review concepts after she has introduced it and talked about it a bit. These chunks of review time are given multiple times each class, and are very helpful to connect the dots. It's our teacher's way of making sure we all at least have reviewed the information we need, if nothing else.","The professor has an [Removed] Discussion link where all students with questions can ask them and get a thoughtful response from the professor or a TA. The professor also reviews all the topics we need to know in class, giving us time to digest the information.","After going over electron configuration [Removed] asked if we understood how to get there","The instructor goes over the test averages and makes sure that everyone got a decent to good grade. After doing this she moves on to the next material and prepares us for the next test.","Honestly this isn't really true just because the class moves quickly due to its size and amount of content needed to cover. When answering, I mainly just thought of how she generally asks \" does everyone understand? \" before moving on.","We were talking about exceptions to the octet rule this past wednesday and the teacher gave us time to answer 2 work questions for it and her and the TAs went around giving help until there was no more help needed.","The instructor would sometimes move on to other material before we all understood. Especially this week because we have a test next week.","I mean we go over the material in learning modules too so the information discussed in class is just a refresh on the modules we did.","She used [Removed] discussion to answer students questions, but I do wish she spend more time making sure everyone understood topic before moving on and had polls of questions she would answer in class about some stuff.","Caudill helps understand the course through the lecture. Office hours also help.","She usually goes over each topic several times to ensure we understand it. This is good to make sure every student understands what is being taught.","Dr. [Removed] makes sure to teach us what we need to know, and provides many opportunities to ask questions. We don't ask questions during class but there are many other ways to ask questions.","She always says \" we will come back to this and practice more. \"","The instructor asks us if there are any questions and allows for TA's to assist. She has different resources for typical student questions.","In her slide show for lecture / note taking day, she always incorporate questions that related to the topic we are talking about to test our knowledge and gave a better understanding. She always let the students talk / discuss with each other and then she would go over the questions that many students my have.","after going over a topic, she asks if everyone is clear on it. if someone has questions, she takes time to clarify the topic.","During the two sessions per week we have with her, she appoints [Removed] instapoll for one day which she gives during lectures and the other day is for in - class quiz which she gives at the end of the lecture.","She stopped and allowed us to work on the content she also frequent reviews important concepts in multiple lectures","The instructor stops occasionally during lectures to give students time to work on a practice problem. This happens in most lectures. The instructor mentions that she is giving students time to work on a practice problem.","This course allows us to retake 2 exams and a lot of extra credit. This happens at the end of the course after all the exams.","Dr. [Removed] ensures that most students in the class have understood a particularly challenging topic by incorporating an [Removed] question during the lecture, adding in a live demonstration, or helping us memorize a useful mnemonic. By engaging students, particularly through Instapolls, Dr. [Removed] is able to gauge what percentage of students have successfully understood the topic, what the gaps in our knowledge are, and uses it as an opportunity to explain how to tackle a question type.","Dr. [Removed] gives us a lot of time to think through questions before we answer them. She lets us talk amongst ourselves and has the TAs walking around, ready to answer any questions. I think this time is fully sufficient for most students to understand the material.","Dr. [Removed] frequently pauses after explaining a concept or question to allow time for questions.","In [Removed], before moving on to new topics, the instructor often paused to review key concepts and checked for understanding by asking a series of interactive questions, either through in - class polling or by calling on students to explain their thought processes. This usually happened at the end of each lecture section or at key checkpoints during complex topics, like atomic structure or thermodynamics. The instructor would say things like, “ Let's make sure everyone is with me on this, ” or “ Take a moment to try this problem on your own, and we'll go over it together. ” Afterward, they would address common mistakes or misconceptions directly, ensuring that everyone felt confident about the material before proceeding.","The instructor would ask if there were any questions before moving on. This would give students an opportunity to address concerns they had or questions they needed answers to.","We have quizzes every week.","We move on from the units quickly.","She gives us time after every question she asks us to discuss with our peers surrounding us and ask the TAs near us questions. We always have time to talk through our answers.","During every other lecture she posts an [Removed] that gives us practice on the established material. The module quizzes and practice tests also provide an opportunity for us to test our knowledge prior to any big tests or assignments.","The teacher, upon receiving a question, wouldn't stop until full understanding was achieved. This happened a couple of times throughout the course, but I can't remember any specifics regarding when or the material itself.","My professor goes over the previous days topic for about half the class, but no one really asks questions. It's likely difficult for her to gauge our understanding because we don't ask any questions.","Dr. [Removed] does a very good job of breaking her lectures into bite - sized sections that are relevant to the instructional learning modules assigned and due before that class. This allows the students to have a good few days to learn the material and then moreover review it in class.","For example, we usually do practice questions after reviewing new material. Today, after giving us sufficient time to answer, she usually waits until someone or multiple people tell her what they believe to be the answer before revealing it.","In this class, the professor would ask if we understood the material after going over the concept. She would also go over the answers and give us time in class to complete the practice she placed on the board. This happened in every class that I've attended this school year.","In the lecture slides, there would be practice problems and the instructor would give us some time to go over them.

She would do this multiple times in every class to make sure we all had a chance to practice and get used to it before moving to the next topic.","Professor [Removed] just kind of moves on to the next topic","In the course, the instructor frequently paused after introducing new concepts to check for understanding using quick polls, quizzes, or open Q&amp;A sessions. This usually happened at the end of each major lecture or topic segment, where the instructor would say, “ I want to make sure everyone feels confident about this before we move on — let's take a moment to go over any questions you have. ”","During lecture, she often gives time for students to reflect on what she has just taught and ensures that we have understood the concepts. The professor pauses lecture and asks the class to talk with classmates and ensure understanding every lecture.","Honestly, I can't recall exactly if she did this this week specifically, but more often than not, she would ask the class as a whole of they understand certain topics, often more challenging ones, and if there's an overwhelming amount of nonresponse, then she would delve deep into the topic. The best example of this was when she was discussing how to combine formulas in the last unit.","In [Removed] 301, the instructor frequently paused during lectures to check for understanding, often asking conceptual questions to the class and giving students a moment to discuss in pairs or small groups before addressing the entire class. For example, after explaining stoichiometry, the instructor would ask, \" Can anyone explain how we got from here to here? \" or \" What would happen if we changed this value? \" This ensured that students were following the material before moving on. Additionally, after a difficult concept, the instructor would say, \" Let's take a couple of minutes to work through this example together, \" and would walk the class through the problem step by step, making sure everyone was on the same page before continuing.","By having learning modules that provide you with the information before each class and then going over it in class, I feel confident that even if the module was confusing I still can clear any confusion during class","She has aways given us time to practice problems and stop and think abt the question","We will review concepts from previous classes. Also, there are many online resources for reviewing content.","Most times before we answer a question as a class or move on from a current topic, I feel as if I have grasped it adequately. A few times, however, I feel like we have moved on without my understanding being clear. This is never a big issue though, and I haven't asked clarifying questions before, so the teacher has no real way of knowing.","She gives us time to work on the questions and does them with us after","Quiz content is a bit ambiguous because although question types should ideally be followed, most times, not all the class content is covered. Therefore, there are typically modifications to content on quizzes. Unfortunately, that content isn't ever brought back up and it is up to the student to quiz oneself and learn the material before the exam.","During classes, we answer questions as a class. She gives us a [Removed] of class time to answer questions.","She reviews heavily but there is so much content that it is hard for her to pause and make sure everyone in the 500 lecture class understands.

Then before proceeding to the following question will ask if we understand the reasoning or if we have anymore questions.","She always stops and asks if we understand stuff before moving on and makes sure to look all over the room.","In multiple occasions our professor has stopped lecturing to ask the class if we understand a certain topic. She'll wait a couple of seconds for anyone to respond and then we'll move on.","The instructor provides a \" muddiest point \" question in which she asks everyone what they were most confused about the week prior. Sometimes, she will then go over it again, but she will always post a document with all of them and go over that.","There are many instances in which professor thijis made sure that we were understanding the material that was being covered. The main moments that she did this was during the instpolls. The instpolls were always over material we had just gone over and if there was a minor variation from the correct answer she would make sure to explain the answer and why the others were wrong.","Verbally clarified with the class before moving on to the next topic","My instructor always asks multiple times if there are questions, and I have heard her explain the topics over and over, no matter how many times the same types of questions were asked. Also, she asks us what the \" muddiest point \" of the lecture topics were before we move onto the next week of class, and creates a sheet further explaining these points so no one gets left behind.","Experiences I am thinking about are when the instructor asks if anyone has any questions before moving on to the next [Removed]. This happens every other week or so.","She made sure we didn't have questions after a specific part of each lecture and even after the instapolls she asked us if we had any questions","Everyday, the instructor does [Removed] that cover the previous slide's material before moving on to another subject or continuing with the same subject.","Simply asking if anyone has any questions on each topic before moving on, and whenever such an opportunity arises, teaching the class about the nature of the question and its answer.","She asks that class to write down a topic from the last week that is still not fully understood, and then she sends out a detailed explanation on that topic later.","[Removed] conducts discussion sections in a way that ensures students are understanding the material.","At every lecture she has a lecture handout related to the material we are learning to get us to work with other students. Once she sees most people are done she will go over the answers with us as a class and if she sees some of us don't understand she will continue to explain it or asks us to see her for office hours.","Once she finishes a part of the lecture, she'll ask us if we understand and to ask her any questions we may have.","The professor gives us small questions to answer during class. The teacher explains and asks us if we understand, if not she goes over it again.","I feel its too big of a lecture to adhere to every student even if they don't understand the material. That s why office hours are provided for those students to understand at their own pace.","She gives us time in between concepts covered to think about what we've just learned. This happens every lecture. She'll have us actively participate via daily quizzes.","She asks students if they have any questions. She then answers the questions and goes out of her way. Sometimes she takes too long because she s too nice.","I couldn't understand one question on squarecap and she explained it to the whole class to measure that everyone understands.","We were discussing falling objects and projectile motion a few weeks ago. There was an in - class quiz question she posted for us to solve with our classmates. When the time was up, she asked the class what we picked, and the answer was split between 2 choices. She carefully went through the process and highlighted key points in the question and reiterated important concepts of projectile motion to help slowly guide everyone to the correct answer.","Dr. [Removed] is always asking students if they have questions during lecture. She is consistently checking in with students to make sure no one is confused.","Most topics have an associated quiz in class. She goes over the quiz question and asks if there are any other questions on the topics.","I know that [Removed] does this because after each and every single topic, she will ask the class if they have any lingering questions about the material. When somebody asks, no question is a bad question and she treats each question with a well thought out answer","She checks for understanding by asking us questions and writing out reasoning. She does this very often.","Every time she explains a topic especially a new one, she'll always pauses and ask us if we understand before moving on, and if we don't, then she spends more time explaining it.","she asks if we understand the answers to the [Removed] class quiz question","She waited for students to answer and would try to give hints / help if there was silence.","she asks if everyone understood before moving on","I think offering retakes for the exams and displaying the average in comparison to the original exam scores is a way to judge if most understood the material covered in that exam","I feel like she doesn't really do this just because of the amount of time we have but if someone ask a question she will go back and try and explain the topic to the best of her ability.","She always asks if we understood and answer everyone's questions until it is thoroughly explained.","She always asks if we have any questions multiple times throughout the lecture.","After each question or new concept, Dr. [Removed] would open the floor to any questions students had and wouldn't move on until either people had their questions answered or there weren't any questions being asked.","During our daily polls the professor always ask if we have any questions and makes sure to answer all of them before moving on.","Dr. [Removed], after big topics/ before a shift in topics always gives a question via instapoll. He gives lots of time for us to answer, and progressively gives hints after some time to help us naturally arrive at our own conclusions.","Every topic change, he prompts the class with \" any questions \" and he gives out in class quizzes regularly and monitors the distribution.","Does help sessions.","We do class questions on the current topic. If the class average for the question is high, he moves on because he has reason to believe that we understand the topic.","The teacher provides [Removed] questions to test whether or not students understand the concepts discussed, typically after he has finished discussing a sub - topic. He helps students answer the question, as well as going over the answer afterwards and why its the answer.","Every class, he puts up [Removed] questions that relate to the topic he discusses in class. He then goes over the results and clarifies any concepts or questions that people might have got wrong.","The professor is always asking to see if we have questions during his lecture to make sure we are all on the same page.","every lectured we get instapolls about current topics we are learning about in the form of multiple choice questions. he gives hints / advice if a lot of people are getting it wrong and gives us time think about it and get it right before moving on","He does instapolls to make sure you understand what's going on in class. Also looks for us to ask questions as well","He will ask [Removed] questions to recap topics we have just learned and he will make sure the [Removed] grade is at 90 % or above for the right answer to make sure everyone gets it. If the [Removed] score is low he helps explain the concepts to us. This happens every class.","Unsure.","He gives out instapoll questions in class to see if we understand the topic.","After and during lecture material, the professor sends out an instapol and walks us through the process to the right answer without giving the answer away.","He makes sure that at least 90 % of students get the question right on instapoll by guiding us through the questions. He also encourages us to talk to our neighbors to collaborate and ask for help.","In almost every class, Dr. [Removed] will explain a topic then wait for questions. Even if no one has a question immediately, he will ensure that people understand what he just explained, whether a formula, a concept, or an example.","Our instructor will always open the floor to questions after each topic discussed in class or after each question that we have worked on. This can happen up to 3 - 4 times per lecture and it's been very useful.","We always have ~5 minutes to try to solve the warm - up problem ourselves. The professor also stops periodically to check for any student questions.","He always brings up questions regarding the homework for the week and what topics came up most during the discussion sections. He then makes sure to address additional problems that apply said topics and makes sure to map out every step along the way during his lectures. He then answers any lingering questions until promptly moving on where any reserved student can then have the chance to ask their questions during office hours or on [Removed] Discussion.","The professor will not move on from a topic unless he is 100 % sure everyone is comfortable with the information given. This happens every day in lecture. The professor asks if anybody has any questions/ concerns, and answers all questions. He waits about 30 seconds, looking around the class for questions, before moving on to the next topic.","When covering problems and new content during class, the instructor will frequently open the floor to anybody who has questions about what was said.","After going over a particular topic or problem, the professor, [Removed] [Removed] will ask the students in the hall if they understand what he has just gone over. He waits for a while to see if any student has any questions, and if they do, he answers and is patient to answer all of the questions asked.","Even if nobody admits they don't understand, sometimes he provides an alternate perspective to a hard problem to give us the best shot at understanding","The instructor provides various opportunities for student feedback in the form of pre - lecture activities and in - class activities. For example, he asks us to read a specific section of the textbook and provide our questions on this before class. He then answers as many questions as he can ( or at least the most relevant ones ) during class. Also, he lets us discuss in - class questions and provide our answers online. Further, he asks if we understand what's going on after every single sub - topic and answers questions simultaneously during class.","He usually explicitly asks us if we understand what he explained before he moves on. Yesterday ( Oct. 2 ) he asked us if we understood a topic he explained ( i don't remember which one, something from the prelecture ) and told us to reach out since most of us nodded yes.","after every topic he takes great care to ask ( sometimes many times ) if we have understood what we just covered, and takes as much time as necessary to answer any questions we have.","When going through topics and after students have their concerns or questions about the content, she asks if any one has questions and if the topic is understood.","In class we are provided with questions and we are to answer with our fingers. She ensures that we have enough time to answer and that everyone is on board with moving on before we move on to the next topic.","When we cover new things in class, we always follow up with a handout paper related to that assignment. Dr. [Removed] always gives a couple of minutes to finish the assingment and talk it over with our neighbors. Before we go the handout she always asks if there is a general question about the handout or the topic and once she answered all the questions then we go over the handout as a class.","She has an assignment every week for content questions of the week prior and she goes over the most asked questions as well as comments on each individual's assignment answering everyone's question. If we do not do well on the instapolls after lecture, we stay on the material for a little longer","Dr. [Removed] ensures we understand the lecture worksheet questions before moving forward.","Although it is not always the professors fault, sometimes when the class is asked if they have any questions or doubts, most people stay quiet. Our instructor asks if we are okay, and she moves on to the next topic.","Dr. [Removed] gives us time to work on practice problems with our peers before we all come together and solve the problems as a class. Before moving on from each problem, she gives open time to any students who have questions or raise confusion about the content. She always makes sure to check if there is any confusion before moving on with her lecture.","She always checks up on us after each concept to make sure we are on track and is willing to answer all questions regarding the concept. Additionally, she has instapolls to check if we have understood the material and goes over it thoroughly after giving us enough time to think through the questions ourselves.","Professor [Removed] encourages discussion and questions in regular intervals ensuring the class can keep up and understand the material.","She makes sure to ask the class if we have any questions.","[Removed] questions. Asks for questions before moving on. Most of the time the questions line up very well with the material we were learning that day.","Today, Dr. [Removed] asked if there were any questions regarding the [Removed] question. Many students had different small questions about the steps to solve the problem. He took time to answer each question before moving on and made sure the student / class understood the reasoning behind each step.","I remember that we were going over a topic and Dr. [Removed] answered many questions over the topic to ensure that everyone understood it.","He makes sure to always clearly answer any questions students have before we move on.","When asking a question related to the material, we get time to think through the question on our own and talk to him and the TA's about it. When the actual answer is given, he goes through step by step how to think through those types of problems, he then checks with the class explicitly if we have anymore questions after the explanation.","During class my professor gives us time to think about the answers to the questions he asks. He also asks to make sure we understand and he pauses before continuing in case we have questions. He always says that no question is a dumb question","There aren't very many topics we go over, but she always checks in and makes sure we are good before we move on. Very engaging lectures.","When lecturing, the instructor makes sure to take time to ensure we are following along   and that we understand the important talking points of the lecture.","We all got to know each other and do little activities before moving on.","They ask questions and make sure that everyone understands the questions.","We are always asked if we have any questions before we move onto the next topic.","My instructor has always asked whether or not they would need to go over a topic before moving onto the next one to ensure we as students could grasp the topic they are teaching entirely","She asks if anyone has any questions every time","We were going over the topic of career paths that us students could pursue and after every slide our instructor took the time to ask if anyone had any questions or things they would like her to elaborate further on. Since it's such a small and comfortable room, students aren't afraid to ask questions or speak up if they're ever confused.","There's not that much materials to learn but we get to learn about different resources so it is very helpful for our success","She asks is if we have questions and provides further explanations","He has instapolls that help gauge overall student understanding, no matter the answer he goes through each one to ensure that everyone understands.","He creates [Removed], gives us time to answer, lets one person answer aloud, then reveal the correct answer.","When going through lecture he makes sure to check our understanding of the material by asking us if we understood and have any questions. When someone raises their hand, he hears their concerns and answers their questions to the best of his ability. If their questions are now answers he asks for them to give a little more insight as to what is confusing them or what information he needed to elaborate on.","The instructor will solve the questions step by step very slowly and clearly to ensure everyone follows the track. Also, she will pause for some time for students to ask questions. She will only move on to the next problem until every questions are solved.","Before we move onto the practice problems of each lecture, Dr. [Removed] asks us if we have questions about the material and ensures that we understand the material before practice problems. We are also able to stop by her drop in hours to further push our knowledge.","Whenever someone has a question in class, my professor works out the problem step by step to the class. This happens nearly everyday we have class.","She acknowledges when she goes too fast and stops to reteach. She also makes sure we always understand.","Every class, we are asked if we have questions, multiple times in fact. Whenever someone does, she makes sure she goes over it and will make sure that the student understands.","She asks if we understand before moving on.","Dr. [Removed] makes sure to give some time after talking about a new topic and asks if we have any questions every time. No matter what the question may be, she does not hesitate to answer it.","Every single lecture, the instructor will pause periodically and ask if anyone has any questions, then spend as much time as needed to answer any question that is asked. Additionally, she allows us to work independently or in groups on problems before revealing the answer, usually without the pressure of the question counting for class credit. Based on these experiences, the instructor clearly prioritizes the facilitation of a complete and thorough understanding of the material.","When the professor is explaining a difficult concept, she will pause to ask if we're following her, if it makes sense, and if she should go over it again. If she thinks we aren't understanding, she will take time to go over it again.","The instructor often pauses to see if there are any questions during lecture and especially encourages students who have not spoken yet to raise their hand. She also gauges overall understanding by having everyone answer a multiple choice questions by showing the number of the correct option with our hands.","The professor does example problems in every class. She allows the class to work on problems independently and then reviews the answers. At the end of this process, she always makes sure to ask for any questions or if the concepts make sense.","They also make sure to ask if we have any questions.","I don't remember the exact wording or time that it happened, as it has happened multiple times since the class start, but the instructors would explain the material and then ask if we had any questions before moving on. They also encourage students to jump in to answer their question before they move onto other topics.","During my [Removed] course, my instructor allows us to talk amongst each other for a few minutes and then lets us share our thoughts. She talks through what we think and then opens the room to questions, making sure they are all answered before moving on.","She made sure everyone's questions were answered and even if she moved on she would still answer any questions."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

She gives students time to practice on their own / with others before walking through and providing the correct answers.","Not exactly sure but she gives us plenty of opportunity to succeed","[Removed] asked to come to TA office hours, her office hours, and went to tutorials. This advice helped me understand better.","It's not her fault that she can't directly ask us what we don't understand, it is a very big class. I feel it is our own responsibility   to go to office hours.

Also there are lots of TAs walking around for answering questions.","She stays after class to help students.","I don't think that the instructor herself takes the time to answer questions during class, which is understandable because there are lot of students in the lecture hall. However, they are opportunities to ask question whether is the TA's office hours or in the instructors office hours as well.","She always asks if anyone has any questions and says that \" if you still have questions at the end of lectures, be sure to visit TA hours to have them answered. \"","Nobody really raises their hand and asks a question in this class. It is more of the entire class is filled with plenty of practice problems and you are able to work it out with those next to you. For example, drawing lewis structures.","Every week our professor allots plenty of time for office hours and announces additional office hour opportunities through the concurrent teaching assistants as well. Furthermore, our professor and the teaching assistants always are open to answering various questions following each lecture.","A student had a question about electronegativity and she answered and provided examples to clear things up more. it was very helpful to clear up a few things that were still foggy.","Although most of these interactions do occur virtually, she does place a strong emphasis on the importance of asking for help. She provides a variety of resources, and at the start of each class, mentions office hours and/or upcoming information that could be useful for studying.","Dr. [Removed] didn't directly ask for questions but she is so good at explaining that it felt like she was answering our questions.","During our lectures, if there were any questions that a student had, at times Dr. [Removed] would answer the question in detail but mainly I have seen at times where a student would raise there hand and a TA would answer their question individually","When students asked questions about the test I remember her answering them pretty thoroughly.","Mainly, a lot of the questions are answered by the TAs if anyone has a question due to the large class sizes. We were currently learning about [Removed] [Removed], so there were many questions asked in regard to that topic. This happens almost every class, but the most recent time that a question was asked near me was last week mainly during practice problems. Other people in the class may have has different experiences with asking questions. My instructor usually moves on with the material after some time.","The instructor herself does not answer student questions but she always encourages students to ask TA's questions. I've heard that the TA's are helpful but I've never asked them a question.","Caudill will answer questions that any students have. She will give an explanation to the whole class over this question to make sure everybody understands.","Dr. [Removed] gives time to ask questions in class. There are also TAs walking around, and often if a student raises their hand while [Removed] is speaking, a TA will come around and assist them. The TAs walk through the question, help you reach the answer, and then explain why that answer is correct.","The instructor rarely asks if we have any questions during class. If you have a question you have to ask it during office hours.","The instructor would make time for us to collaborate with other students before coming back to talk about the topic as a whole. Student collaboration would allow us to expand on each others ideas and help when needed.","She s goes over the content well and answers all the questions.","We always have about a minute or two which is reasonable for the question difficulty.","After the lecture last week, students lined up to ask Dr. [Removed] questions, to which she responded to all of them. As I didn't have any questions, I didn't go ask, so I don't know what words she said.","Our instructor assignes these instapoll questions and gives us time to respond to them. After all responses have been submitted she includes her awnser to the question and is open to responding to any questions students might have about her response.","Outside of lecture hours the instructor has office hours where they can spend more time answering student's questions for those who need more help. There is also a message board where students can post questions that can be answered by the TAs.","She always asks if we have questions and will make sure to go over it until we get it. She does this especially in [Removed]","We have breaks where the TAs can help us","After instapolls usually","Stuff","When first discussing a new concept in regards to thermodynamics, multiple examples were given about how to do the problems, step - by - step instructions, and common misconceptions. Experiences like this happen often when first introduced into new topics.","When she goes through the notes, there are frequent practice questions. She takes a bit to let students talk amongst themselves and try to figure out the answer.","If someone asks a question during lecture she will take the time to answer their question in front of everyone. I m not sure how often this happens, because people don't ask questions during lecture that often.","Students hardly ever ask questions in class. Usually when a student has a question she would answer them, but not for the whole class to hear, she usually refers students to the TA so we can move on to the next topic.","It happens in office hours. Dr. [Removed] always answers students' questions in office hours.","Dr. [Removed] holds very large class sizes, so it is difficult to asks questions during class. However, she made a system where officer hours or eddisscusion are tools to get those questions answered.","Not sure","She just makes sure that she has enough time to answer the questions we have. Makes sure that we understand before moving on.","Typically in this course we are lectured and asked questions where we have time to independently think about a topic. If a student decides to raise their hand, Dr. [Removed] will provide the opportunity for said student to ask. Otherwise, office hours are a great time for this to be done.","Dr. [Removed] answers questions in lecture and [Removed] discussion actively","We were learning about atoms. She would explain and give us time to understand.","Professor has not directly answered students' questions as there isn't enough time to cover all the necessary material while also taking time to answer questions, so [Removed] answers FAQ or common questions that students may have while going through lecture. Throughout [Removed]'s [Removed] slides, she stops and gives example problems to help further flesh out content and address any questions. This has frequently throughout each lecture.","This does not necessarily happen in class because it is a large lecture but people are able to post questions to a discussion board that all students have access to and the professor or TA will answer students questions and clear any confusion.","When learning new content, the instructor makes sure to stop and promote group discussion among peers. Doing this leads to the answer of many questions. This occurs during most lectures.","if anyone asks a question, she makes sure to answer it fully and devote the class attention towards the question.","Although she might not answer lots of students questions during class because she is teaching a group of about 500 +, she is very good about responding to emails. And the TAs are very good about answering questions during class.","Someone was asking a question about the bond angles during our last lecture and the professor clarified the question to the class and then explained the correct answer. After, the student was satisfied with the answer and we moved on.","I can't remember the exact circumstances of this situation. Because there are a lot of students taking the course, i think it's difficult for someone to answer all students' questions.","[Removed] was used for students input in questions about an upcoming exam and the instructor asks students for any questions in between topics of the lecture as well as at the end of it","She gives time to answer your questions, however there just isn't enough time to answer your question every ones.","People do not ask questions often, but when they do she takes a moment out of lecture to address their question and go back in the slides to help better explain.","The instructor is always open to questions on [Removed] Discussion, but not usually in class.","The professor answered someone who raised their hand and took time to show another example they understood.","I can not remember a specific time. \n","N / A","In lecture, I understand that she kind of has to glaze over some things and move fast in order to get through all the material. However, I think that she does clarify things in her office hours.","In class, Dr. [Removed] allocates plenty of time for the students to answer and ask questions","Well when students have questions Professor [Removed] will answer them and if not her then a TA will ensure that you're understanding the material. I don't clearly remember what happened that the student asked a question nor do I remember what they were asking or when.","When a student asks a question, she answers it well. She even goes into detail on why sometimes.","In the course, the instructor took extra time during office hours to answer questions about an upcoming exam. This happened the week before the exam when several students were struggling with understanding the material. The instructor said, “ Let's go over this step - by - step until it makes sense, ” and broke down complex topics with detailed examples until everyone felt confident. \n\n\n\n\n","Although it doesn't happen much, she does answer any question that a student may ask during lecture.","She lets us talk amongst ourselves.","The instructor always spent a lot of time in class thoroughly explaining a concept especially if it was difficult and confusing to students.","My instructor hosted office hours and would typically entertain students questions for a short amount of time after class. I didn't attend all the office hours, but I heard from other they were helpful.","We were learning about unit 3. She opened an [Removed] with a hard question. She saw that a lot of us were struggling and made sure that we all understood.","I can't name any specific times, but anytime anyone asked a question, she would take plenty of time to answer the student's question. She would also take the topic to a deeper level and apply it to other themes of chemistry or to real life, and she would make sure her response was clear to the student before moving on.","Our teacher tells us that there are TA sessions dedicated to just answering our questions. She tells us this in most classes.","Dr. [Removed] answers questions before lecture begins, but not all students are able to have their questions answered. I have not had a question for Dr. [Removed] nor for the TAs, but I have seen a fair share of students getting their questions answered.","Caudill makes sure that the TAs go around the classroom after every major topic and discussion questions. She is also available to talk after class and during office hours.","The TAs come around to answer questions. They are very helpful because they know their stuff and help me understand.","She answers discussion boards and has weekly office hours that are very useful in providing clarity on the course materials.","Typically students do not ask questions in class, and if they do, it is to the [Removed] / TA or after class has ended. We use this tool called [Removed] where both my peers and I have asked multiple questions. I especially like this because it allows for other peers, the [Removed] / TA, and Dr. [Removed] to answer your question. And when the question is answered, there is always an in depth response that allows the student to truly understand the answer and clear up confusion.","What Dr. [Removed] does to answer student questions is use the \" chatter \" platform to allow for question and answers to be posted for all students in [Removed] 301. This was set up at the start of the semester and continues to be a good resource I use. She also goes over commonly missed questions and concepts in lecture.","The instructor has provided a resource allowing students to openly ask questions about the course, materials, and course structure and have it be answered by either the instructor herself, teaching assistants, or other students. Although this method does not guarantee a thorough answer or even and answer at all from the instructor, it is still a helpful resource.","When she is asked a question, which she will spend time explaining it. This happened a lot at the beginning of the course.","Most students do not ask questions during lectures. However, when they do, she answers them and makes sure the entire class hears it.","After a student asked a question related to the lecture material, Dr. [Removed] spent a couple of minutes answering the question and ensuring the topic was completely understood. This was around two weeks ago, before our first final exam. She included drawn images to back what she was explaining, as well as notating on the slides ( I believe the question was about orbitals, so she drew the orbital notation ).","In our course, the instructor is always taking the time to answer students' questions during class and office hours. This was especially shown when a lot of people struggled with complex modules and she was able to thoroughly answer the questions.","The instructor had time for questions after each bundle of slides. She waited for all the hands to go down and then moved on to the next slide.","She definitely answers the questions but never stops to field questions.","My instructor always stays after class in case students have questions about the lecture material or about anything else! This is mostly an everyday thing.","Dr. [Removed] would use [Removed] Discussion to answer questions promptly. She would also address these questions during class sometimes.","She helps students with any questions they ask. She also goes through multiple practice problems in class to ensure students know the material.","Dr. [Removed] usually asks the class if we have any questions. if we do, she answers them positively and thoroughly.","The teacher asks if we understand and if there are no questions she will then proceed, but if there are questions she will try to explain. Also the TAs are always helpful in answering questions as well.","Professor [Removed] is very patient and lets us students think and try to answer the question before she shows us the answer to help us be able to think and solve it without her help. She has been doing this mostly every lecture.","Although many people don't raise their hands in lecture, if they do, [Removed] is more than willing to answer and simplify the material before moving on. This has only happened a handful of times, but it is clear that she is willing to answer questions during the lecture.","She would go over questions she asked and made sure everyone understood how to answer them.","The instructor would take most asked questions and explain them on the big screen in slow steps while making the problem more understandable.","She will extend her office hour if she can not finish answering students' questions","We learn the topic and do practice questions. She allows the TAs to answer questions. Gives a good amount of time and lets everyone discuss.","Dr. [Removed] took extra time to answer students' questions in the [Removed] Discussion and Office Hours. After lectures like stoichiometry or anything we might've needed extra practice on, she told us to attend her office hours so we could get more clarity.","Not a lot of students ask questions during lecture, but they do in [Removed] and it is always answered thoroughly. Also TAs do a great job answering questions during the lecture.","We ask questions during office hours","We often have instapolls in class to test our understanding of material. Often after an instapoll, a student(s ) will have a question and to that either a TA or Dr. [Removed] will respond and thoroughly answer the question.","If anyone has questions Dr. [Removed] makes sure to answer them.","Although I do not usually attend office hours, I understand that is where students can get their questions answered. Additionally, there is another site provided where students can text and receive answers to their questions.","She will either answer your questions during class if there is time and if there isn't or you still need clarification, she will speak to you directly after or during office hours if need be,","My instructor will allow us time to independently try the problems during lectures. Then, the instructor will review what to think about when solving the practice problems.","She would give us a little bit of time when asking questions in class. But for quizzes then she'll give it to us for like 15 minutes.","When talking about morphology for example, the instructor waited for student responses before telling us the answers.","The TA, [Removed], was very helpful in clearing up clarifying any details of the lab procedure and made sure that each table was doing well in performing the research techniques. She also helped us with understanding what was going on with the bacteria colonies, such as pointing out possible indications of the bacteria colony morphologies.","This would occur after the broad explanation of the procedure for the day. After the instructor explained anything she would ask if we have any questions.","yes, they answer questions. There isin't anything difficult about this lab except for the unreasonable busy work and strictness on getting an A","[Removed] makes sure to ask if anyone has questions and checks if people understand his answer before moving on.","During labs, they are always available to answer any questions me or my group may have.","She is very active over canvas and responds to students as needed. But, I haven't seen her in the actual lab itself.","Whenever a lab procedure needed to be explained, [Removed] always made sure to explain it in detail before we began. And while we conducted our experiments, he was always walking around, checking in on us, and being responsive to any questions we might have.","My group had a special circumstance with our bacteria where a spreader took more than 75 % of our plate and we had to create several different master plates to be able to continue our research. After asking the TA and LA what we should do, they proceeded to tell us what to do in detail and made sure we understand what was happening before we moved on to the next part.","Gives us chances to ask questions when she is explaining and is also available to us when she walks around class.","[Removed] goes around and ensures that each student can talk to her about lab and update her on what s happening.","When we were confused on any aspect of the lab or wanted some input from her on a plate she would take time to answer our questions and provide her thoughts. This happens almost every time we look at our plates because I like to receive input on what she thinks of the plate and how our group should move forward with a specific colony of bacteria.","Our instructor provides us with all the knowledge to understand the material and ask if we have any questions at the end of the lectures.","I was confused on how to spread the culture about 2 weeks ago. [Removed] immediately came over and explained it to me","When we ask a question she will stay at the table as long as possible to answer the question until we understand.","I have asked questions and my TA answered them.","Every time we do a lab procedure, [Removed] makes sure that everyone understands the task at hand. This happens at multiple times a class.","We spend time at the beginning of the lab section discussing questions or difficulties encountered while answering prelab questions","Whenever there is a doubt about how somethign was graded or what we should be doing we were always given an answer to our question. We were never left confused","My lab instructor will ask questions about the current lab in class and give us time to respond. She then explains the concepts and ensures the whole class understands it. She also often states that if we are confused we should not hesitate to ask","While we are conducting our lab assignments for the day, our instructor will walk around and answer any questions a student may have. If I had a question about a step I did not understand, she would lead me in the right direction.","My TA [Removed] would periodically spend some time at the end of lab opening up the floor for us to ask any questions we had about what we did that day and how it correlates to the bigger picture of the class.","If the TA asks us a question, he asks to think about why this might occur or why it is necessary. This helps us learn the reason for why these biological processes occur and how to apply our knowledge regarding what we know about them.","Our TA ryan would stand up at the front of the class and allocate 10 minutes of class to doing Q&amp;A sessions. This helped strengthen our understanding of material and help make what we were doing in the lab more clear.","The instructor asked us questions to test our understanding of the content. Just this past week before the quiz our instructor asked us if we wanted to go over anything. They asked \" Does anyone have anything they want me to explain or go over \" and they paused for a long time to give people a chance to ask. They have done this on multiple occasions throughout the semster.","Avery answers questions when we have them","They were very informative and engaging","This usually occurs after each lab objective is presented, where my TA will ask the class if there are any questions. She even goes the extra mile if no one has questions to give tips on how to understand what we are learning.","[Removed] mainly walks around the lab making sure that all of us are doing the lab procedures are right and he's always there to help us with anything that we're unsure about. Since a lot of these procedures take steps that we've never done before and are easily prone to mistakes, he does a good job at giving us tips to avoid common mistakes and answer any questions that we have on them.","Our TA, [Removed], was answering questions related to our in - person experiments. She was confirming whether or not we were on the right track with our experiments.","During a weekly Q&amp;A session, our instructor dedicated extra time to address all our questions about a complex assignment. They encouraged us to ask anything, stating, \" I want to ensure everyone feels clear and confident moving forward, \" and they patiently unpacked each question, providing detailed explanations and examples. This approach not only clarified our doubts but also created an open atmosphere where we felt comfortable seeking help.","Mrs. Hall corrects herself if something is not clarified enough by repeating it to the entire class. She gathers the classes attention by waiting until were silent so we can hear her clearly.","During instructional periods, they always allocated an adequate amount of time towards letting students discuss and ask questions about the instructions. Along with this, we also have long periods of time where we have to paraphrase the experiment in our lab notebooks. The instructors often roamed around the classroom answering questions at this time.","The instructor always asks us if we need help and if we have any questions and makes sure to answer them.","There was a question when selecting what colonies my group should put together in our combined master plate. [Removed] went to every table and helped us pick out the colonies that we should subculture and allowed us to ask questions then.","When students have questions about the experiments, deeper questions about the science behind experiments, or any general question I feel like the instructor does answer these questions thoroughly.","This, I believe, occurred during each lab where a TA would visit each table and inquire if anyone was unsure about anything.","The TA will go over instructions for the lab before we start. If we have any questions, she will go to our table and she has always been helpful in answering questions and clarifying instructions.","Sawyer always takes the time to answer our questions. For example, on Tuesday, I was confused about which plates were being used for the co - culture plates, and she took the time to explain it to me multiple times because I was confused.","Before every lab, the instructor would go over all the instructions for the day and ask if there were any questions. When students asked, she would answer them thoroughly before we began the lab for that day.","TA [Removed] is very helpful and will walk around the room and answer everyone's question without getting frustrated. If you are struggling, he will walk you through the steps until you thoroughly know what you are doing","When questions are asked at the beginning of the lab, when reviewing material for the day, the instructor will answer the question, explain it, and make sure everyone understands before moving on.

Dr. [Removed] will typically do this each class, as well as ask if there are any questions at the end.","Although our class is short, Dr. [Removed] does a good job at making sure he answers questions. It seems like he plans for certain questions and creates his lectures around where our curiosity would naturally go.","During class, students will raise their hands and Dr. [Removed] will answer them in thoroughly with examples, experiments / models / and alternate explanations. Dr. [Removed] usually puts a lot of thought into answering these questions and getting us to understand the concept and answer to the question asked.","Every class the professor stays back to answer questions, along with his office hours and email availability.","Dr. [Removed] stops very often to see if people have questions, he does not make it seem like you are rushed but as if he truly wants to explain and want us to understand.","Class is formatted to have questions each class we need to answer, and he always asks after going over the question if the class has anymore questions or need for more clarification.","After every example he pauses and asks if there's any questions and gives students at least 15 seconds to ask questions. If there are questions he asks if the response he gave helped and if it makes sense now.","What happened was she was going through the slides and was explaining things like course switch. This happened last week, and she just said does anyone have any questions and paused and waited.","Every time we are in class, the instructor is always open to questions and does her best to answer as thoroughly as possible. Once done she verifies with the student whether or not she explained in a way they understood, and if not she will re - explain in a different way.","Each time we have questions, [Removed] and [Removed] have taken time to ask us about them and give us helpful information that clarify our questions.","Anytime that someone has a question or concern, the instructor is kind and answers them without any complaints.","She would go over the things we were learning for the day then also make sure to see if anyone had any questions.","Only very occasionally would a student raise their hand to ask a question but when they did [Removed] would take it seriously an do his best to answer it. If he didn't know the answer he would actually spend time outside of class researching it and came back with an answer.","The professor always let's student's ask questions throughout the class. This happens every class.","This happens in almost every lecture. Our instructor does a great job of making sure to take and answer students' questions throughout the class period.","My instructor takes questions from the class often. He always answers each question at length, and doesn't make anyone feel like they have asked a poor question. In my view, making sure people's questions on the material are answered seems like a priority for my professor.","If a student asks a question he has no problem pausing to answer until they communicate they understand \n","In class every day professor lets students ask questions","Whenever somebody asked a question at the end of a slide of notes Professor [Removed] would take time to address the question thoroughly. Furthermore, he would put the answer in another perspective for the student to understand either more in context with what we were currently learning or what we have learned in the past.","During lecture, students often have questions about methods used and topics covered while solving physics problems. Dr. [Removed] allows space for students to ask and answer questions free of judgement in order to better understand the material.","She always ask during lecture if we are understanding or confused about the material and allows us to ask questions","Whenever someone in class gets tripped up, she will stop and reexplain the topic of confusion. Also she does it in a different way so the material is presented in a different way.","She always makes sure to ask for any questions and answers them properly. She encourages us to be curious and ask","they always allow us to ask questions and try explaining everything to us very simple.","At the end of each group's presentation of the topic, we are meant to ask the class some discussion questions based on the week's required reading. The professors make sure to let us answer the questions initially and then offer their own perspectives on the presented discussion questions.","This is also shown in the instapolls as he allows us to think independently and if we need any help they can go to office hours.","Dr. [Removed] often spends time answering questions either during or after class, making sure to thoroughly explain what is being taught in the lecture.","Before exams, Dr. [Removed] has review sections. These are opportunities to ask any questions about any of the recently assigned [Removed] homework. He defines the problem, explains the approach to solving the problem, and how the final answer to the problem is determined.","The instructor cares about what we have to say. She wants us to know that if we want to know the answer to something, she will provide us with exactly what we need to know."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

my [Removed] chemistry course, the instructor informed us that we had the ability to retake two of the four exams on the midterm date if life events disrupted our performance. The instructor said, \" You can retake up to two exams during the midterm retake session, so don't stress too much if things don't go as planned. \" This policy gave students flexibility while ensuring they had a fair chance to improve their scores.","This happened during the first week of class. I am mostly referring to when Dr. [Removed] went over the syllabus with us","To go to somewhere on [Removed] multiple times before exam time/","It is written in the syllabus that we went over at the beginning of the year and the instructor drops a few assignments in case a student misses them in case of an emergency.","Stated in the syllabus","She allows for retest when things go south. Or she's very understanding about our situations.","We have clear syllabus of this subject. Every term shows clearly, and we can ask our confusions on \" [Removed] \" so that professor and TAs can response us as soon as possible.","At the beginning of the year, my instructor went over the syllabus that provided details about late policy and rescheduled test days, mainly in correlation to religion. She wanted to make sure that everyone would be accommodated for test times, and know of them at the beginning of the year.","I haven't had any personal experiences with late assignments or missed exams, but the instructor syllabus states that there are \" in general, there are no make - up exams. \" However, the instructor also states in the syllabus, \" you will have the opportunity to take up to two 200 - point Replacement There is no cumulative final exam in this class. And if you score higher on this Replacement Exam, your higher score will replace your original Unit Exam score. \"","She talked about late work before the last test we took about 2 weeks ago. She discussed this the Monday before the test, before the material began.","The syllabus outlined information above. It is always available on canvas. We went over it on the first day.","I believe she talked about it at the beginning of the semester when we were going through the syllabus and the late policy came up. Another time she mentioned it was before or after the first exam, encouraging us to approach her in case something in our lives disrupted us taking the exam.","The instruction were included on the syllabus.","The policies are clearly in the syllabus and can be referenced. She has mentioned to reach out to her or a TA if any life events that impede coursework occur.","The professor has it on her syllabus. She mentioned this at the beginning of the course.","The professor tells the whole class that there is wiggle room for any emergency that pops up. She understands that a lot of the students have a life outside of school and that there are many thing that could unexpectedly happen. I believe she told us this either this week or last week.","My instructor has a slide in her presentation for every class that includes general announcements. Often, there are times where this specific slide will mention policies for late assignments or make - up exams, and my instructor will go into detail on where to find the complete answer to these types of questions.","It was the beginning of the semester where [Removed] mentioned everything that was on the syllabus. She continues to tell us to read the syllabus if we have any concerns or questions over the policies.","The professor made sure we read the syllabus, in which explains late polices and other rules with the context. Recently during an exam she made sure to double down on the established, and if we needed help rearranging things to email her and the teaching staff.","On syllabus day, Dr. [Removed] went over her policies for late work and missed exams. She repeats this policy at least once a week, saying \" If you have something come up or need a break for mental health reasons \" then email her and she will help you fill out the appropriate form to ensure that the absence doesn't affect your grades. Dr. [Removed] doesn't want her students' grades in the class to burden them mentally and is reasonable with not letting a minor absence tremendously impact their grade aside from most of their performance in class.","This happened at the beginning of the course. Dr [Removed] read the syllabus and said what her policy was","Dr. [Removed] made her late policies and exam procedures very clear in the beginning of the semester.","Dr. [Removed] allows us to retake our two lowest exam grades, so even if you get sick or have an emergency on test day, there's always a backup exam to help restore your grade.","Everything is outlined super clearly on the syllabus","At the beginning of the semester, we went through the syllabus, and it was stated how and when to make up exams. Additionally, before each exam, it is spoken when and how we should make up any missed exams, or exams with poor performance.","It's all in the syllabus.","they reminded studetns","Occasionally in class the professor will mention the due dates for our assignments. She will also clarify the latest date that she is willing to take a particular assignment.","She talks about the policy if there is any external issues occuring, and to talk to her and the TA for help. She mentions that the main policy is pinned on our [Removed] discussion, so we can refer to that when she doesn't refer to it in class.","Even if the modules are past the due date, Dr. [Removed] said the student can still get the full credit until the test day.","She always emphasizes due dates and dealines.","There are specific things listed on the syllabus that describe what to do if you miss a certain assignment","Dr. [Removed] mostly talks about the policies for late assignments or missed exams especially when the exam is coming up. I remember her talking about late assignments and how they are on time until the exam ends. This was helpful to me because I was able to have at least one more day to do the assignment. The quizzes however she has not really talked about if you've happened to miss them but I'm sure it's in the syllabus.","The syllabus was reviewed as a group and the policy for such occasions was clearly stated by the instructor. This occurred as a reminder after the first month of class had passed to make sure we were aware.","The syllabus states very clearly the late policy for assignments and for extraordinary concerns.","During the beginning of the semester, Prof [Removed] went over the syllabus and policies extensively.","This information is in the syllabus","Tells us very clearly when things are due","Did not have policy for missed exams or quizzes, when I was sick I was told I would get a 0 on my quiz, which is fine as it is dropped but its quite unfair regardless.","Dr. [Removed] let our class know that the learning modules can be completed at any point prior to that lesson's exam.","The syllabus states the due dates and the instructor reminds us on canvas.","I don't remember this being mentioned.","She does this before every class. There is always a slide starting with helpful information to start us off.","The professor posted the late work policy in the syllabus. This happened at the beginning of the year and was mentioned in class.","She explained how we are able to makeup exams and replace the grade with a new one.","The policies are clearly written in the syllabus","We have clear deadlines for our weekly modules. They are due before lectures to help us come to class with a base.","n / a","The professor mention that if anyone have an emergency that they have to miss class quizzes / exam, can email her and the TAs to figure out the time to make up the missing assignment","This is all listed in the syllabus in detail. I think she was my first professor to post this information.","We have clear deadlines and agendas for each class","The professor has said that students need to communicate before hand if they know something is coming up. Or, if incase of emergency to email the professor or TAs.","I haven't had the experience myself, but the guidelines were made clear the first day when the syllabus was reviewed. The rules are very clear and easy to follow.","Dr. [Removed] clearly outlines in the syllabus her policies for late assignments or missed exams when life events disrupt students' coursework. This is helpful because it can always be referred back to.","At the beginning of the term she told us when reviewing the syllabus.","During the beginning of the semester, Dr. [Removed] set clear expectations for the submission of late assignments and any situation that may have led to this. She also ensures that we are reminded of these rules a week before an exam occurs.","During the first day, Dr. [Removed] went over the syllabus. She outlines late work and makeup policies during the syllabus overview.","The learning modules if not done before next class will still be accepted but with deductions. Missed exams however have not been an issue for me.","Week after unit 1 exam.","Before and after our unit exam, my instructor emphasized opportunities if we were unable to do the exam or if we did not receive a satisfactory grade. In terms of assignments such as [Removed] or Learning Modules, she clarified in class and on [Removed] Discussion of the deadlines and that a certain number of grades are dropped.","They mentioned that we as students should contact the TA's or instructor if anything outside of the classroom as happened. There is also a syllabus referring to this late work and course policy","This professor's policies for late assignments or missed exams are stated in the course syllabus. I feel like the professor is fair and understanding.","it is provided in the syllabus, but she is also willing to discuss any issues if happened","My instructor drops 4 lowest quiz grade so if you aren't able to go to that quiz and get a 0 then she will drop that grade, and you are also able to remake 2 unit exams by the end of the semester. She explained this in the beginning of the semester.","The syllabus mentioned how to handle missing exams and probably late work too when I read it. It's pretty clear on there.","During the first lecture of the course, the professor stated that the quizzes and tests would be in class, and with the learning modules, the professor would tell us to try and get them done before every lecture. The professor wrote on their first lecture day slides that there would be optional replacement exams. This is all I can recall and easily find on my professor's canvas that might relate to late assignments / missed exams when life events disrupt students' coursework.","If you missed an exam there is an opportunity to take a replacement exam during the final exam time. There are no makeups for missed quizzes.","It was during the start of the lecture right after we took our test. Dr. [Removed] mentioned that those who missed the exam can reach out to a TA, and accommodations would be made based on the reasoning.","I believe my instructor went over this at the start of the year like on the first day of class. But that was a couple weeks ago so I don't remember clearly. If I have any questions, I just look at the syllabus.","The instructor has clear deadlines and expectations for assignments and tests.","In our course, the instructor established clear policies for handling late assignments and missed exams due to unforeseen life events, which were outlined in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester. She emphasized, both in written form and during class announcements, that no retakes would be permitted unless a valid excuse was submitted and approved in advance. This policy was consistently enforced throughout the term, ensuring fairness and transparency for all students.","Our teacher allows us two test retakes for the semester so that if we feel we did not perform as well as we would have liked then we can retake the tests.","At the beginning of the term she went over policies, and answered any questions students have. She also set up a program that allows students to ask peers, TAs, and her anything they want concerning the course.","Beginning of the course, was very clear about policies though most policies for late assignments or missed exams are similar","There are clear contingencies for emergencies. [Removed] isn't permitted but tragic or immediate events are accommodated in the syllabus.","There are clear policies stated in the syllabus.","On the very first day of class, the professor went over the syllabus. During the middle of the lecture, we reached the portion of the syllabus that went over the professor's late policies.

We were also made aware of these policies through the syllabus and can always go back and access it.","In last week's lab we took our first Quiz for the course. In the following class period, the instructor reminded us to communicate with her or a TA if we, for some reason, missed our quiz.","In the first week or day of school she explained the syllabus and thoroughly told us what was expected. She still has it in her syllabus for whenever we want to go back to it.","In the syllabus, she clearly outlined the due dates and the consequences if these due dates were violated.","She makes it very clear to email her in order to arrange the proper needs in order to make up an assignment. These events can vary but she is very lenient with that grading policy.","There is a very clear syllabus for this course, including the late work policies. Students also had to complete a quiz in order to prove that they read the syllabus, so all students should be aware of the policies.","At the start of each class, the professor makes sure to go over what is expected to have been completed as well as things to look forward to or expect to be coming up. We are also then reminded of big picture things to keep in mind as almost a \" semester goal \".","The professor has a respect and understanding for the students. A policy I am aware of is late homework. Even if the deadline is at 7 pm, there is a grace period in which the assignments can be turned in and still be graded.","She sends out a weekly information announcement telling us that week's summary.","I do not remember when the instructor went over this part of the syllabus.","Professor [Removed] has her policies of late assignments or missed assignments clear on the syllabus.","The late policies are in the syllabus.","The instructor allowed a grace period for homeworks but still clearly stated the new deadline","Details the grace period for hw submissions and the late policy for other assignments","The course has clear reoccurring deadlines that make it easy to know when you are expected to turn in assignments.

Other than that, we are expected to contact her for any life disruptions. I haven't experienced that so I don't have much knowledge on that.","We have discussed policies for late assignments as it is on the syllabus. We also got the chance to reschedule our exam a week in advance if we knew any conflicts would be coming up.","She told us about her late assignments and missed exam policies and they are in the syllabus if anyone forgets. This happened during the first week of school and has made sure that before our first test students who need extra accomidations knew where to go and to make sure they received them.","This was addressed initially when we began the course, but has not really been addressed since. Dr. [Removed] does have an open door policy about her and is actually a professor that I have felt the most comfortable approaching about problems. I have approached her and the TAs in the past about questions that I had, but it is not something that is continuously brought up or encouraged.","Unfortunately, I have been ill many times this semester, but I am able to make up my attendance points by completing another assignment!! Very thankful. We are also always given the option to reschedule our midterms if we have a time conflict.","The policies are listed in the syllabus. The TA's also are knowledgable for any questions I have regarding absences.","On syllabus day we all sat down and the professor walked us through what was expected with the class and the guidelines to follow. We even did a group activity on the first day of class to make sure we all understood the policies.","I am not sure, I don't think the instructor ever gave us clear instructions on if you miss exams or assignments due to life events?","The late policy or missed exams policy can be found in the syllabus.

She mentions that excused absences are acceptable as late work.","it is stated in the syllabus","She talked about exology note 2 and how it is due","Dr. [Removed] sends out announcements before every midterm reminding students to fill out the exam conflict form she's provided if you have another exam at the exam time or just can't take the exam. This week in class, she encouraged everybody to check their final exam schedule and get accommodations for those as soon as you can because those spots fill up quickly.","Explained in Syllabus","Dr. [Removed]'s syllabus is well made and she has written down all the policies for late assignments or missed exams when life events disrupt students' coursework. She has particularly emphasized multiple times on what we need to have our test rescheduled if certain life events or labs interfere with normal test time. During test week, she would talk about this policy over and over again to make sure every student hears and understands it.","Always write announcements at the beginning of every lecture and reminds us verbally.","She has make up exams.","in the syllabus, and all deadlines are on the quest assignments","Dr. [Removed] made it known two weeks before the exam, one week before the exam, and two days prior to the initial exam that attendance was required in order to qualify for the retake exam. Explicitly stating that missing the first exam without her knowing would result in a zero.","The syllabus lists policies for dropping assignments if you miss them.","All of our policies are outlined in the syllabus. If there are questions or concerns, we are encouraged to talk to her.","I had a personal situation occur at the beginning of the semester and Prof. [Removed] personally reached out regarding my assignments and attendance which allowed her to recommend me to reach out to other university offices to address my situation and place me in a better spot in terms of the class assignments and grades.","Professor [Removed] is very accommodating and has made it clear that she will work with students on specific issues is we just email her or talk to her about it. She is very understanding about everything","She's very understanding! She tries her best to help out when she cans, and if you have or had something going on, she's very approachable and will do her best to help. If there's a conflict on exam that you have proof like emergency or other classes, she will work with you to get everything sorted out. Example, for our first exam, those with accommodations were given a time to take their exams, but she sent out an announcement for them that if that time didn't work for them, to just let her know and she would figure something out,","In the beginning of the semester, she referred to the syllabus in which she addressed this. That syllabus is accessible on the [Removed] page.","Professor [Removed] clearly states in her syllabus what her policies are for late assignemnts or missed exams. Professor [Removed] is also super welcoming and approachable which allows students to feel comfortable enough to talk to her about any issues they may be having.","They are pretty clear about their expectations within the course regarding late and not submitting assignments.","in the syllabus!","Dr. [Removed] has retake exams which we are eligible to take if something goes wrong. I know a friend who missed the first one because they were sick and Dr. [Removed] let them take the retake.","Professor [Removed] always starts lectures sharing the upcoming due dates for homework, exams, surveys, etc. This often appears on the screen in the format \" HW 7 – Due Nov 4 on [Removed] \"","Professor [Removed] has policies listed out in the syllabus and will work with students if there are special circumstances","She told us since day one that if something ever comes up on exam days, to just let her know so she can work with us.

They are very generous and useful.","They set all of tha in the syllabus that you read before hand","Dr. [Removed] has stated multiple times that he gives opportunities to have lower homework grades dropped. This survey is an example of something he has given us for this week. I am sure if a life altering event were to happen he would give grace.","Every once in a while, the professor would talk about what was due in the coming days or weeks. This ranged from the learning exercises due before class or exams. Then, he would always include it by emphasizing letting him ( or the department ) know if there was an issue preventing someone from taking a test so they could be accommodated. If it was not about exams, he would emphasize taking care of yourself so you can recover mentally or physically. He said these things to tell us that it is important to always be healthy so you do not have to struggle later or struggle continuously if you are constantly working hard. Sometimes, our professor would include random things like pictures of his cats or deer he encounters with some story for us to momentarily take our minds away from all the work we were doing that week.","For exams he has makeup exams that anyone is allowed to do no questions asked. So if you are having a bad day you get to retry. Some homework and discussion grades are dropped in case things come up","The professor always had these procedures to make sure everyone has a second chance by weighting down the exams, and allowing drop - offs on [Removed]. However, for exams, it's not fair that if people truly didn't understand and do the retest just to either get the same score or under, it's like a waste of time","On the first day of class, Dr. [Removed] went over the syllabus and course policies, including his policies of dropping our two lowest HW grades, three lowest [Removed] grades, and offering re - tests for all three midterm exams. He's revisited / reminded us of these policies once or twice so far in the semester.","Generally, I've understood that if you missed an assignment, you couldn't make it up unless you had an excuse and emailed him.","He lets us know that homeworks that are not completed on time can not be submitted late.","He talks about the policies for late assignments or missed exams in the syllabus and sometimes at the beginning of class.","The professor clearly communicates that homework is due on Fridays 9 pm ( no late work accepted ) and that each test has an optional retake a week after.","Professor [Removed] has all of the policies for late work listed in his course syllabus. In the case of exams, he has an optional re - take of the same exam a week later in case you were unable to show up for the first exam.","There are always re - tests for every exam in his class. When you miss an exam, you already know when you can retake it, and he encourages you to do so.","Its listed in the syllabus","at the beginning of the course","Dr. [Removed] offers a make - up exam 1 week after each midterm, he drops our 3 lowest instapoll grades, and he drops 2 homework grades to accommodate people who have to miss classes or don't do as well on certain assignments / exams. This is clearly stated in his syllabus and he reiterates some of it in our lectures.","In the beginning of the term, [Removed] went over the syllabus in order to discuss grading and other topics concerning the course. One topic was the ability to miss discussion sessions due to medical reasons or having a second makeup exam for everyone, including those who miss the first.","Professor gives discussion drops and make up exams the week after the test.","Just clearly states that if you need accommodations or help he will work with you","So when using square cap the place for homework, late grades are used with a scale by autosubstracting the final grade of the assignment automatically. This can all be discussed ith the professor during office hours for clarification. For missed exams, I believe you must inform the professor prior to the exam to earn accomadations but if there is an undeniable life event that does not allow this a discussion with him I believe would clarify it all out.","I think this was mentioned in the first week of class when we talked about the syllabus. It was very brief and the grading structure is a little different to with the participation points and how to get them.","There is a canvas module on the course page that lets students know what to do when they've missed a lecture and how to gain credit back. This includes a short summary of the lecture that was missed which can also be found on [Removed]. I don't remember the instructor ever clearly stating in class that this option was available, but it could've slipped my mind.","It is stated online and always tells us that the homework are due on friday","During the first day, as we were reviewing the syllabus Dr. [Removed] clearly went through policies. He also let us know we were always able to look back on the syllabus or email him.","In the beginning of the course, the professor talked about what specifically we as students should do if we need to miss an exam or turn in an assignment late due to a life event. They also included this information in the syllabus. They also remind us about the policy in the days preceding exams, making it easy on students to follow the steps if needed.","Professor [Removed] provided the class with a detailed syllabus outlining all course policies prior to the first day of class. He then thoroughly covered it on the first day, allowing the class to ask questions.","The professor clearly states in class and the syllabus that if you have the possibility to warn in advance then let him know if not if its an emergency then he will be lenient.","They went over generally what would happen with missed classes and what not.","Discussion over the syllabus would be about the only time when this has been discussed in my memory. There are also some assignments where there is no time limit or that they are already solved before they are due","Dr. [Removed] has given us ways to make up attendance grades, mainly. He has policies such that students can miss classes and still make up their attendance points, which really helps those that need accommodations or have life events.","The instructor explained late policies when going over the syllabus at the beginning of the year. She continues to remind us here and there.","This is on the syllabus. I can't remember the late policy specifically, but it helps students that might be going through a situation","Dr [Removed] tells us frequently that her teaching team is here for us as long as we reach out and communicate. She is very kind and I can tell she wants all of her students to succeed. She also checks in with us at the start of most lectures asking us how we are doing and what interesting or nerve - wracking events are happening for us that week.","She allows students to submit assignments late in exchange for a point off which I feel is reasonable. She also allows for quiz to be dropped.","Each assignment on [Removed] has a set due date and a rubric outlining how many points will be lost if submitted late. There is also information over this in the class syllabus.","She will remind us that Lecture assignments are due. She will also mention that the points possible will decrease if late.","The professor reminded us of the syllabus policies on late work.","On the assignments in [Removed], there's a clear description of the late policy. Also, the TA and the professor emphasize and reiterate what the late policy on assignments is a lot.","There are clearly stated acceptable late turn ins on most assignments where i can still receive credit.","Instructor made her policies clear since the first day of class. This is constantly reassured by the multiple TA's and throughout our once a week discussion sessions.","She lets us know the deadlines for work","When it comes to submitting any assignments she always inserts a slide at the beginning of class detailing when they're due and penalties if not done / turned in on time.","it is very clearly outlined in the syllabus and every assignment says the late policy in the instructions.","Our professor is very understanding and sets clear deadlines. She is accommodating and lets us know well in advance and weeks prior to give us enough time to prepare for things.","Her syllabus is made excellently and easy to understand. Throughout the syllabus she makes her policies really clear but she also is constantly reminding us of the late policies in class and in her weekly announcements which is awesome.","There hasn't been a moment during this semester, but I know that she will drop the lowest test score at the end of the semester which would help if there were emergencies.","The professor had to cancel lecture due to illness. Because lecture did not occur, the homework was postponed to the following week.","Dr. [Removed] has implemented systems to ensure if we have reason to submit work late, miss class, or miss exams, we won't be significantly hurt in the long run.

This was specifically for people with learning disabillities.","In the first week of classes my professor respectfully encouraged students who need accomodations to reach out and get their needed assitence","I myself don't deal with this area so I don't think I'm fit to speak on it.","I know a few times my professor has mentioned attending office hours and making sure that all your accommodations are met so that when we take assessments you have everything you might need.","At the beginning of the semester, our professor discussed her willingness to accommodate to those in need of specific disability or academic accommodations. She instructed those needing accommodations to submit their necessary accommodations to a higher office so she could receive those reports and respond accordingly.","The Office of Student Disabilities was mentioned once but never again. It was only introduced at the beginning of the year.","On the first day of class when going over the syllabus, Dr. [Removed] mentioned how it was important to take advantage of the accommodations one may be allotted. Specifically reffering to [Removed]","I spoke with Dr. [Removed] after class about two weeks ago because the class size of 300 people was very overwhelming for me during quizzes. One TA informed me that headphones, something I used to block out noise, were not allowed during quizzes or tests, and this made me dread the upcoming test. She encouraged me to seek out accommodations, stating that \" there are really no downsides to having them if you need them and they will stay with you for the rest of college \", so I am in the process of doing that now.","during any lecture, Dr. [Removed] acknowledges that a topic may be hard and always encourages us to reach out to her or TAs for help. she frequently recommends her students attend office hours and community learning as well.","Every week our professor talks about utilizing office hours, and if people have accommodations, to contact them so their accommodations can be used. Being a type 1 diabetic, I have accommodations and the professor has made it very clear how to use my accommodations if needed","One of my friends has chronic [Removed] and struggles with taking the end of class quizzes every week. She mentioned this to our professor and they were able to come up with an arrangement where she can take the quizzes separately in the computer lab. This has been working out well for her!","Before our exam, our instructor reminded us no less than three times that if we needed to set up accommodations we could do so through a certain department and to please email her and let her know so that those accommodations could be set up and respected.","I personally have accommodations and I have had a very brief conversation with my instructor about it before the first exam. She was very supportive in encouraging me to talk to her about it at a better time where we could figure it out. I haven't reached out, but I already have access to extended time and she has already set up a volunteer to post their notes.","I think Dr. [Removed] stated directions on how to get accommodations for those that need it during the beginning of the course. She reminded those with accommodations to submit proper documentation with plenty of time before the first exam.","Before our first exam, the professor was giving the class some final reminders of the exam day logistics and asked anyone who was in need to special accommodations to discuss them with her after class. \n","On the first day of class, she mentioned that we could request accommodation through the Office of Student Disabilities if needed. She didn't talk much about it, but she did say that the resource is available to us.","I don't think that my instructor has explicitly mentioned the subject regarding academic accommodations out loud to the class, but in her syllabus she does make it clear that if any are needed, it is pertinent that students bring it to her attention because she does care about her students and wants them to be accommodated.","Our syllabus states that students with disabilities have academic accommodations for them. We learned this when the school year began.","In the beginning of the course the instructor gave us a list of materials that we could use if we needed help during the course. Also the instructor wants to make sure that we respect her and everyone in the classroom.","The days leading up to a test, our instructor referred to websites / people if you needed certain accomodations.","Our instructor would and have mentioned some extra time stuff but at the beginning of the semester, but not by a huge extent. She stated that ( I think ) it would be helpful to have confirmation with the Office of Student Disabilities","The professor invited students to the office to get additional help. It was very helpful for students who needed some help.","She did at the very beginning when gaining over the syllabus. I don't remember what she said but it was like \" if you have disabilities come talk to me after class \"","She made it clear to point this out for students when testing came up the second time.","She said it at the beginning of class. All i can think of","While taking quizzes she mentions syllabus and going to testing center to take quizzes","The teacher is very accommodating and allows the use of electronics for note taking in class. Additionally, the teacher or TA send reminders to students with extended time to register at the testing center to take an exam.","N / A","I am not completely certain.","During our testing and quizzing, I am mildly confident that students who could use extra time tested separately from the main testing block, however I am not sure because I was not a part of this group during testing. I can not recall if the professor actually provided accommodations, however I am inclined to say with my memory that she did. It is quite possible that she did not, and I am misremembering, however I want to say I think she provided extra time in a separate testing environment for those who needed it during our unit exam.","I haven't really heard too much about this but I know that if students needed Dr [Removed] has specified anybody with accommodations should use and contact the Office of Student [Removed]","No clue but i d assume shed be accomodating","I'm pretty sure there are guidelines for this in the syllabus. I'm not very sure she has said it since then though.","Some students need more time on exam. Before exams she would recommend the student learning center for time extensions.","After each exam, Dr. [Removed] would remind students of the other chemistry course that they can switch to if they are failing the exams. She provided the students with that other option and emphasized that it is not good or bad, but that it just is an option for people in those specific circumstances. \n","Dr. [Removed] says to use disability accommodations especially during testing times. This past month she said it multiple times because we 2 unit exams.","I'm not totally sure if this has happened because I don't have any sort of academic accommodations. However, I know if students who need extra time on exams, and they get that in this class.","not applicable to me but others are able to utilize accommodations during tests, and notetakers are available to those with accommodations.","Will make sure to point out in lecture if anyone needs to reach out for specific accommodations that it's a option open to everyone.","In the course, my professor was talking about our upcoming exam and she stated during class that “ if you have any accommodations for the exam please let them know in advance ”","Whenever there is a test that is coming up, she will talk about the normal procedure, then she will tak about what a student should do if they need certain accomodations","Whenever there is a test she mentions what those with accommodations should do.","During unit 3 and 4 lectures, she said to watch Dr. L's video on [Removed]. It happened the past few weeks.","The first few weeks of class, prior to exam one, caudill would often mention the different accomidations that can be offered, and consistenly remind students to sign up if they are in need.","My professor included in the syllabus how important it was that the students who have disability or special circu mstances are acknowledged. She makes the effort to accomadate for these students.","Almost every week Dr. [Removed] encourages us to go to office hours, use gchem, and ask questions on [Removed] discussion for help.","She encouraged students who needed testing accommodations to reach out to the testing center.","At the beginning of the year, encouraged and supported these resources","When the class first started, the instructor told everyone that they respected anyone who needed specific accommodations and would try their hardest for those people to receive such accommodations. They also asked for a note taker to take notes that would later be given to such people.","The professor went over the syllabus which had a section of the disability accommodations. This was during the first week.","This was mentioned at the beginning of the course when [Removed] and logistics are explained. The university accommodation policies were mentioned.","I remember reading a section in the syllabus that addressed students who need accommodations in their learning.","I'm pretty sure the syllabus of the course mentions the accommodations that students can use that the university offers in case a student needs help. I'm also pretty sure she mentioned some stuff regarding this on the first day of school.","Speaks about DA access prior to exams","As a student with a learning disability this professor has been super helpful with scheduling my test times and has been willing to listen at most points.","Before Unit exams, Dr. [Removed] reminds the class that those with disabilities who have testing accommodations can submit the appropriate forms to her.","Dr. [Removed] has mentioned several times that there are office ours, TAs actively walking around the room to help students, extra credit opportunities, etc. She has also told us to remember to request your academic accommodations prior to the testing date to ensure you receive the accommodations you have been issued. This has occurred several times throughout the course.","The instructor stated that there were accommodations for students that qualified for them. She stated that if they qualified they should communicate that to the TA's so they might use them for tests.","When taking tests I usually take them at the center","The professor has posted about extra time and other accommodations, but I personally have not used those resources.","My professor knows people use iPads in her class and some [Removed] users can't access the lockdown browser so she made accommodations to solve that issue.","In the beginning of the semester, like the first day of class, Professor [Removed] made sure to announce that people who need accommodations can contact her personally and she will be happy to assist.","The instructor would talk about how if you need extra assistance then you could get it through going to a extra ut thing. This happened in the beginning of the semester.","As I lack experience of the instructor having done this, I am not sure.","During the course, she said that she had some complaints regarding the noise in the class making it difficult for some students to concentrate. She then began to ask the class several times to stop whispering so that those students may concentrate. While this may not be a specific instance of accommodations, as far as I know, that was the only opportunity she had to assist one of her students with an obstacle that was inhibiting their ability to perform well in the class. Overall, she did her best to remove it.","Before the first test the professor encouraged students who needed accommodations to email a TA. She said it was to allow for their needs to be met.","I believe that she has just been pushing for the entire class as a whole to use all their resources. She makes sure everyone knows there are people one campus who want to help, and she offers herself to help in anyway that she can if needed.","Encourages to go to the testing center","The instructor makes sure to inform students about specific opportunities that they can take advantage of if they are in need.

The professor definitely respects the use of accommodations I m fairly sure yet can't be too sure because I don't know.","I believe that at the beginning of the course Dr. [Removed] mentioned to use the [Removed] office for exams. I talked to her once outside of class, and she helped tell me where I should go and who I should email.","Before each test, we've had three of them so far in class, Dr. [Removed] would always mentioned that anyone who has specific accommodations should take full use of it so that they would be able to do well on test. She also told students to reach out to those services in advance so they have all the information necessary come time for the test. I don't remember if she mentioned anything more specific than that because I don't have accommodations, but I know for sure that she's mentioned it before every single test.","I have not heard much about this but I have not asked.","The professor would mention the course switch if needed for certain students. She made it clear that we did not have to and it was only if we needed it.

The professor prioritizes this constantly.","During the course, we have a quiz every week and the instructor always says that if someone has accommodations, the quiz has been altered to fit those accommodations and some people who need to go outside to a different room are allowed to do so.","I am not a student that needs any academic accommodations or anything like that so I admit I did not pay close attention when the professor would talk about this topic. I remember at the beginning of the semester her telling students to reach out if they are in need of any academic accommodations. When the last day of accommodation letters was due she also reminded students to turn in letters also.","Before any assignments or exams, Professor [Removed] made sure to let us know we were free to talk to her about any needs for accomodations!","Our professor encourages students to take advantage of our resources.

In addition, there is one lab that is allowed to be dropped in order to accommodate for an emergency.","My TA is very supportive and nice, but I never remembering her saying to reach out for support from her if the university offices are not helping.","In my [Removed] lab course this semester, the instructor emphasized the importance of seeking help early if students feel unsupported by university offices. This was mentioned during the first week of class when the instructor encouraged us to advocate for ourselves.

This reassurance created a supportive atmosphere, encouraging students to advocate for themselves and seek guidance, which I found very helpful during tough times in college.","You should reach out to instructors they will help you."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

However, this doesn't apply to me.","I didn't see this personally, but she does talk to kids after class and explains their inquiries. The instructor said stuff such as \" I am here for you... \" and \" Let me know if you need help... \"","I don't have any significant life challenges so I can't speak on this, but I'm sure it is written in the syllabus to reach out. The TAs are also always there to discuss accommodations.","Professor would say things along the lines of : \" we are here to help and support you guys and if there are things going on in your personal life that is affecting your performance in this course, let us know and we can figure something out. \"","She quickly checks in with all her students at the beginning of most classes. She allows talking for a few minutes to the people around you about your favorite things and what you were doing this interesting weekend.","She made sure to tell our class that we can reach out to her if we need some additional help or if the help we need isn't being made accessible to us.","Dr. [Removed] regularly encourages her students to seek help from TAs and shows general care and interest in the well - being of her students.","I know that she has said multiple times that if we needed something because it impacted class we could email her. At the beginning of Monday lectures she also usually asked about our weekends.","It is found in the syllabus stated clearli","After exam 3, the professor asked for students who are struggling in the course to reach out to see how the team could help them.","Asks about what we thought about the exam and includes instapolls for feedback. She tries to incorporate that feedback to improve the course tasks / materials. Encourages us to go to office hours and any resources to succeed. She even said to go to her office hours if we are encountering any challenges.","This professor is amazing!","During lecture, she says sometimes that we might be struggling with the material but states that it's easy to comprehend if we pay attention in class and watch the videos from the other professors in the lectures online.","She directs us to the [Removed] website in case we need additional help.","Again, there have been a few instapolls asking how we are feeling and if we need extra help we can always reach out to a TA or go to office hours.","Professor always offers options to contact her or TAs.","The professor has always reached out to us on [Removed] to make sure we are taking care of ourselves and balancing out school in a healthy manner. I have felt extremely supported throughout this entire course and know that my professor is there for me both academically and emotionally,","She wanted to make sure we knew that our mental and physical health was more important than anything else and to reach out if we ever had any issues or problems.","The instructor assured us that there were resources available on campus in case significant life challenges arise. In relation to the course material, they said we could ask our classmates for help as well.","I'm not comfortable saying.","In the course, the instructor would regularly take time at the beginning of class or after major assignments to check in on students' well - being. This occurred about once every few weeks, particularly after exams or during stressful periods like midterms. The instructor often asked, \" Is anyone feeling overwhelmed or dealing with challenges outside of class? Please feel free to reach out if you need additional support or resources. \" This created a supportive atmosphere and let students know their personal challenges were acknowledged.","The professor is a lovely lady. On her way into the classroom, she asks us how we're doing.","The professor, mores so encouraged us to talk to our neighbors and talk about how our weekend was. Since the class is really big with about 3400 students, the professor can't really talk to each and every student. But the fact that the professor asks us to check in and take a few minutes to talk about it in the beginning of class makes it clear that the professor does care about our well being.","At the beginning of each lecture, [Removed] addresses certain issues that students may be experiencing and provides helpful resources. At the start of today's ( 10/2/2024 ) lecture, [Removed] informed the class of how some students who wish to drop the class may do so.","The teacher has listed on their canvas mental health resources.","She is overall very supportive of students. When I was reading the syllabus I felt very comfortable knowing that she provides grace for those who need a break and miss class.","The instructor would periodically check in with students by sending out anonymous surveys or pausing during lectures to ask if anyone was facing challenges that might affect their ability to succeed in the course. These check - ins typically occurred in almost every lecture and the instructor would say things like, \" If you're going through something difficult, please let me know, and we can discuss how to support you. \" The intention was to create a supportive environment and make sure students felt comfortable seeking help if needed.","Dr. [Removed] often provides additional lecture and practice problem resources that can be located through the [Removed] page. She makes an effort to destress and comfort students by giving time to discuss with other classmates and affirming our success.","Dr. [Removed] on the Friday's after lecture usually   send out announcements giving words of encouragement for students completing the week, stating that we can get through the semester. Dr. [Removed] also   provides   links for mental health organizations and resources for students who are having a tough time academically and beyond school.","While I think our class size would prevent us from Professor caudill doing this on a one on one level, she is very considerate of those who need support.","She provides lots of resources for this. This is mostly handled by the TAs.","Before class, there would always an introduction slides that have all the information to contact her or the TAs / UGCAs, in case of needing help with the education side. There also the crisis hot line, the office for helping counseling student so that if we need help or talk to someone we can email, text or call.","I don't remember this.","Before lecture mentioned how she is here to help us and if are going through anything you can contact her or the TAs.","She often has words of encouragement especially during exams ; telling us she believes in us and our abilities to do well. She also makes sure to state our options multiple times so we don't feel helpless. Dr. [Removed] seems to genuinely care about us and likes getting to know us.","In this course, the professor often reminds the class about her office hours and points out different resources that are available online for reviewing confusing content. The professor reminds students about these opportunities almost every week and encourages students to attend academic communities to get clarification on confusing content.","The instructor always informed where we could get additional resources to prepare for the course, specially office hours.","She has shown us the resources to use if there's an emergency and you need to be excused from classes","I had an unexpected illness. It happened 2 week ago. Very understanding an didn't hold it against me","My instructor provides us with resources for students with disabilities. Also, at the beginning of the year my instructor explained the no late work policy to us.","She takes care of students","she has many resources posted on canvas and [Removed] support.

She acknowledged the stress of exams. She emphasized that students should prioritize their well - being and seek help if needed, creating a supportive environment during a stressful time.","At the beginning and one other time so far, my professor mentioned some resources we could use in order to improve our learning experience and mental health in general.","Mindful of out of class schedules of students","When my teacher mentioned encountering difficult life challenges or additional support, I assumed she was referring to the need for mental health breaks or tutoring. This happened right after our first exam where people may have felt overwhelmed.","The Professor would start class by breaking the ice whether that be how was our weekend or what is something exciting you've done as of recently. This practically happens in every class that I've attended this year so far. The professor would also send out kind, thoughtful messages over canvas emails / announcements to make sure she's taking care of her students.","I can't remember a specific moment.","She has done this and made student study hours to also help with that.","Class size is big so checking with individual students concerns is hard.","Just does not happen.

At the beginning of the school year, she reminded us of the resources available to us and if there are any updates.","She said if struggling in chem 301 you can move down a class so you can save gpa and get better grasp and knowledge of prereqs before taking it.","Althought I am not sure if this happened, I am sure that they would do their best to accommodate for the student and help them out.","Provided open contact to communicate life emergencies.","They always said to let us know if anything was up. They were freidnly and accomodating \n","I wouldn't say [Removed] checks in with us on a personal level, but due to the labs being pretty long. She does however constantly check in with lab tables if they are stuck with procedures. \n","[Removed] provides a lot of tips on how to get through certain classes during the \" free time \" we have during lab periods. She also provides a lot of help and advice on how to do assignments that are assigned throughout the course as well as provides good clarifications on whether or not we are doing the procedures correctly during the lab.","Provides support in the syllabus","There is a section on our campus home page for accommodations if needed. There is also a section on the beginning of the syllabus encouraging us in preparation of the course.","I didn't feel as if though she checked in with us, but I felt comfortable enough to reach out. I had to step out of lab for my registration and emailed her prior and was able to be accommodated. She told me I could take my time knowing I was stressed.","My instructor always talks to all the students to see if they are doing good. I haven't really come across a scenario where the instructor needed to help a student who is encountering significant challenges, but I wouldn't doubt that the instructor would respond to that.","The instructor was very helpful in making sure everyone had the right attire and information every lab. One time when I forgot to wear pants, I was deducted points but was still able to enter lab.","Said we could email if we needed help","She would go around and check with us.

You are free to email him or talk to him after class as well.","I know that Dr. [Removed] has additional resources posted on his canvas page for any of his students that need to reach out and explain if they are going through significant life challenges. I always see him talking to students after class and he spends that   time answering their questions and posting resourceful information on [Removed] discussion. I have not personally asked him for additional support, but I would feel confident and comfortable approaching him or any of the TAs if I needed to.","He checks in with us every class period and makes it clear that he is available to help us. He also makes an [Removed] discussion every class to answer questions.","I was waiting for class to start and he asked how I was doing.   I was struggling that day with 9/11 and he gave me additional resources that could help me get through survivor's guilt.","In my course, the professor made it a point to check in with me regularly, especially after learning about my father's surgery.

This consistent outreach fosters a supportive environment where students feel comfortable sharing their struggles and seeking help. Such an approach not only builds community but also encourages students in other courses to prioritize their well - being alongside their academic responsibilities. \n\n\n\n","On the first day of the course when providing syllabus details the teacher outlined late policies.","Given that this is such a big class, I think it's moreso given to us in the syllabus and in his general teaching philosophy that we can approach him ourselves if a life circumstance comes up, and reliably get additional support.","Professor makes sure to make time in class to talk about taking care of oneself.","I don't think he did that","Dr. [Removed] generally states that everyone should be in communication in and outside of the classroom in order to achieve comradery and expand our social networks.

I can't think of a particular time I experienced this, but he has told the class since the first day","Dr. [Removed] does not individually check in with students due to the large among of students in his lecture, but he does drop 8 of the square caps in the semester in case there is something that does not allow you to go to the lecture that day.","I don't think the instructor did this. I accidently selected yes, I should have said no to this question.","He will leave an announcement with sources for help","She sends instapolls asking us on how the class is feeling regarding the difficulty of the course and talked to the individuals who were struggling with the course. She emphasized that the class won't cause you any stress and that all you need to do is practice a little bit.","At the end of the unit she askes a question to see where everyone is at in using R - [Removed] as well as understanding the class material. The instructor then conveys that if we have any worries or don't feel like we are grasping the material, to reach out to her or the TAs so that we can get help on where we are stuck.","She'd tell us to come to office hours","At least once a week, Dr. [Removed] checks in on us during Instapolls to see how we are feeling about R coding in general. She makes it clear that it is absolutely okay to reach to her or the TAs if they need any additional support in the course.","She gives us resources like TAs and office hours to help us if we need it.","She is lenient about extending deadlines and working with students when issues arise. She extends offers of help and regularly checks in on how students are feeling about their understanding of the content through polls. In the past, she has been happy to work with my accommodations to make my experience as smooth as possible.","She makes she if you are sick that you are able to stay on track. Advises us to meet in office hours for extra questions or help.","The instructor has continuously made it clear that students may come reach out with any personal issues. If much of the class is seeming stressed on assignments, the instructor will act with more flexibility.","I have not necessarily needed this service ; however, the instructor has always been very open with her time whenever I have difficulties in this course.

He would call on some people to share then he would share himself. Then he asks how everyone is doing academically and personally, by asking if we've had any test or how were doing on homework, then if anyone is doing good mentally.","Yes, each class we all have the opportunity to talk to him if we need to, or just talk about how our weeks have been since we last saw each other.","Our professors have told us to reach out when we're feeling particularly stressed or unable to manage deadlines, claiming they will work with us to help us alleviate that stress and rework deadlines.","Makes sure to ask before every lecture whether anyone needs to talk."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

This happened yesterday. The words Dr. [Removed] used during this was acknowledging that people struggle and can take these steps to save their gpa and that it was beneficial.","My professor reminds each class period about the resources that are available to use academically. This happens at the beginning of each period before she starts content. It is helpful because it reminds me to write down in my reminders app the TA hours for example when I think I need them that week.","she always posts extra material for us to study, and tells us where to find extra material. the TAs are helpful too","For every exam so far, there's only been one but we are preparing for our second, Professor [Removed] makes it very clear at the beginning of every lecture that there are multiple resources to prepare for the exams. She provides practice exams, and in our last lecture on September 30th, she mentioned this was open. Additionally today in lecture 10/2 she reminded us to review our Review Notes for the upcoming exam next Wednesday.","My professor provides guidance a lot when exams are coming up. She gives us a lot of resources provided by the school and ones that she comes up with on her own. She tells us about tutoring or anything that can be really helpful.","At the beginning of the semester, she strongly emphasized the vast resources available to us. She has continued to emphasize this by bringing up office hours, extra tutoring sessions, online resources, etc.","The instructor provided guidance on how to use academic supports available to the class or provided by the university on the first day of class. She also does send out announcements / emails encouraging us to attend the office hours / academic communities, especially when getting closer to the day of the exam. She also does encourage us to ask the TAs for help during class, if we have any questions.","Often we are told of all the academic supports that are available to us and how to take advantage of them. This happens weekly and the professor tells us about them repetitively","Dr. [Removed] constantly advises and reminds us that her office hours, the TA's office hours, academic communities, and recitations are very resourceful options to succeed in her course. Additionally, she links all sorts of textbooks, resource hubs per unit, and has an [Removed] discussion for students to collaborate","Before exams she gives us many different resources that help strenthen our understanding. She always makes sure we know that we have the TA's and office hours and academic communtites for any help we need.","On the canvas page in the beginning she explained and broke down how to look for resources that are clearly labeled and how many opportunities there are to get the help you need in many ways.","I really appreciate that the class provides learning communities and tutoring hours. I have attended some sessions, and they are very helpful. The material she also provides mirrors exactly what will be on the exam.","Professor has a canvas module with lots of resources. It's available 24/7. She is great professor.","During the beginning of most classes, Dr. [Removed] ensures us of what help exactly is offered ; at the beginning of the semester has reminded students of office hours and academic work activities that the TA's provide outside class time. The first slides also encouraged us to use the [Removed] Learning Center, and has offered links in [Removed] if we need. It's all very organized under tabs on the home page.","Towards the beginning of the semester the professor was telling us about resources for help. These were the TA office hours and the problems that they host. The professor said these would be helpful and a good practice.","When going through the syllabus, Dr. [Removed] noted some resources the university has to help us in our freshman year.","My teacher provided materials on [Removed] that helped the students know what to do. Also, during the beginning of some classes, she talks about things on [Removed] that could help students.","She posts academic supports all the time on our [Removed] page.","Dr [Removed] mentioned the [Removed] Learning Lab where students can get academic support and also her office hours and he TAs office hours. She also offers a place online to ask questions anonymously in case someone wants to get andwrts","Before class she provides examples of various resources for students for extra help.","The instructor constantly encourages us to attend academic hours ( group setting, TAs are available to answer questions ).","She always brings up when her office hours are, points out resources on the [Removed] page, and encourages us to ask questions about resources.","On multiple occasions, my professor has included additional help and links to access when students are in need of guidance. [Removed] that is from the university or even just being referenced to the class TAs.","On occasion, my professor will mention office hours ( which are also always posted on the [Removed] page ).","In my course, the instructor mainly focuses on promoting office hours as a support resource, but they haven't specifically mentioned other academic resources like the [Removed] Learning Center or tutoring services offered by the university. They encourage us to come to office hours, often saying, “ Feel free to stop by if you need extra help or have questions about the material. ”","Caudill mostly just guided the class on which resources from the readiness modules would be beneficial to review for the test. She has not talked much about university specific resources but has given a bit of guidance on course resources.","She has provided various resources such as the university lecture videos from Dr. [Removed], which are very helpful when trying to understand topics that you might be confused on.","Caudill mentions at the beginning of class various resources we can use on upcoming tests.","Dr. [Removed] has reminded everyone numerous times about the office hours and academic communities available to everyone","The instructor always asks us to prioritize mental health over this course and is extremely supportive. There was a family death during the second exam time and Dr [Removed] as well as [Removed] ( her TA ) were extremely supportive and helpful during this time.","They went over the exam preperation page that they use to post resources from the class to help our work and studying","She will always do everything in her power to make us aware of every resource.","The professor has guided us on how to use the academic support available in class and at the university. She told us at the beginning of the semester about the [Removed] Learning Center and about her office hours.","Dr. [Removed] has a whole area of our [Removed] dedicated to study materials and extra support ( especially videos ) if we feel we are still not grasping the material. She recently showed us how to take advantage of review videos made by another professor in the department that many of us did not know were uploaded since the beginning of the semester.","Dr. [Removed] have resources available on canvas.","Gave us the opportunity to go down to a lower level chem course.","She constantly reminds us about office hours and exam review sessions. She does this during class as well as through announcements.","Dr. [Removed] often tells us where to find resources that are both specific to chemistry, and resources provided by the university. She has provided us with countless resources to help us better understand what we are learning so that we can do our best on the quizzes and exams.","I remember our instructor providing guidance on how to use academic supports available in class and provided by the university, usually before exams. She will occasionally mention her, as well as the TA's office hours during the week as well as the different tutoring / review sessions available during the week.","She gave us a lot of resources to do well in the class. She gave materials for all of the question types which was really helpful","Almost every lecture, [Removed] will make an effort to emphasize office hours and recorded lecture videos. Office hours are vital to success in complex classes, and she makes an effort to remind us that they are always readily available.","In the start of the lecture, many times Dr. [Removed] mentions resources that we can use to further practice the course material. One that really sticks out to me is her mentioning the Dr. [Removed] videos that are posted every Friday that she encourages us to watch.","She often encourages us to attend office hours, TA sessions, and be active in the canva class discussions. She does this every lecture whenever we cover something that may be challenging to completely understand in the hour and a half lecture.","she constantly reminds us of office hours and where to go to find specific resources or help on a topic.","Before the first exam, Dr [Removed] stressed the importance of students going to office hours and asking the TAs any questions.","She encourages students to ask questions in office hours and go to them if we need support. Also to use the supports offered on canvas and on the [Removed] chem website.","Dr. [Removed] has mentioned on a number of occasions to be sure to talk to her or the TAs / LAs after class or during office hours to make sure that if you are uncertain on a topic, that you can get that fixed and understand it completely. While I have not participated in that yet as I have felt that I had a good understanding so far, I will be sure to use these resources in the future when we get into more difficult concepts.","Provided links and things of the nature for us to go to when we needed guidance.","On the Monday of last week during the 11 am - 12:15 pm chem lecture Dr. [Removed] stated that if students were having troubling understanding the topics on the midterm that we can attend ta office hours, as well as the sanger learning center. Also Dr. [Removed] stated the week prior to the midterm, there was a link to the exam [Removed] study guide with the topics   and approximate amount of questions that topic will have on the midterm.","Dr. [Removed] is probably the best at providing guidance on how to use academic supports, such as the question types.

It was only a simple reminder, which usually occurs during the beginning of class before the lecture material begins.","She always talks about office hours for questions every class period. She does not want to stop lessons to answer questions so usually she just says office hours.","I can not remember if the teacher for this course specifically went over it during lecture ( if she did, it would have been only the first class ), but every professor at our university has it in their syllabus. It gives you information on where to go on campus if you need academic support.","Before every unit or when things become difficult she always tells us whwen her office hours are, those of the TAs even when they hold study sessions to which we can go to that would help us.

There were also various links and articles on certain topics that we were going over in class in canvas. The professor also had the [Removed] prerequisite class transferred and linked canvas in case there was a need to refresh previous knowledge.","For chem 301 we had to take a pre - assesment to enter the class. Thanks to this we were given resources before the class even began to review foundational and prerequisite knowledge for this course.","There are academic communities and office hours opportunities. She also opened up quizzes from the chemistry readiness module.","Pretty much any time we are starting class, my professor reminds us of external resources we can use online to get a better understanding.","Before taking this course there was an assessment to test our foundational knowledge about chemistry. Whether you passed or failed the assessment there was an opportunity to go over all of the foundational knowledge a student may need for this course.","[Removed]","At the beginning of the year, the professor provided some resources for students to review the foundational basics of chemistry.

As well as gives resources where we can find more information about the question types.","The professor mentioned in class that the summer course prerequisite learning modules were on canvas. She did this two to four weeks into classes.","In our learning modules were are introduced commonly to topics not yet in the Unit but the information ties into which will help us understand information coming in the future and also topics beyond the course. There are also links to websites that goes into detail about certain topics for example in this course a website was linked in our learning modules about blackbody radiation.","From the start of the first unit and leading up to the week before the first midterm, the professor gave us modules before lecture to become familiarized and have a previous foundation before lecture. There were also practice questions, a practice exam, and review notes which give extra information on every module.","Dr [Removed] always mentions the specific topic at least so we can at least look up what we are missing. Many times, she will incorporate small reviews into the lecture and other times leave little access points on canvas.","If the learning module we were tasked with doing before that class vaguely covered a certain foundational topic that we were thought to have understood, she would be sure to review it with multiple examples in class.

She posted all of these modules after the 1st exam. She announced to the class that these would be helpful to refresh or fill in gaps of knowledge.","During lecture the instructor gave us optional modules to go through that cover chemistry readiness.","There is a 10 Module resource labeled chemistry readiness that we were required to complete to take [Removed] 301. It served as a great foundation refreshment. Our professor often referred us to this resource at the start of the course to better prepare for the information ahead. She often still tells us to revisit it throughout the course to see how our understanding back then is changing as we go through the content.","Dr. [Removed] routinely mentions the availability of the preparedness course that was provided for us over the summer in [Removed] readiness, and she makes the point that if we need extra guidance or a review of the basics to circle back to the readiness course","In this course, a link for prerequisite modules is provided at all times. Using this link we are able to review foundational knowledge that is vital in comprehending more advanced topics.","all of the prerequisite modules for this course are posted on [Removed]. students can access them to study from prior to exams","At the beginning of the semester, the instructor tell us to complete the chemistry assessment modules to get a better foundation in this course.

Even if the material seemed basic, she would still go through problems step - by - step ensuring that I understood everything without assuming prior knowledge. She also posts all of her lecture materials and answers to questions asked in lecture for study material and review throughout the unit.","Early in the year, she made it very clear about the prerequisite resources and important things to learn. She doesn't regularly recommend these resources, but she did early on.","In lecture she told us about using the chemistry readiness modules if we need to refresh on older topics of chemistry. She told us this I believe this past week however if I'm mistaken then the week before that.","Made sure everyone had completed the chemistry readiness assessment during the first week. The modules in this assessment were very helpful.","During the summer, we were required to take a [Removed] Exam, and there were optional modules given to take before the school year started. This was over the summer and was still available in the beginning of the term. These modules covered many major topics of chemistry and allowed us to practice and review while also reteaching us.","She keeps the chemistry learning modules that contain videos and practice problems from the chemistry concepts that we should know coming into [Removed] in case we need a refresher on any topic. She also does a warm - up at the beginning of each class that incorporates something we had previously learned so we can review it.","The instructor mentioned in the beginning of the semester the importance of taking the chemistry readiness assessment. This assessment reviews basic chemistry skills and provides a [Removed] course for the semester so that students can reference back.","She was just reviewing what will be on the test and went over different resources such as the question types and genchem","There are learning modules for this but I believe that they are hard to follow. it is just not the way I learn.","She has a separate folder for prerequisite knowledge we need to know. They are open all the time for practice or review.","Dr. [Removed] has referenced since day 1, their are additional resources in a variety if forms. Extra Learning modules in canvas, study materials, practice problems, and TA resources. There are a variety of forms of resources and office hours for students convivence and flexibility.","There is a resource hub for all prerequisite knowledge. Also learning modules covering the chem basics.","The professor uploads study guides and helps us define our study plan before exams. This typically happens before exams.","The instructor advised that if we were unsure about a fundamental topic that was included in a lecture, we could find review material within the courses's materials. This happened when a memorization item in more basic chemistry courses was brought up in lectures and is commonly forgotten by students.","She had available the chemistry readiness during the summer. This provided foundational resources for a lot of a students.","I was thinking about how much I would use these resources or if I would ever use them. I haven't yet tried them, but after this first exam I believe I need to start using them or I will not do as well as I want in this class.","This happened maybe during the first two weeks of school my instructor stated some prerequisites for the course. One thing she said was helpful before starting general chemistry was the canvas chemistry modules to help prepare us for the course. She also stated the chem lab was important to take and lined up pretty well with her course schedule so the lab would be helpful as well.","On our course canvas page there are helpful links to review information and prerequisite knowledge that prepare you for the course. There is information that you may have learned in high school provided in order to refresh your memory and prepare you for the information taught in class.","Dr [Removed] has posted readiness modules, outside readings, and videos for us to review past / high school material before it is tested on.","Dr. [Removed] offered prerequisite material at the beginning of the semester for the course. She recommended that students should take the time to go through and remind themselves of material and skills they have previously learned.","Dr. [Removed] provides question types as well as additional notes that can be used to self learn outside the class and even learn ahead.","She lets us know that the canvas modules that are due before class will help us understand the material we cover in lecture.","Modules","Dr. [Removed] has posted prerequisite knowledge - based modules for the course in canvas. We also have access to the chemistry quest course where we can study any prerequisite concepts that we may want to.","She has additional resources for us to look at","The instructor publishes notes from the class right after the class ends. The instructor posts question - types for the quizzes and exams before the class for the students to study.","The professor linked canvas modules for prerequisite materials. She recommended for us to go through them and take notes.","Well, it was not necessarily \" personal \" or defined by time, but they always provide weekly modules that help add to the lecture's material with questions to review over previous week content and external videos and such, alongside many other review notes.","My teacher has modules open for pre - requisite knowledge for our class, she consistently reminds us that we have materials for further guidance. These were the same modules we needed to complete before class, but she reminds us to try and retake the modules for reinforcement.","In the learning modules before class there is usually an opportunity to review prior knowledge. She also encourages us to check other resources about the prior knowledge.","She has many additional resources including free websites with readings pertaining to the class, additional learning modules that go more in depth into the topics, extra videos explaining content, and many other supplementary aides.","There was a summer assignment that we had to complete prior to this course. She has mentioned multiple times in class that we could go back and review certain portions of the assignment if we were feeling a bit lost or behind.","Dr. [Removed] said that we can use the [Removed] 301 readiness course to brush up on our basics.","On canvas, she has resources posted that helps us review the material if needed. She has websites and other resources for us.","I can't remember the specific moment, but I know she has.","This only really happened BEFORE school started. I had to do modules for chemistry to refresh my knowledge.","She provides information and resources needed for tests. She also will mention if the information we are learning comes up farther down in our academic career.","She provides the chemistry readiness assessment to test our prior knowledge. They're available all semester, but she hand picks the prior knowledge we need before exams.","Before taking the course, we had a whole canvas course on chemistry refreshers. I also feel like a lot of the canvas modules for this course briefly cover prior knowledge that we should have.","[Removed] always mentions the chem readiness modules as refreshers.","wsdhviwueOHF'wiehf;iweF","She gave us a worksheet to practice before class. I believe this was 2 days ago so 11/9/24, and the worksheet was related to thermodynamics.","My instructor provided the class with pre - chemistry modules. The modules cover what one should know before this class.","The instructor has provided learning modules to help us revise the prerequisites for this course at the very start of the term. They continue to be available for us to use at any point in the course should we need to refresh our prior learnings.","There are modules posted in canvas to help establish that knowledge if we don't have it already. They are in canvas","We have question types to study that are constantly updated. And review slides with 1 - 2 practice questions","My instructor specifically included a series of learning modules at the beginning of the course that contained both current in class material as well as some foundational material not explicitly reviewed in class. There was also a class prerequisite that required incoming students to pass an online review that went over only foundational material.","She provides learning material such as the review material or references to other resources. Overall, she does a good job of explianing the prior knowledge needed, but the extra information always helps.","Dr. [Removed] is constantly reminding us of the resources hub she has put on canvas with many different study resources.","The learning modules over summer provide us with that and we can access them at any time. She also puts in little reminders in slides as we go.","In the exam preparation folder, she adds extra notes and resources that students can use to learn more of the course.","The instructor posted the modules for the entire unit in advance, allowing students who sought to get ahead to get ahead, as they could go far beyond the current material at hand. This occurs usually at the start of every unit where the teacher posts the modules.","We have an upcoming test and as always, Dr. [Removed] provided us with pre req material for topics that we might need additional help in. She has always provided us with this material since day one and this isn't really a new thing.","On our canvas home page, my professors and others from the [Removed] faculty have created an asynchronous [Removed] page for past chemistry concepts. This allows us to brush up on old concepts that we learned in highschool to better understand the concepts taught in college.","Before the course started we were given pre assessment lectures that could help us be better prepared for the course and gave us an overview on what material we were going to experience during our freshman year.","She provides review notes that directly aligns with the exam content which makes it really easy to learn what kind of questions we will be taken on.","Learning modules are available for the prerequisite for the class, videos are offered, many resources are here to help us.","The instruction specifically provides information about the course within the syllabus. The information regarding the lessons can be found in the learning modules which I find very helpful. Every week we get three to four modules which are filled with valuable information and allow us to succeed on the quizzes and exams throughout the semester.","Before each lab, we are asked to read articles, watch videos, and review protocols for the things we are learning about. This helps to understand what we should be doing and what we need to know to be successful.","The instructor has pre - lab assignments that go into detail about what will be happening in lab for the week. The pre - lab is due an hour before the lab.","She always gives us a run - down of what to expect.

He's also generous with giving office hours.","Our instructor provided us with a few problems we can work out or practice to understand concepts or quantitative questions. This made it helpful for us to prepare for our upcoming exams.","He would quickly skim over the topics that were required before this. He would then refer to it and say it was in the textbook.","He had homework over basic geometry stuff. Although prequisite knowledge wasn't really taught.","He gave us plenty of information and resources to help study for our exam.","The instructor offers plenty of office hours with himself and TAs and there's a free textbook available. These have been very helpful when struggling with work.","We have access to an online textbook as well as other recommendations for studying for this course on the canvas page.","In our prelectures he gives us outside articles to read about that pretain to how physics came to be","Included a way to contact him along with links to on campus resources.","He encourages a specific process for problem solving and requires it for test corrections even. Encouraging a process for problem solving is good, especially as you get to these more advanced physics classes cause you can read the textbook but then you have to make jumps using things you just learned, often times not having much of a model to go off of, just knowledge about the situation and what physics may apply.","She provided helpful documents that summarized key concepts from [Removed] I, which served as a foundation for our current material. This occurred at the start of the semester when she posted these resources on [Removed], encouraging us to review them to ensure we were prepared. These documents helped reinforce essential knowledge, making it easier to build upon in our new lessons.","Dr. [Removed] would link youtube videos about related topics so that we could watch them outside of class. She would also let us know if any interesting seminars were going on outside of class.","Always provides study guides and encourages us to review slides and through discussion sessions.","There are course supplemental materials. These can be accessed outside of class.","For example, during the beginning of the semester she gave us review slides for mitosis. She did this in order to review knowledge from last semester biology.","She has listed extra material to review mitosis before. She also gives out worksheets and lists the textbook information that we could further read.","Dr. [Removed] is very accessible in both her office hours and one - on - one. In addition, she points her students to TA &amp; LA office hours.","She provides videos on youtube that can give us some more supplemental and basic level information for those who need that.","She has TAs walk around for help and also office hours that we can attend to get help. Also, she has step - by - step solutions on the lecture slides, which is helpful.","textbook","Dr. [Removed] uploads files of the textbook. Some of the files include math skills such as a review of integrals.","The first chapter of this course included dimensional analysis. This helped students gradually review math concepts ( such as algebra and conversions ), which helped prepare them for future physics modules.","During the first class after the exam, Dr. [Removed] reminded us of resourses available to use like the LA / TA review sessions and the [Removed] Learning Center.","In the first week of class, a majority of our homework problems and in - class problems were dedicated to reviewing previous knowledge we would need to have in order to succeed in the class.","Our first homework assignment was a calculus review with a very minor amount of physics. There were also several lecture questions in the beginning that focused on reviewing trig identities.","They always mention the resource's we have during exam week, and about going to [Removed], also [Removed] for me has study session, and also we have the discussion, and well the professors always has reasources for us.","In this course, my instructors made sure to upload all the information we would need to do all the activities in class. In the last class, we discussed course scheduling for next semester and were provided with links and an informative [Removed] to assist us in the process.","There is no pre requisite for this class","We didn't really have a set of pre - knowledge needed for this course","He has people who do research come in class and tell us how to apply and how it is beneficial.","We are given websites to go to when we need campus resources.","She would provide resources and where to find them.","there is no foundational or prereq knowledge for this course","We are given vector notes to review past physics topics we should have already learned. We are also given office hours were we can ask any type of question we need answered.","The professor offered a vector algebra review in preparation for the course, and [Removed]'s offered a review session for these topics","There's videos for reference after lecture notes are posted.","Our syllabus for the class clearly states the prerequisite knowledge. We sometimes go over important equations we must know from the prerequisite class, and our textbook also contains this information.","Professor [Removed] always provides cool demos and videos on his canvas page to help students get a deeper understanding or not just what we are learning but what we know. This helps reinforce our knowledge of the course and he also has very helpful TAs willing to help on whatever students are stuck or confused about.","The professor uploads recordings of the next class for students to review and assigns reading check assignments to monitor their preparation.","She has [Removed] slides and told us their are many prerequisitional opportunities on [Removed] to check our work and see what we are doing correctly.","We are provided access to the textbook so that we can learn everything from the foundation in this class.","The instructor has let us know that there are textbooks and videos available on the Internet that can help us if we have questions on the material. This has happened at two points : once at the beginning of the semester, and once before our first exam of the semester in September.","This has happened in class when taking notes / doing practice programs as a class. In different equations there have been symbols or short - hand many of us did not know. My instructor verbally explained to us what these symbols mean and why we are using them!","At the beginning of the semester we had the option to review basic important concepts.","Dr. [Removed] consistently reviews equations from mechanics when they're applicable to course content. This is very helpful for me because I took mechanics in [Removed] 3 years ago. \n Today in class we needed to use a force equation from mechanics that I had forgotten but luckily she quickly reviewed what the equation meant physically which helped me understand it.","We regularly have online learning modules that cover material and it has included modules on reviewing things from previous courses","Before the course began to pick up, the instructor covered foundational material about vectors and relevant mechanical topics in order to prepare students. She also released an optional assignment in the event that students wished to practice solving problems with this material.","In the beginning of the semester, Dr. [Removed] provided us with a review of vector properties and manipulation so that we could perform the vector calculations required for the course.","He has provided us with resources to help with our course registration and knowing which classes we need to take for our specific major to complete our requirements.","[Removed] is an understatement for how Dr. [Removed] implies for his students to go to things like [Removed], office hours, and study sessions. Along with that, he also loves to talk about other resources like [Removed] Learning Center and a plethora of other things that will help us to become better students.","A while back, our class was going to be on the library where they shared us information about future projects, resources inside the campus, etc.","In addition to just reviewing it himself and providing numerous examples in the course of the class, most topics have information posted about them already in the syllabus or otherwise available.","Earlier this week, our instructor discussed the different types of prerequisite courses, minors, and majors we can take as students. After discussing them all individually, she then provided us with the links to the websites that have more detailed information so that we can explore these options further."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

All of this material can help explore topics that go beyond the material taught in class.","My professor introduces more advanced concepts during lecture that may appear in more advanced courses of chemistry like chemistry 2, organic chemistry, [Removed], etc. I don't remember any specific examples from class but it happens pretty frequently like once a week or once a lecture.","Offers access to online [Removed] chem and beyond resources linked through canvas.","When we learned about the chrödinger equation, since it was advanced topic, she suggested that we go deep outside the class.","The instructor has linked resources within the course canvas page that redirect the student to other resources on the internet that could be useful in gaining a more in depth understanding of the topics. An example of this would be a link on one of the learning modules to an outside resource explaining dipoles in further depth.","She provides us with a lot of resources to dig into ourselves when we are studying on our own. Sometimes these resources go beyond the course material","In canvas, she has this “ Just for fun ” tab, and I THINK it contains extra material. She also provides question types so if we wanted to further our knowledge, we know what to look up.","Professor [Removed] has mentioned websites we could use or youtube videos we could watch to extend our knowledge on certain topics","Dr. [Removed] give us various resources to study for upcoming quizzes and exams.","Professor [Removed] provided video material that would explain topics we learned in even greater detail. She wanted to give us the opportunity to learn more about chemistry beyond the scope of her class.","We have prerequisite topic courses that help, this was given before the course.","My instructor provides an abundant amount of resources beyond the course material. My instructor has a page on canvas that has many extra resources such as videos, online textbooks, and practice problems.","My professor will usually let us know what topics are not needed to succeed in the course, but encourages us to learn more about them. One example is black body radiation which was not on the exam but she gave us readings to learn more if interested.","In [Removed] 301, Dr. [Removed] regularly encouraged us to explore advanced topics by providing a curated list of resources related to our current unit, including articles, videos, and online simulations. This usually happened after major lectures, where he would say, “ If you're interested in diving deeper, check out these resources ; they'll give you a broader perspective on today's material. ” These recommendations not only enriched our understanding but also inspired many of us to pursue independent projects beyond the standard curriculum. \n","We were learning about things in Unit 1, and my professor included extra information about something we were going over in the presentation. She also has a \" Just for [Removed] \" section on her [Removed] for things that aren't necessarily for the class but fun things to know.","She talks about how this could affect or how we learn some of these topics more in detail for pre - health or in upper class chemistry or biology.

When introducing our next unit exam, she recommended [Removed] videos to watch to go beyond just our lectures.","On our canvas page professor [Removed] provides links to different websites and texts where we can either learn more about the current topic we are learning or explore a different topic. She also provides information on different extracurriculars in chemistry.","Our instructor releases practice exam a few days before each exam date which includes questions that are more difficult than the ones we see during the exam. these practice exams have unlimited attempts and purposely includes question types harder than the ones we will see during the exam. I find this to be true and very helpful. studying more challenging material eases my mind and stresses during exam day and allows students to feel more confident. The questions on the practice exam are more complex and are worded in a harder more interpretive manner so that we are able to actually apply our skills andb knowledge.","Early in lecture she referenced some links to access to learn more or to get ahead on course material","There are always optional learning modules and gchem linked to specific course objectives. She makes sure we know where to go on [Removed] to find this extra help.","Dr. [Removed] always adds information to our lectures that goes beyond the material we are required to learn. She does this because she believes the information will provide a more well - rounded understanding of chemistry and because she finds these topics fascinating. An example of this was when she taught us about \" black body radiation \" even though it wasn't required for the class.","It mainly happens through the homework modules, there will be a little section reminding us that the content that they're covering in that little bit isn't apart of the question types/ won't be on the test. Dr. [Removed] has said sometimes in lecture about topics we can explore more into if we were interested / she just recommended it. There wasn't any pressure to learn material that wasn't specific to our course.","Dr. [Removed] has a' for fun' module which includes articles on interesting topics within chemistry. She also provides links to simulations that allow students to better understand the course material, if they want to.","The instructor provides several resources such as the resource list in canvas.","During her lectures she will go off and say how a certain topic can be explored more.

We also have a textbook that goes further into detail.","We have the option to utilize to the textbook to look at other readings, additionally the office hours and sanger learning center have been useful in looking and understanding topics beyond what's told in class.","He would suggest questions from the textbook that were a bit more advanced","I can't think of a specific example but he is always very supportive","He gives us extra videos on the canvas module to watch for better explanations if needed.","I honestly don't remember this happenjng","In some topics where we need to do research, the teacher recommend us some website to look through. And sometimes encourage us to look through some of them and read the ones that attract us more.","We talk about how we can move froward and this can be used to better prepare ourselves when doing course material.","During lectures, he encourages people that are interested in the field of chemistry to pursue advanced courses","If we need help with a certain subject, on multiple pushes has given us places we could go to for help.","The instructor showed up many different campus resources.","He sometimes goes into detail about his research as well as other real world examples and how it relates to the concept material. He extends the theoretical knowledge we gain and apply to actually advanced topics in the real world. He also mentions the realistic applicability of these concepts and how we can reason higher level problems.","Dr. [Removed] gives a lot of information on applications of our material on his projects in his observatories. It's very interesting. He gives a lot of extra information on advanced topics at the beginning of each lecture.","She often provides bonus lectures and materials that further explore the course material.","Recommends and provides links to supplemental lectures exploring topics further","She provided a link in the classes in regards to coding.","Professor [Removed] gives supplementary material relating to lectures. These often include other lectures or videos showing the physics concepts we look at in class.","we aren't necessarily given notes to study, so we often have to teach ourselves this anyway.","We have a textbook that has more information and she encourages us to read it.","The slides sometimes have problems that are more difficult than what we would be expected to solve on a homework / exam, and are left as an optional exercise to do outside of class. Also the professor sometimes leaves some formula derivations as an optional exercise whose solution can be found in the textbook.","The instructors have emailed us many resources that we have discussed in class. We are able to look further into them.","My instructor has provided learning and support resources on our canvas page. He has also shared them verbally during classes.","Sharing resources like the [Removed] learning center for us to utilize whenever we need assistance whether it be tutoring for a certain class.","The instructor directed us to several different pages of online resources where we could find many resources for additional help in mental health, school finances, school work, and tutoring sessions.","We had a librarian teach a class and show us how to navigate our school's vast research resources.","In many previous classes, my instructor constantly provides outside resources and information to us regarding both her course, and our other classes. I find it extremely helpful that she is so willing to help us out with other classes by providing tutoring places, [Removed], office hours, etc."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

asks us to solve problems during the lecture with our peers. This happens every class.","Dr. [Removed] usually posts an instapoll during class with a question from the material where she asks us to turn to our neighbor and speak about it. This happens typically once or twice a week and Dr. [Removed] typically says turn to your neighbor and discuss.","She sometimes gives discussion questions to talk to your neighboor about.","It doesn't happen in lecture ; however, we have a forum called [Removed] Discussion that allows us to ask questions and our peers or TA's can answer them.","We have these academic communities as well as office hours where people can ask questions and get them answered by either TAs or other students. It seems like it would be very beneficial to go and join one.","Caudill makes active learning during every lecture and allows for the students to discuss the material.","So every class we have interactive questions that we discuss with a person beside us so I think that really incorporated collaboration in this course. In the first few weeks these were more tailored to getting to know the person beside you, so they definitely helped.","Said that study groups were advisable.","She uses \" Active Learning \" to allow peers to learn the material together and collaborate.","Usually during her lectures, she gives us opportunities to answer questions and/or collaborate with the people around us.","The instructor gives us time to discuss with the people sitting around us the answer to a question she asks on the board in every class. She usually does this multiple times during class.","the instructor used instapolls for us to collaborate together with out peers. she did they very often and gave us a chance to work with the people next to us to apply what we were learning.","Each lecture, Dr. [Removed] has us answer active learning questions with the people next to us. We are then able to explain to each other how concepts work to solidify our understanding.","In every single class, Dr [Removed] offers opportunities to discuss what we have learned with the people next to us, encouraging peer learning.","During the lecture, the instructor will provide times to discuss the content with peers in order to help each other. This usually occurs 2 - 3 times per lecture for 3 - 4 minutes each","During every lecture the professor has included questions in the slideshow that instruct us to discuss the answer with the peer sitting next to us.","Instructor regularly puts practice problems or questions on the board and asks us to figure them out with someone next to us and collaborate on them. After, the professor asks if anyone would like to share and/or explains the answer and method.","Every lecture, the professor makes us talk with the people around us and discuss chemistry questions or personal life prompts.","We have the ed discussion posts in our classes and I find that very helpful that students can ask and answer questions to help each other out anytime. It's very convenient that we can also ask anonymously. Also every class, there is always some sort of practice problems and our professor usually asks us to talk with the people around us about the problem.","When having class lectures, she would have questions within the slides for \" Active Learning \". We then, as a class, would turn to the person nearest and discuss the question on the board.","Office hours are always encouraged and there is also a chat for everyone to ask questions to eachother.","Every lecture, the professor gives students a chance to explain to each other and make sense of the material that we're currently learning. [Removed], she says for us to make sense of it, then she explains it herself.","The professor always encourages open in - class discussions in which she directs us to speak to those sitting next to us to discuss a specific question or maybe even about their weekend.","During lectures she will take time to allow us to speak with the students around us to go over questions which is very helpful.","Dr. [Removed] implements discussion questions into her lectures, which encourage students to speak to one another about what we are learning. Just yesterday, we discussed multiple times how to attack math problems and the answers to thermodynamics questions. She simply asks use to \" turn to the people next to \" us and talk through the problems.","academic community","Instructor will tell us to talk to the person next to us and discuss the relevant material in a section called \" Active Learning \" nearly every class.","She encourages us to go to office hours and will tell us to form study groups.","Pretty much every lecture when she would give us practice problems, the lecturer would allow or encourage us to speak to others around us when working the problem.","Teacher made sure people were on topic and made sure that people understand the material.","The professor always stops her lectures and tells the class to engage with peers around us and discuss a concept on the board. This allows us to gain different perspectives of learning the material and thus learn from each other in a way.","Dr [Removed] always has us discuss problems with the people around us.","The instructor would have practice questions embedded in throughout the lecture which we would take a few minutes and work with people around us. This gave us a chance to collaborate with our peers and also review the topic we were just taught.","My instructor always includes opportunities for us to work out practice problems during the lecture. Similar to the [Removed], she will lecture us on the content before allowing us to demonstrate our understanding with our peers.","Throughout the whole course there has been opportunities, like office hours, where students are encouraged to work collaboratively.","In each class, she would always ask us to turn and discuss with others around us on the questions that are on the board. This was almost every single class.","Dr. [Removed] pauses after she goes over a topic and provides us with a practice question slide that we then discuss with the people around us. She does this a handful of times each lecture.","My professor always always us to talk about the material during the lecture with our peers and this is helpful at times especially when I am a little confused.","During lecture, Dr. [Removed] will give us time to problem - solve what's on the powerpoints with our peers next to us.","Students talk through practice problems with their peers.","Showed us where everything is useful.","Almost every class the professor has us talk things out with the people next to us.

She additionally recommends group studying.","Dr. [Removed] often has us turn and talk to each other to discuss a practice problem. This encourages us to get to know each other and get a better understanding of the material by discussing it.","There are a lot of turn and talks each lesson. She also sets up review sessions outside of class.","In almost every class, there is a problem in the lesson where the teacher asks us to talk with each other to answer the question. The teacher gives us a few minutes to collaborate with people next to us.","Let's us discuss questions on slides during class with peers.","They make it to where you can work with any person taking a [Removed] class regardless of professor.","The professor allows us to answer practice questions with those around us or simply just gives us a minute or two to talk about the material we just went over.","Since the start of the course she has made it clear that the other chemistry 301 courses are being taught the exact same way with the same materials and same exams. So, she highly recommended that we study with our peers in our class, other classes that she teaches, and with other students who have different professors. Before any exam, she posts the exam review, practice exam, and practice questions that can all be used for studying alone and with others outside of class.","Our instructor makes sure to create opportunities for us to work with peers and collaboratively learn the material through things such as the [Removed] [Removed] and example problems givne to use throughout the lectures. When given these our instructor encourages us to work with the people next to us and learn the material and how to solve the problems together.","She let's us work together to solve instapoll and practice problems during class and goes through it with us afterwards.","She gives us questions to answer, and encourages us to do it with peers.","Throughout the lecture, there will be multiple times when Dr. [Removed] will pause the lecture and tell us to talk it out with the people beside us. She gives us a few minutes to discuss topics and the questions she poses, allowing us to learn and work on material collaboratively.","Dr. [Removed] has study sessions and office hours available for more help on a certain topic. Students can work together and learn also.","My instructor gives us time to talk and explore something together before coming back as a whole. She does this every class.","After certain questions or prior to instapolls Dr. [Removed] would have us talk to the people around us to figure out what would be the correct answer.","Dr. [Removed] always host 1 - 2 minute discussions with our peers to break down an new topic and see if we can be able to come up with an idea of what the question is asking about. Also Dr. [Removed] opens a website called ed discussion, where students can post a question that are having difficulty answering, where TA's as well as students can give an detailed explained for the correct answer.","Sometimes during lecture, we are given moments to talk to people next to us over a topic in the class.","Often in class we turn and talk with those next to us. But there have been no set up group study hours or projects.","She lets us talk with the people next to us when doing the Active Learning slides","At least once every class period, she encourages us to talk to an individual next to us to work out a problem together. In our academic community 2 weeks ago, [Removed] [Removed] and [Removed] [Removed] help foster a community of learning on Tuesdays.","n / a","Oftentimes during lectures she tells us to discuss something with people next to us. I usually just sit there though haha","We have optional academic community sessions led by TAs several times a week. Here, students can work together to learn the material and receive support from TAs when needed.","The instructor allows us to discuss with peers about course content and think critically in groups. Every class she gives us questions to answer and encourages discussing with others.","The instructor encouraged us to attend recitations of the lecture material with other students, and creates discussions during class to collaboratively learn the material by answering questions in groups.","Since we have an exam coming up next week, our instructor has been reminding us to begin studying, encouraging us to work with each other to combat problems and better understand the material so we're prepared.","During lecture, when there was a tricky question or a new topic was introduced, the professor would give us time to talk to our peers and better understand in the problem. She mentioned to create a general theory on why this interaction happens and doesn't matter if you're right or wrong.","Dr. [Removed] encourages students to talk to each other about the course material during class. She does this every class.","Again with the active learning prompts embedded in the notes, Dr. [Removed] has us discuss these questions with people near us. She will give us a few minutes to discuss and bounce ideas off of our peers.","There are learning communities that are hosted by the TA's during the week. Professor [Removed] posted the times on canvas and mentioned these learning communities during syllabus week.","The instructor has allotted specific hours throughout the week for students to meet in a common space and work on class material. Additionally, the instructor often requests collaboration during the lectures as well. The instructor will designate time for the class to work together on practice problems and difficult concepts.","During the class, [Removed] would sometimes give us a little time to discuss problems or talk about some of the material with another student next to us ; however, I don't find this beneficial or effective in learning. Mainly due to how little time we get or due to how another person can be too shy to talk.","The instructor constantly will pause in the lesson and encourage people to talk amongst themselves to find the answer. This happens every lecture and the instructor will usually say break off into groups and then gather us back together.","We pair up and discuss practice questions, and she has also created collaborative times for us to work together","My instructor asks questions related to the content and has us work through the problems with the people sitting next to us. During the lecture time, I feel like there are plenty of opportunities to work with / learn from the people next to me. This usually happens at least once per class.","She just says to always talk questions out with peers.","She often has many questions on her lecture slides, and before telling us the answer she encourages us to make sense of the questions on our own and by talking to other people around us.

Then we go over the question with the professor.","She will give us time during every class to discuss with those next to us. This allows us to ask questions to each other and develop connections.","Dr. [Removed] has said we should turn and talk to each other to discuss problems this past week on Wednesday. We also have regular academic communities.","She lets us talk to our neighbor in class when she asks a question. This helps us learn the material better.","Each class the instructor will say \" talk to your neighbor. \" This usually is done after learning something new or to practice problems together.","Every day in class, we sit next to people and discuss questions the instructor gives us. She gives us around 3 min, sometimes even shorter, and when she explains it, she makes it more confusing.","While in lecture the instructor will tell us to turn and talk to our neighbor to work through a problem or topic.","Office hours are good places for group studying. Students are also allowed to turn and talk to each other.","In class, she will have us turn and talk to the people next to each other to explain what she has just discussed or to solve a question that she posed us. This occurs multiple times a class. We also have academic community sessions multiple times a week that are optional, in person opportunities for students to work with peers and their TAs for additional support.","In our [Removed] class, Prof. [Removed] often set up group activities where we'd work together to solve problems or discuss concepts, like balancing chemical equations or understanding reaction mechanisms. Early in the course, she said, “ I want you all to learn from each other, not just from me — chemistry can be easier to understand when you talk it through with a peer. ” These sessions made the material feel more manageable and gave us a chance to help each other out.","Every class we have slides that she has us discuss and talk through the concepts with our peers to understand them better.","The instructor frequently prompts us to converse with our peers about difficult problems or just various practice problems. She also encourages us to study with friends and attend office hours to learn the material in a group of people as to make it easier to understand / answer any questions we may have.","The instructor takes a few mins in lecture to allow students to work with their neighbors on practice problems multiple times in each lecture.","In every lecture, Dr. [Removed] always makes us talk with a neighbor and answer a question she proposed, which helps us collabortivley learn the material.THis helps a lot as if I'm ever confused, I can ask the TA for help which can both help me and my neighbor.","She'd tell us to talk about the material with the people sitting next to us periodically. Sometimes this was with [Removed] too.","Our Professor Dr. [Removed] has time set apart in class so that we are able to collaborate with our peers and share ideas about a common problem that she presents to the class.","Talk about a question on the board","The instructor incorporates practice problems within the lecture that we work on with our peers.","She gives us learning modules that are to be completed outside of class time, and also practice exams we can work together on to prepare for the actual exam. This happens in between every class and before every unit exam.","The instructor will give time during lectures to collaborate with your peers to work through practice problems","In every class, we work with our peers on the practice problems on the board. Dr. [Removed] usually specifies to answer this question with the people next to you, or she will say do it yourself and check with those around you. After this group work time, we go over the question as a class to ensure everyone is on the same page.","During class, Professor [Removed] would ask students questions regarding the materials and would always encourage us to talk to the people around us to solve the problem together.","During class, discuss lecture material and collaborate on practice problems. During academic community hours outside of class.","We have almost daily \" academic communities \" which are blocks of time outside of class where students are encouraged to come and work together on material. During these periods there are also undergraduate course assistants available to help students.","Every class she gives us a few minutes to discuss practice problems she puts on the board.","The professor would ask students to talk to their neighbors for a couple minutes to either get to know them or to think through chemistry concepts.","We have academic communities every night of the week to be able to work with others in our classes. We get to collaborate and there are TAs there to help if we need it as well.","Every day in class, Professor [Removed] would ask us to share ideas, solve questions together with the peers around us to facilitate a productive environment where everyone is helping each other.","She provides us with questions to solve with the people around us and hypothesize what the answer could be.","My instructor, [Removed], will have the students turn and talk to each other when there is a practice question in the presentation. The last time I remember this happening was last week.","The first couple of lectures, she had us share positive things about our weekend and about our learning journeys in high school. She used this collaboration to encourage us to attend [Removed] Communities, Recitations, and to study outside of school with the people we met and talked to. The material for all [Removed] classes are the same, so it is easy to study with people from different classes.","The professor prompts us to solve sample questions with our peers around us. She also recommends us to attend office hours, study groups, etc.","Often, when we are told to do a practice problem in the class, we are encouraged to talk to the peers around us to discuss how we thought through the process. She used words such as \" talk with your classmates / the people around you over this, \" and then proceeds to give us two to three minutes regarding the question.","Our first chemistry exam was last week, and Dr. [Removed] and the TA's encouraged the class to attend office hours. She also provided us with a schedule for it during our lecture, so we didn't have to search for the information in [Removed].","She allows us to stop and talk to our partner or someone next to us about some examples","Every lecture, students are given the opportunity to work together by talking to their peers to work on questions put up on the board through active learning. Through this, students are able to hear insights different to their own and learn in a way they did not think of before","Dr. [Removed] has set up academic communities to connect with other peers in the class and study together. She has also posted organization pages to join in community outside of the classroom!","Every class Dr. [Removed] tells us to recite or talk to the people we are sitting next to about whatever we are learning. \n","During the first week of the lecture, our instructor strongly encouraged us to study with peers, as teaching others the content solidifies your understanding and helps identify gaps in your knowledge. This approach to learning is also evident in the review notes our instructor provides, which contain tips to better understand the course material, many of them being collaborative work.","Dr. [Removed] often gives us time every class to discuss what she just talked about in the lecture with our peers. This provides us with an opportunity to learn the topic and see if we have any misunderstandings.","We are told to turn to our neighbors and discuss how we would solve the problems. This happens at least once every lecture.","As professor [Removed] is lecturing, she gives us a few minutes each class to discuss with partners about a certain question. This allows us to work together and learn the material better.","We have a lot of \" turn and talk \" moments in every class. Dr. [Removed] will put a problem on the board and students are encouraged to work out the problem with a peer or explain a concept to a peer to practice learning by teaching.","There are multiple sessions a week called \" academic community \" where there are TAs and other students present to work together to work through material.","We mostly just have small side chats about certain things that are being taught. For example, a question may be incorporated into slides and we turn to our partner to share what we think the answer might be.","Throughout most lectures, Dr. [Removed] gave us the opportunity to work on a practice problem with the peers around our seats if we pleased. \" Now work with someone next to you, see what y all come up with \"","She had us collaborate.","All of the study groups and office hours are ways to work with our peers and learn the material.","She will pause during lectures and have practice problems on the board, and have the students work together to come up with an answer. Then, she will go over the problem and the answer as well as how to get the answer.","This is a common occurrence during every lecture. Dr. [Removed] often pauses the lecture when the slides reach a question and asks us to discuss and work with our peers to answer the question, then helps us figure out the question if we don't understand it.","While Dr. [Removed] is going over the lecture slides, she will stop on a practice question and let us talk to our neighbor to try and solve the question. During this time, we are able to collaborate on the material and further learn by trying to explain to others around us.","So many opportunities. From office hours to academic communities and countless [Removed] practices.","She encourages us to talk eachother through the material that is being introduced. We are also encouraged to ask eachother questions and do our best to answer them correctly.","It happens every lecture. Dr. [Removed] will go over a topic or have a calculation on the board and she asks us to turn to our neighbor and explain it to each other.","We have academic communities where teaching assistants are in the room and students collaborate with each other to work on practice problems. The TA's are there when you have a question so it really promotes talking with other students and working things out between each other.","Often through the lectures she askes us to discuss with those around us about a topic or question. This gets you to collaborate with people you don't know, which can help you find people to study with.","Multiple times each lecture, she asks us to work a practice problem with the people around us. There are academic communities where you can help each other out on homework with guidance from TAs.","The professor has set times during the week called academic centers where students can come in and ask the TAs question about any material discussed in class. This is once or twice a week I believe.","We have academic hours as a collaborative opportunity which is a good option.","She often asks students to collaborate on questions in class. In my last class ( this Wednesday ), I was able to talk with the people around me, and we discussed questions constantly, helping explain things to each other.","There are office hours which we can go to and its very collaborative with not only the TAs but our peers as well. However, in class whenever we are talking she will shush us and gives us sometime to speak though.","In class, every day, we are told to talk to those around us about the presented problem. Our professor has also told us that it is beneficial to study with others as being one of the most effective study strategies for exam.","Each class she gives us the opportunity to work on practice problems with those around us.","In class we are encouraged to talk about the material among one another. This occurs every lecture.","There are academic communities everyday for classmates to work on homework and ask questions together.","Professor [Removed] encourages students to collaborate with peers and learn from each other during lectures","She will give practice problems during lecture and ask us to talk to each other about it.","Talking to others during class","The instructor would regularly give us practice questions during lectures and encouraged us to discuss our answers with the people sitting nearby. They'd say things like, “ Take a few minutes to work through this problem with your neighbor, ” which made learning feel more interactive and allowed us to hear different perspectives.","\" Turn and talk \" when there were problems to solve","Dr. [Removed] would pause the lecture a few times a class and give us a chance to talk to each other about what she is displaying on the slides","Every lecture will have a couple questions that students work through together.","We are prompted to discuss questions on the slideshow presentation virtually every class. The instructor asks us to discuss.","We are encouraged to turn and work on practice probelms or just explain certain concepts to each other in order to ensure that we know the material well and gain practice with them, without the help of the professor right off the bat.","In [Removed] 301, the instructor regularly set up small group activities where we worked on problem sets together during class. For example, during a unit on thermodynamics, the instructor assigned complex problems and encouraged us to collaborate to find solutions, saying, “ Work together to tackle each part — each of you brings a different perspective that will help solve this. ” Afterward, the instructor guided a discussion, asking groups to share their approaches, which reinforced learning and fostered a collaborative environment. This approach made understanding challenging topics much easier and more engaging.","She mentions how we have to talk to eachother and try to understand what is going on. She allows us to collaborate   with our peers on the questions.,","She had a lot of opportunities for office hours","we have time to discuss questions during class and outside of class. She gives us opportunities to talk to our peers during class.","This is done almost everyday via instapolls. Instapolls are an opportunity for multiple students to work together and attack a practice problem from their own perspectives and work together to get the correct answer.","The instructor will usually ask open ended questions during the lectures. After that, the instructor will allow us to talk to our \" [Removed] around us to discuss for answering this question.","She encouraged us to work through problems and concepts in our lecture slides with the person next to us before looking at the answer slide.","Office hours and learning with peers","We have various resources in our [Removed] homepage that allow us to connect with our TAs and other groups. There is a lot of recommended study hours and sessions they provide.","study groups","We were put into groups in lecture with our assigned seats placed next to each other within the first couple weeks of school. The instructor posted a seating chart and had us come up with team names. Now the team names are used to call on random groups of students to answer questions.","Our lab has groups where we collaborate on testing soil samples.","We were assigned to groups of four that work on a research project together throughout the semester. Our instructors asked us to visit the [Removed] Field Lab at the beginning of the semester to collect a soil sample from a spot that interested us as a group. As we analyze the samples, we are expected to work in pairs for all experiments ( switching every few weeks ), and share data in common as a table.","When when my instructor stated \" create opportunities for students to work with peers and collaboratively learn the material \" occurred during the first week of school when we reviewed the syllabus.","Our lab is mostly group work so it gives me and my classmates to talk and learn together, rather than by ourselves.","We are all divided into randomized groups at the beginning of the course. After we each went into our respective groups, the TA set aside 10 - 15 minutes for us to get to know one another as they will be our group for the remainder of the semester.","Every time we are in the lab we have to collaborate with our group mates to get the lab done and answer questions.","My instructor always tells us to work together and how we can use our time effectively with our lab partner. Additionally, she encourage us to work with our partners across the table and get involved with their research too.","Its a lab group research project. Working together is always inevitable.","The instructor made sure to switch the members in the groups around that way, everyone was working together. She also made us all go together to select the soil sample. She also encouraged us to get each other's phone numbers that way, we can all text and work together.","In lab, we work in groups and partners. The structure of the class makes it that we collaborate frequently.","Everything is group work","Yes, it is a group project, so we do work together to get to the common goal of displaying our semester long research project on a poster. We learn by experimenting and being in lab.","Well this is a lab after all! We are encouraged to work closely with our lab partner and our table as a whole. I know a lot of labs make you switch groups every 3 weeks or something but I do really appreciate the way our TA goes about it. Establishing a group is so important for this kind of research.","N / a","My instructor divides us into tables and gives us tasks to work in groups. This allows us to work with our peers and collaboratively learn the material.","During the lab, I work with three other students to study bacteria from a soil sample. It encourages teamwork and allows me to build connections with them.","group work \n","The instructor wants students to work with their tables to complete experiments. Students are expected to collaborate with table members to complete research poster as well.","We worked in group every lab so we were able to collaborate with each other.","She has us work in groups of two for each lab. During this time, students all collaboratively work on whatever lab work needs to be done.","In our biology lab course, the instructor regularly arranged activities where we worked in small groups to complete experiments and analyze results. For example, during our [Removed] and [Removed] electrophoresis labs, we collaborated on setting up reactions and troubleshooting unexpected bands in control lanes.","Since we have a group poster project, he has suggested us to meet to complete this task","We work together to complete the lab.","In this course, we frequently worked in groups during lab sessions to isolate and analyze bacteria from soil samples. This collaboration occurred from the start of the semester, as the instructor emphasized teamwork by saying, “ You'll learn more by working together and sharing your observations. ” We were encouraged to discuss results, troubleshoot issues, and share techniques, which helped us understand the material more deeply through peer interaction.","lab partners","Throughout lab, we have had various opportunities to work with our lab group. For example, when making serial dilution plates for our bacteria, we collaborated together as a group to get the task completed faster.","We always work together on each lab. None of the work is done by yourself when in the lab.","The instructor always encourages tables to share their findings with the whole group. Since many activities are only done in pairs, the instructor highlights the importance of sharing with others.","I really enjoyed when we went out to the wild to collect our own data. It builds connection between my group members.","My TA just always emphasizes working together as a group to get the best results. She usually will do class activities every week where we have to determine things by discussing it with our group first and then sharing with the class.","We work as a groups / table and as partners in lab. We recently collaborated on our annotated bibliography, and as a group we had to go off campus to learn about soil collection as well collect soil.","very good","That is what most of these labs are, a collaborative effort. While it may seem easy to drift apart and work individually, she would always remind us that this is not \" our side \" or \" my \" type of deal, but rather that all members efforts are equal and valuable.","Throughout the semester, students work with the same small group of 4 people. On the first day of lab, students received a lab notebook with a colored piece of tape corresponding to the table they would be seated at for the semester along with their fellow pod members. Before all the quizzes, the instructor encourages us to work as a team to prepare to take some of the workload off of individuals. Additionally, students have to work with their group members to complete each lab.","The entire course is structured around lab work that is conducted collaboratively to learn the material and procedures. Every single lab, we are working together to culture bacteria and go through the lab manuals as a group.","Every day we collaborate with our lab partners and work together to analyze our soil sample and discuss the implications of our findings. Every day of lab is collaboration.","Assining groups to go to the [Removed] or the wild flower center to collect soil samples created an oppurtunity for students to work together and learn the material.","We work together as groups and are able to discuss with the other side of the table about procedures / instructions / any input about the bacteria. We have a collaborative environment and are not restricted in terms of ways to learn.","we work in a lab group constantly","I think the entire purpose of the course if for us to work with peers and collaboratively learn the material since we work in the same group of 4 every time.","She will often remind us that we are meant to work as a group rather than sets of pairs. This encourages greater collaboration.","When we work through the labs, it is as a group or table, and we reiterate and enforce things learned from the prelab.","The whole class and lab is based on collaborating and working with your group to be successful.","She encourages us to work daily with our lab groups, as we are a cohesive table / team rather than individuals in class that happen to be at a table. She encourages us to share lab photos for our understanding, help eachother during procedures, and ask for help.","[Removed] ensures we share information and learn in our table groups. We recently did this when learning oil immersion with microscopes, we went by each persons in our table and observed prokaryote morphologies.","Because the lab is hands - on with partners, every lab allows us to collaboratively learn the material.","We work in pods so it's all collaborative.","Since this lab is all group work we collaborate in every lab. I ask questions, answer questions, and make conclusions with my lab partners in every class.","Our instructor encouraged us to get together with our lab groups to study for the quizzes together.","While the instructor was assigning a class poll ( instapoll ), we were encouraged to work on the question within our groups to try and solve it. This style allowed my teammates and I to learn more from each other and gain more perspectives on certain problems assigned.","In this case, there was a project due and there was one section for the comparison of graphs to see everyone's interpretation of how to create graphs to answer the research question given to all of us. This happened last week and the instructor told us before the class to come up with a project essentially finished to compare with our peers and maybe learn other ways to answer a research question.","Our professor encouraged us to meet to study for our upcoming midterm. My friends and I that I made in the class decided to study a few times this week to prep for our exam. Each day we are going to review one module for a total of 4 modules.","Dr. [Removed] puts students in cohorts of 5 - 6. She has us answer questions in our group and we are also in the same discussion section.","She puts us in groups so that we can get to know others. She also encourages collaboration as part of discussions and projects.","09/18 She gave us pieces of paper and pipe cleaners and let us demonstrate with our group meiosis I and meiosis [Removed]. Using these we also demonstrated nondisjunction and found out different probabilities.","We had the opportunity to work in teams to demonstrate the processes of mitosis and meiosis in class. It was very helpful in that we got to learn by touching the materials and working together.","She made small groups for the class to encourage collaboration with others in the classroom. Also, she frequently shares opportunities on campus related to science / genetics for us to explore and potentially get involved in.","Consistently within the course content the instructor provides opportunities for student collaboration in understanding course content. Whether this be with instapolls or with diagramed practices the instructor makes sure to make collaboration an emphasis in the course.","We are placed into pods in this class based on the table we sit at. Every day, we will participate in practice problems with this pod and discuss content. This allows us to collaborate and get to know each other.","The instructor encourages us to work together in groups to study and figure out homework problems. Our tables are also set up in groups for us to discuss in - class problems.","during instapolls, we discuss and work together to answer the questions","Ever since the beginning of the year, we were split into small groups that we were expected to stick with for a majority of the semester. We were encouraged to work with the people in our small groups and collaborate on [Removed] [Removed] that are given during class and during discussions that are also given during class.","She organizes the class into table groups, encouraging collaboration.","Our professor let us look over out projects together and we also sit in groups and discuss [Removed] questions during class.","My teacher organizes the class by pod tables and during lectures she gives us the opportunity to talk about the material and discuss our thoughts for the instapolls. \n","Every class our professor offers [Removed] [Removed] which are meant to be answered through group collaboration. On top of that, she pauses her teaching and asks us to check our understanding in pairs and go over any questions we might have. She also has us in table groups and encourages that we get to know each other and work together whenever we have confusions arise during her teaching.","During Dr. [Removed]'s office hours, she encourages students to work collaboratively and help one another in their homework. She also reinforces this idea in the class during group discussions and instapolls","We work in groups often for instapolls and other questions in class. We often work within our tables on smaller activities too.","We all have groups and working with peers help us learn a lot","We were assigned groups during the second week of classes so that we would familiarize ourselves more with our peers and so that we could find more opportunities to ask questions and engage in studying together. Also, we have discussions each week, which also helps us ask questions and talk to multiple people.","Dr. [Removed] does small groups where we get to collaborate with just a few students on solving a problem. This really helps everyone to learn, especially since the lecture hall is so big and has so many students otherwise. The whole atmosphere becomes much more intimate and tight - knit, and I personally feel much more comfortable asking / answering questions because so many people get to speak when their group is called on.","Dr. [Removed] does a really good job helping the classroom feel like a collaborative environment. She encourages discussion and it is great for helping foster a welcoming space that is comfortable for all students.","She creates ice breakers for us and allows us to talk to each other in the beginning of class. She also put us in groups so that we would be forced to collaborate with each other on the daily quizzes.","She made groups for us to sit in with our peers every day, and we did ice breakers to get to know each other. We also do instapolls in class and she allows us to communicate with our peers about the answers before walking us through them.","We sit in groups based on our discussion section so we can make connections with our peers","The professor grouped us in groups from our discussion section and has us sit with them each lecture. We answer solve questions and answer them as a team.","Dr. [Removed] split us up into small groups, which facilitates discussion in general. Besides that, she also has held in - class activities, like when we were speaking about nondisjunction in meiosis, where she had us model meiosis with pipe cleaners. It really helped because she created an environment where she expects us to discuss and collaborate with each other.","For [Removed] questions, we are told to collaborate with our group and talk about the right answer","This class has a discussion section once every week. During this section, we can work with our classmates and learn together.","We have a seating chart in lectures where we sit with our groupmates. During class, we get to collaborate with the other members of our group and even answer questions as a group when our group name is called on.","During class, we are regularly asked to answer instapoll problems about the material just learned, and during that time a lot of people talk to each other to figure out the right answer. For each question, the instructor go over how to answer them, so the whole class review the problem one more time. We are also seated in the same area with the teammates, which helped me a lot to be more open to ask questions to the peers.","During class, students are broken into groups to discuss and answer questions the professor gives us in lecture. Discussion sections also allow students to work with the people around them to answer questions.","The instructor splits the whole class into groups. We sit in these groups during class, and she changes the groups throughout the year. She calls on groups to answer her questions. Additionally, we have a couple labs throughout the year which require us to work with our teammates and compare projects.","Dr. [Removed] always encourages us to collaborate on quizzes, and there is one every week. This helps because it helped me meet really interesting people and it also helped me do well on the quizzes, and clarify certain concepts. She tells us to collaborate on the quizzes at least once a week, and she says to make sure not to just copy what other people are putting on their quizzes- to understand what is going on.","Every class we work with our team members to answer the questions she has in class. This helps us learn together and ask someone besides the teacher if we're confused on a topic.","Instapolls during class and working together during discussion sections.","During every instapoll, Dr. [Removed] asks us to turn to our neighbor and discuss the different ways to solve the problem. He always makes sure to tell us about how important it is to collaborate with classmates.","The instructor will propose new material and problems and give us time to work with our peers before explaining how to solve. Then after solving they will give us time to further work through any issues.","Asks us to talk with our neighbors during practice problems.","He created allowed us to solve problems collaboratively","During lecture, Dr. [Removed] gives us many opportunities to turn and talk to our neighbors when discussing a concept, working on a practice problem or doing an instapoll. He encourages students to collaborate and form a study group so each person can share different thoughts and ideas.","Every class period Dr. [Removed] has us talk to our neighbors when attempting the practice problems on our own. We also introduced ourselves to our neighbors at the beginning of the semester and exchanged our numbers in case we needed help with the material.","For physics, we perform a lot of problems that involve calculating. Therefore, we turn a lot to the side to talk to the person next to us to see if we agree on answers. This happens every class and is encouraged by the professor.","My professor will present practice problems. They take awhile, so he has us turn towards our friends to solve them together.","He constantly encourages us to talk to our neighbors and collaborate with them.","Every week in class we have our [Removed] quizzes where we are able to work with our peers. With that said, this helps us interpret our learning, and see where we might be struggling.","Again, offers office / drop - in hours. TAs have them as well and [Removed] sessions available.","Every lecture the instructor encourages us to talk to our neighbors and work with them on the problems we are doing. He encourages us to talk to new people.","During our daily instapolls, after the professor has lectured on most of the content, we get to work with the people around us to find the solution to the problem.","The instructor usually will propose questions and ask us to collaborate with our neighbors before giving the answers.","During the lecture, we solved instapoll problems with our classmates as understanding checks on the lecture. They are very low - stress ; we come together as a class to solve the problem and check our answers.","Every class Dr. [Removed] has us take time to discuss questions and concepts with out peers.","The instructor would walk us through an instapoll or example, pause in the middle and let us try to figure it out with the help of our classmates and TAs ; then he'll explain it to us if we didn't understand.   He does this every class.","In nearly every lecture, the professor will ask students sitting in lecture to talk to the people sitting next to them about the problem. In his office hours, you don't actually get to have much time to talk to the professor ( about 3 minutes max for a problem depending on how detailed it is ), so you'll spend the majority of office hours trying to figure out a problem with other classmates who also are stuck on the problem. Sometimes this is productive, but in my experience it usually hasn't been","He always sets aside time for us to discuss problems with those sitting next to us.","For every class, the professor has a time reserved for problem solving with the people around us. This is very helpful because it allows students to take amongst ourselves and ask questions. If the professor notices that we are not collaborating, he encourages us to.","with every question and instapoll we are highly encouraged to discuss with those around us.","Forcefully took long pauses to make students collaborate with each other on exams.","He continuously asks us to work together and encourages us to talk to a neighbor even if we don't really want to. We work together for instapoll questions.","This happened this week on Monday and we were able to work on an instapoll question where we discussed the methods. The instructor was encouraging peer collaboration and was asking questions about how to solve the question.","When questions are presented, he encourages us to talk to our neighbors to help find the answers. This helps a lot.","Like I said earlier, whenever the professor explains a problem or whenever we do practice problems, we are encouraged by the professor to talk to our neighbor and see if they understand. \n He encourages us like this each class.","[Removed] always asks students to \" turn to their neighbors \" in order to solve for the answer","Dr. [Removed] always emphasizes for us to converse with our neighbors and talk about the problems / concepts we are actively learning in class. During this time we can share ideas or answer questions that each other may have.","Every class he encourages us to work alongside our neighbors to solve the instapoll questions. He also made a collaborative midterm 2 retake test where we could work together with our peers.","In every class, Dr. [Removed] encourages us to problem - solve with those around us. This can be seen in practice problems via [Removed] as well as in our Midterm 2 Make - up, where we were allowed to collaborate for.","When doing squarecap sessions, the professor lets us talk and work with peers. He said to work together if we wanted to and needed help.","Professor [Removed] recommends studying with peers and in a group to collectively learn material together and teach one another concepts some may not understand","Before the end of each class, Dr. [Removed] opens up 10 [Removed] questions. While the questions are open, he encourages us to work through the problems with our classmates.","This course has a required discussion section once a week with about 20 of the students from the lecture. During this time, we go over a worksheet that includes material from the lesson and we have the ability to ask questions on a more personal level due to the size. We are able to collaborate and talk about the class, whether it is over the material or upcoming exams.","The instructor would create squarecap mini assignments after lectures which allowed for collaboration, fostering interactions with other peers.","In every class, we do an online \" quiz \" which we can talk to each other for. He also walks around the room along with the TAs who help out anyone with a question.","During our squarecap learning sessions, students are able to help each other and learn the material together. Furthermore, many students also take notes together during the class lecture in order to learn the material.","Now and then he would send out research opportunities for students and would post the information in the announcements. He would also bring it up in class to make sure everyone was aware of the opportunity.","During squarecap questions he asks us to use outside resources such as TAs or people who sit next to you. He leaves students to do the best of their abilities with problems that will most likely be on the next exam.","During squarecap sessions we interact with other people.","At the end of every lecture we participate in square caps which allows us to work with the peers around us to complete an assignment about the lecture we just completed. During this time we also are able to ask the TAs and [Removed] for help to better understand the concepts and at the end of class the instructors reviews the questions and answers.","Every class day he has us do a square cap session where after the lecture where he lets us talk to people around us about the questions. This happens pretty much everyday in class. He always tells us we are allowed to talk to others and work through the problems together with a group.","At the end of every lecture, we do these squarecap quizzes about the material covered in the lecture. At this time, students work with each other to answer the questions.","One day a week, Dr. [Removed] requires us to go to a discussion section and do a worksheet. This encourages participation as we collaborate with peers and our assigned TA.","The discussion sections have us split into groups. We are split into groups by the TAs sometimes further than that.","We always work together on the square caps during class. Dr. [Removed] encourages this collaboration.","It wasn't [Removed] that was providing access but actually the TA in my biology discussion. In the discussion we collaborated and worked together.","When i think about the words \" Create opportunities for students to work with peers and collaboratively learn the material \", the only two instance to which I assumed it related to were the discussion groups alongside his suggestions to study with others. In terms of suggesting studying together, this happened toward the beginning of the year when he was introducing the class while the discussion groups are apart of the class curriculum which happens once a week.","As said in the previous question, Dr. [Removed] allows us to work collaboratively to complete the [Removed] are the end of each class.

This happens at the end of every lecture day.","Since we have discussion sections I think of that as a time to work with my peers. He refers to the discussion section and our TA's as resources.","Discussion groups","In this course, there are discussion section days where the big class is separated into smaller groups of students. This happens once a week, and it allows for students to get to know each other as well as collaborate on a \" discussion section worksheet \" that helps to understand and apply the material that we learned during the lectures.","We have squarecap questions at the end of each class where we go through these questions discussing with our peers around us the different concepts and can ask each other for help or help others","She makes different R pages for us to follow along with in class. It is very helpful because we can interact with the exact code and data she is teaching us about in class. She gives us time to talk to people close to us during this process.","Dr. [Removed] has us work together on coding sections in class, and we have a lab group that we complete labs together with.","Has weekly labs with randomized student groups. Also frequently provides in - class collaborative activities and group projects.","Labs are in groups, projects that can also be in groups, and opportunities to take in class work outside of class.","Help us learn by interacting in class.","As we cover material, we are given time to try out the things that we learn for ourselves. The instructor encourgaes the students to work together to try out the problems given in class and to help each other.","In Dr. [Removed]'s stats class, she often allows us to group up and problem - solving meetings during class exercises, to help students learn together.

We are supposed to work together to solve the problems and ensure that we fully understand them. This occurs every class.","\n In the course, the instructor frequently incorporated group activities during class, such as problem - solving exercises or peer discussions about key concepts. For example, during one lecture, they asked students to pair up and work through a challenging example problem, stating, \" Collaborate with your neighbor to see how you would approach this problem, and then we'll discuss it as a class. \" These sessions typically occurred midway through lectures and allowed students to learn from each other's perspectives while reinforcing their understanding of the material.","I learn very well interacting with my peers and collaborative examples.

They offer help at all times and there is never a lack of them","Especially in the first couple of weeks, the professor would allow students to talk to one another. Now, we collaborate during class when she allows us to discuss the content.","Motivated us to get into study group. Saying to find your study friends that really helps.","Our professor always encourages us to discuss things among out peers while in the class and share our ideas. She also encourages us to form study groups outside of the class.","My professor likes to periodically give us \" active learning \" opportunities through our lecture. These involve interacting with the students around me to work on a problem on the screen. It also gives me a couple minutes to talk to them as friends and peers, and to learn something about them!","Every class, there are multiple oppertunities to talk to the people around you. This facilitates a welcoming environment to allow you to get to know other peers and actually talk.","The teacher has active learning moments put into the lectures where you talk to those around you, sometimes just about stuff completely unrelated to the course to break the ice. Sometimes it would be to discuss a certain topic between y' all before the reveals the answers and explains them. \n","This happened during the beginning of the first week, where Dr [Removed] asked us to speak to the person next to us about any hobbies we have outside of the class and if we did anything over the summer. Dr. [Removed] said this was a opportunity to make friends and get to know the people around us.","At the start of the year we did a small activity where we turned to our neighbors and introduced ourselves, and talked about some of our hobbies.","We are told to discuss questions with the people around us. This can lead to getting to know people outside of class.","She didn't do this much but occasionally she will encourage us to talk to our neighbor about something random.

Additionally, with talking to others around us, it helps each other on any ideas that we might be confused about and would be better explained by someone else.","As we were getting closer to our exam date our instructor advised us to work with others while studying. She said it's helpful to teach someone the material you are learning as well as listen to other people's ideas and ways they remember material.","Before the start of each class time, the instructor will leave time for students to talk among themselves and have a chance to get to know each other. The instructor will also set aside specific time in class that leaves time to talk with those seated around me.","It happens every class, she always tells us to discuss a lesson, or as simply as share how our weekends were.","When the professor created the canvas page for this course she included a fun section. In this fun section there is clubs and orgs where chemistry students can join and get to know one another.","She encourages us to go to office hours together","The instructor created learning community, which is active before the exams, and it helps students to learn with other students as well as build connections","Before we would dive right into the material she would ask us a question like what we did this weekend and ask us to talk about it to the person next to us.","This happens quite frequently. The instructor always encourages us to go to academic community, which allows us to get to know our peers as individuals outside of class time.","Our instructor has encouraged us to talk with our peers about our lives outside the classroom. She has also encouraged us to use the resources outside the classroom, such as the [Removed]'s learning center.","She lets the students discuss topics with their neighbors.","She encourages us to study with groups and explain the material we learned to other people so we understand it ourselves.","My professor told the class to engage with my peers and I formed study groups. Through these study groups I learned that my peers have lives outside of the classroom and I have been able to expand my social circle vastly.","Asking people about their weekends is sometimes incorporated into the lesson.","[Removed] of how to respond this.","She often encourages study groups and going to discussion sessions with people within the class.","Sometimes she will tell us to turn to each other and talk about what we did over the weekend etc. It hasn't happened often, but she has done it a couple of times.","Daily in the class she gives chances to talk to peers about the topic and problem solve together, thighs helped in understanding the topic and succeeding.","a couple times at the beginning of class she would have us talk to the person next to us for a few minutes. It would be random topics like what we were looking forward to during the weekend or what our favorite sport is.","The instructor suggests that people in the class form study groups and help each other out when studying. This was said in class and students are open to collaborating.","She gave us time to talk over specific questions and did some ice breakers on the first day of class so we could meet new people.","Before class starts, Dr. [Removed] sometimes will give us a prompt to discuss with the person next to us about our lives. For example, one time she asked us to talk about what we did over the weekend.","At the beginning of some classes, my instructor has given the class a small question about ourselves unrelated to the class to answer with the people around us.","She encourages students to attend office hours and form study groups outside of class. She also gives time during class to work questions out with peers which is another way to get to know them.","The instructor asked us to introduce us to the people nearby and talk about things we liked outside the classroom. This happened on the first day of class and we sometimes also discuss what we did on the weekends on a Monday.","Didn't really happen.","The professor asked us to share information about ourselves on multiple occasions within class. She prompted us to share one thing we thought we could do really well and I got to learn about my peers.","During the first couple of classes, at the beginning of class, or during collaboration times, [Removed] would encourage us to talk to our peers about more than just the course content. She would do this by providing prompts. Ones usually pertaining to a question about our lives in general.","In every active learning session, I talk to the person sitting next to me. After discussing the material, we have casual conversations, which helps build a connection beyond the classroom.","She encouraged us to form study groups with the people around us. She also encourages discussion when answering Instapolls.","At the beginning of the school year, Professor [Removed] gave us examples of how we could form study groups to get to know each other better.   She also sometimes, at the beginning of lecture, gives us opportunities to talk to the person next to us and ask about their weekend.","During every lecture, Dr. [Removed] gives us time to talk and work together on practice problems. She often begins these sessions by starting with “ talk to your neighbor about … ”.","The professor has often made everyone speak to the person next to us multiple times each lecture, and encourages those who aren't speaking to speak. Some of the questions we discuss aren't course related but personal, so that we can actually get to know each other.","As we take notes, she shows example questions on the board. She'll tell us to introduce ourselves to our seat neighbors first, and then work on the problem together.","We have these sessions called [Removed] Communities that allow us to meet other chem students and allow us to work out the problems and talk out the material to ensure we understand what she has been teaching us.","She tells us to make study groups and talk amongst people we sit next to.","She promotes study groups and has spoken on the importance of the \" coaching effect. \" She described it as the effect in which a person, by encouraging someone else to do something in a positive manner, reinforces the behavior they encouraged in their own life. Using this principle, she promoted us studying and promoting positive study/ life behaviors with our peers.","She had us talk to the people next to us about personal questions at the beginning of the semester.","Our class has an academic community that allows for students to meet eachother and work on chemistry practice problems with the help of TA's if needed. I have attended once and was able to meet people in my major ( geoscience ) which was nice since its a small group of us.","We have academic communities which help us engage with each others and TAs.

She always states how to study with any [Removed] 301 professor and the students. She talks about office hours between her and the TAs.","Dr. [Removed] will encourage study groups or going to office hours where we can learn more about certain concepts. These experiences come with building positive relationships with others that are going through the same struggles or accomplishments. \n","We have office hours with our tas called academic communities and i ve met a few of my friends through going every week where we study and find ways and techniques to remember the unit material.","Dr. [Removed] told everyone to turn to the person sitting next to us at the beginning of class and share something we are good at.

She provides us with space where we can talk to our peers and help one another in these community learning groups.","There are discussion boards for all classes. She encourages to study with others.","During active learning modules [Removed], she allows us to talk to one other, mostly on the subject but we do talk about other things when we answered the question.","At the beginning of class we had icebreakers to introduce ourselves to eachother.","This one time, at the beginning of the semester, Dr. [Removed] gave us an activity that allowed us to interact with people around us and to learn more about ourselves outside of the classroom. I feel as though this activity allowed me to grow closer to those around me and to see them as friends and not only classmates.","The instructor created opportunities for students to get to know their peers as people with lives. outside of the classroom, as in the beginning of each lecture allowing students to talk about how their week has been to neighboring peers around the student.","On the first day of lab, we were instructed to have about 5 minutes of getting to know our lab group-- so general question such as name, major, hometown, and more. This allowed my group to be more comfortable together as it was our set lab group for the semester.","When we had to collect soil for our lab, our instructor encouraged us to all go as a group with out table. The instructor encouraged us to carpool and take this opportunity to get to know one another.","When we first were assigned groups, we were given time to exchange information and get to know each other.","We are placed in random groups, which allows us to meet other people. We also have assignments that are done out of lab, like collecting our soil samples. This allows us to have conversations outside of lab and get to know each other.","The instructor encouraged us to share our interests and backgrounds by asking questions like, \" What hobbies do you have outside of class? \" This approach created a friendly atmosphere and helped us build relationships, making the classroom feel more inclusive and supportive.","We got to meet outside of class to collect soil from the [Removed] Center. I walked to my group mate's apartment so that we could all get a ride to the site. It was a nice bonding experience and I got to learn more about what everyone was like outside of lab.","It happened in our introductory class, towards the middle of the lecture. She let us turn and talk to our group and share our names and our majors. We got to have good conversation.","At the beginning of the semester we were told we were going to need to go out of the school to collect our soil sample. Since it was the start of the semester we felt uneasy as our group wasn't the closest and wouldn't talk throughout the class. After we decided to go to the further soil collection site and had to sit in a car with each other, we ended up learning so much about each other that we would ve never known if this opportunity was never created.","Since this course is meant to do in groups. There are lots of group interaction. We also went to LBJ wild flower center to collect soil.","In the course, we needed soil samples for our research. Hence, we went out as a group to the [Removed] [Removed] center to get our group's sample together. This was the second or third week of classes.","On the first day of class we got the chance to introduce ourselves to our lab partners. We also made group chats with them to communicate outside if lab","We were required to go to a soil collection site together, so that fostered time to be able to get to know one another.","With the way this class is structured, you're likely going to be interacting with your group everyday and possibly with other lab groups. Additionally, in the beginning of the semester we were asked to collect a soil sample at [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] wildflower center outside of class hours. This was a good experience to meet my classmates not in a stuffy classroom setting and talk about less school affiliated subjects. This small experience was great and I wish more classes did this.","The instructor let us talk to our lab mates the entire time and collaborate. They also encouraged us to make a group chat so we could communicate outside of class.","Our instructor, Dr. [Removed], came in once during the semester to tell us how her daughter had made many friends during lab so that we should feel eager to make friends with the people we'd be spending the next few months with. So we did!","Frequently ask how day is going and what plans for weekend. Set up office hours to talk outside privately.","I don't remember","Obtaining a soil sample and creating a poster presentation are both opportunities outside of the classroom to work with groups. This has allowed groups to form closer bonds as we are expected to spend time together outside of class.","Allows for good work in a group","We were assigned random groups the beginning of the semester so we learn how to work with different people like in the real world.","We were required to drive with our group at the beginning of the semester to get our soil samples","We work in lab groups and this allows us time to get to know one another.","Our instructor put us in randomized groups and we were able to introduce ourselves to each other. This allowed us to be able to get to know others in our class and discuss our outside lives with each other.","[Removed] lets us talk about our personal lives and chat when we are working on experiments, so it helps us know our lab partners better. Also, during the soil collection procedure we drove to a site to collect soil","The instructor has encouraged us to make group chats and take time outside of seeing each other in lab to work together and collaborate on things. This opens the door for knowing people as more than a lab partner.","we had to obtain a soil sample off campus to start our research for the semester and in doing so most groups and mine had to carpool to the location because some people didn't have a car, creating an opportune for me and other people to rly get to know our peers.","I was thinking of the day our lab group went to collect the soil for our research. It happened more near the beginning of the semester, and I do think we all just got to know each other better.","Everytime we come into the lab, we work with those at our table and are able to not only work with them in the lab, but spend time working on group assignments outside of the lab that allow us to spend time with each other and really connect over the content. With more time together, it's hard not to get to know someone, and we are always free to talk with each other during the lab time ( as long as we are getting our work done ).","When we had to go pick up soil, we had to create a group chat to organize rides and schedules. This has led to us getting to know each other in a different environment and also talking about our lives outside of the lab classroom.","we were able to go collect soil together off camps for our research project which allowed us to build relationships","Having the chance to go to the field lab and collect a soil sample together as a group really allowed us to get to know each other, and I would go as far as to say that we're all pretty good friends now.","We have assignments / projects together in which we get to know each other more","In the bio lab course, the instructor emphasized teamwork by ensuring we completed all lab activities together in groups, never individually. They also frequently switched up our seating arrangements within our groups so that we got to know everyone and didn't rely on one partner. This structure helped us build connections with our peers and encouraged collaboration throughout the course.","We had to go out to the [Removed] to sample soil. This happened about 3 - 4 weeks ago on Sunday, together, we drove out and collected soil. The instructor encouraged us to go as a group.","During our first lab, the instructor gave us time to introduce ourselves and talk to our group about our lives. That was the only time she explicitly did this but my group talks about our lives in every lab.","The participation with lab experiments fosters conversation with others that allows for people to connect more and understand their lives outside of the class.","My instructor has always encouraged discussion in our lab groups! Since my lab group is super friendly, we have always had conversations about our lives outside the lab, and the four of us also planned to meet outside lab because we became such good friends as well!","This happened towards the beginning of the semester as we were advised to get our peers contact information to stay in contact throughout the semester.","We sit in groups and can collaborate on homeworks and quizzes.","Dr. [Removed] is super nice when it comes to collaboration. I love how she encourages it, and it has made the studying experience so much more fun and rewarding than other classes where it is discouraged. I've made many friends through this, both inside and outside of class.","The teacher puts us in assigned groups with the same people we have discussion session with. As a result you develop friendships with the people you sit with every day in class and in discussion session.","Formed small groups in discussion groups for students to get to know each other and form relationships.","At the beginning of many classes, Dr. [Removed] will allot a few minutes to us discussing an ice breaker with our group. One time, we had to explain what animal we would be. Also, each of our tables came up with team names, which is funny.","When our professor begins class, sometimes she begins the lesson with an ice breaker, such as at the beginning of the week. She encourages us to discuss our weekends with our peers and share our experiences regarding certain topics.","During class, we have occasional icebreakers, where table members are able to get to know one another! Additionally, as quizzes are collaborative, classmates are able to meet up outside of class hours to work on quizzes so that students may learn and appreciate one another more","At the beginning of class, before she beings lecturing over the material, Dr. [Removed] will put up an icebreaker to evoke conversation between tablemates. These icebreakers are usually fun such as \" Of you were an animal, what animal would you be? \" and she'll ask the class what some of the things we said included. She also assigns us seats ( shuffled halfway through the year ) based on our discussion groups so we can get to know the people in our class better.","Every week Dr. [Removed] will put a discussion question onto the board. The discussion question is usually about people's personal lives, for example last week ( 10/28 to 11/1 ) she told everyone at each table to go around and talk about the latest movie they had seen.

We can work through problems together and we kind of know each other too since we see each other a lot so it's easier to ask questions.","The instructors allow us to do icebreakers and make us work in pods during class. I feel like this forces us to build relationships with each other, and encourages us to meet up to study.","Within the first week of school, we got into teams that allowed us to collaborate with classmates to determine answers to questions and instapolls asked during class.","Make us talk about questions she asks in class - forcing us to talk about our lives","She groups us in groups from our discussion sections.

This happens almost every lecture. She explains that being able to teach others helps you remember.","In my [Removed] chemistry course, the instructor often displayed chemistry questions on [Removed] slides and asked us to partner up with the person next to us to discuss the problem together. The instructor said, \" Talk through the problem with your partner — explaining concepts to each other will help solidify your understanding. \" This practice encouraged peer learning and collaboration, making the expectations for supporting each other in class clear.","She often lets us know that we are learning the same material that the other classes are learning and that we should reach out to them","She always tells us to listen when she is talking and we always do collarboative work in class.","She just says to talk to the person next to you and that's about it during class to answer some questions.","During the course, Dr. [Removed] always says, make sure you create study groups and try to teach and learn from your classmates to encourage us to better understand our content. She usually does this more often right before we have a test and encourages collaboration.","in the beginning of the semester, the professor encouraged forming study groups to learn from each other. The professor also said to utilize all the resources on canvas.","In each class, there are active learning questions where you discuss the answers and explanations with the people sitting around you. This act of explaining to others helps you support and learn from your classmates.","The week before our first exam, our instructor encouraged us to study with other students. She emphasized the fact that explaining the material to others is the best way to test our understanding of the material.","Dr. [Removed] often allows us to discuss with our peers, usually at least once every lecture. She expects that we discuss problems on the board in order to help our understanding as well as our peer's.","We were learning about [Removed] structures and then she told us to talk to our peers to figure out what the structure would look like. Then she told us to try to explain to each other what the structure would look like.","During class we often have discussions with our classmates where we our required to engage on different questions and help each other. Outside of class we have academic communities hosted by our TA's where students can come together and work on topics they may be struggling with or to gain extra practice.","The instructor ewncourages learning communities in order to learn the topics together \n","[Removed] said to look for people to make friends with and create study groups. She also recommends using the test questions to understand what topics are going to be on the quiz or test so that study groups can practice them.","We have a few small discussions of questions which is posting on the board in during very class. This provides us to get a chance to hear other people's understanding and logic of questions","Encourage conversation with others when doing practice problems","Each class, Dr. [Removed] always incorporates active learning slides in her [Removed]. During these, she encourages us to work in small groups with people around us to make sure everyone understands the material.","Dr. [Removed] will stop speaking and let the students talk with each other to try and either answer a question or just discuss a topic. This will happen multiple times every lecture.","When we were during [Removed] structures she said to practice with peers. she mentioned it helps to have friend to keep going forward.","The instructor briefly discusses that we should form study groups to better learn the material and prepare for tests.","Maybe when she is talking is class and often tells us to talk with the person next to us or a friend. This is engaging and helped me make friends","During class, the instructor always sets aside time for us students to talk about what she taught. We collaborate, teach each other, ask questions, and learn.","Before exam - instructor outlined how we can support each other studying as a group, people who don't know the content can learn from those that do and those that are knowledgeable can study effectively through explaining the content","In every class she encourages going to office hours, discussion sessions and more. She strongly suggests we study in groups and make friends with other students.","The instructor encourages us to answer questions during the lecture with the people around us and talk through concepts throughout class.","\" talk to someone next to you. \"","During many times in the semester, the instructor asks everyone to talk to their peer. Discussing about the topic and what it is about.","every class day, Dr. [Removed] have us, her students, turn and talk to our peers about the concepts we are learning, in order to get different perspectives from each other, and to learn from those around us.","She has us all talk to each other to work out problems and also do some post weekend ice breakers. \n","The teacher asks us to talk to each other to learn from each other. This is significant if one student does not know enough information and the other student knows the information. This usually happens every class.","i don't remember","Dr. [Removed] mentioned that every person taking chemistry 301 are learning the same topics at the same time. Meaning we should collaborate with people in the other chemistry 301 classes too.","The professor uses \" active learning \" during their lectures that force students to discus the topic with each other","Students should support and learn for each other because it can help with no not a certain topic and encouraging learning","She gives us lots of information for us to use and lots of materials, in which she tell us how many of us can learn from each other whether we are right or wrong","With the problems from before, we were asked to work them out and discuss with people around us.","She really encourages us to use the multiple resources to study with our classmates, whether that is using the office hours and discussion opportunities or using threads to communicate with people in class. She mentions these resources each class.","The kind of office hours I mentioned before, academic community, is the best opportunity for people to get together and learn from each other. It is more hands off, with students solving problems and TAs around if they can not figure it out together. Dr. [Removed] advertises it almost every week.","She always says this during class.","Professor [Removed] encouraged us to make study groups or attend academic community meetings to learn.","Dr. [Removed] would often provide slides with prompts or discussion questions to guide our conversations. These slides encouraged us to engage with the material on a deeper level and to share our thoughts with our peers. This peer - to - peer interaction was invaluable, as it helped me to solidify my understanding of the concepts and to develop my critical thinking skills.","The instructor frequently goes over how we should be studying together in increments before the test in order to have the best chance of succeeding on the test.","She would always encourage us to go to office hours and learn from other sections","Whenever we learn a new topic, she says to talk it out loud to people next to you. So we can learn from each other.","Dr. [Removed] allows us to collaborate during the lectures and create a group of people we can trust with our learning. She then encourages us to meet with people outside of class to help study for exams.","We were working on our lecture notes and Professor [Removed] allowed us to collaborate with our peers and talk about the question. This happened during class, Wednesday 10/2/2024 and she expected us to all work together to understand the problem.","On the first week of classes Dr. [Removed] let us know her expectation for us and how we would interact with our peers. She lets us talk with our peers during class which creates a collaborative environment for learning.","She suggested to make study groups and figure out how you study best and during class we have active learning parts were we work with people near us to figure out solutions.","Study hub was created before every exam and this was super helpful","The instructor set clear guidelines for collaborative activities by outlining specific roles and expectations for peer feedback during group projects. They provided structured rubrics that defined how to give constructive critiques and encouraged us to ask clarifying questions to enhance understanding. This clarity fostered a supportive environment where we felt empowered to engage with one another's ideas, making it an effective model for courses focused on collaboration and mutual learning. \n\n\n\n","The professor gave us a clear syllabus. She explained it in class and explained the expectations.","[Removed] [Removed] really set good expectation on how we should use our peers in order to excel in the class. She would always talk about coming to your peers first and create these study groups that may really help you.","Students were talking during class while she lectured \n It happens daily \n Professor instructs to leave the talking for office hours and outside the classroom","The instructor encourages us to talk to each other and teach each other concepts. During lecture we take 1 or 2 mins to talk questions out with each other. The instructor uses words like \" talk it out \".","We have time in almost every class to talk about the topics we are learning and answer questions with help from peers.","Before quizzes and tests, Mrs. [Removed] always emphasized the importance of studying with peers, noting that collaboration can be highly effective in producing mutual success. Moreover, within lectures, Mrs. [Removed] always designated time so that students could work on in - class questions together. I believe this produces an environment where students are challenged to support and learn from each other.","Dr. [Removed] gives us time in most classes to talk to a neighbor to explain the material to each other. She has told us this is because if you explain something to someone else, you often increase your knowledge. She has also given us times to have collaboration with each other outside of class.","There s many times where we're prompted to discuss with those next to us","The instructor makes students discuss with peers in the class to check if they understand correctly while talking with other students. and through announcements before starting class, instructor talked about resources and strategies to learn.","During class she will often have us turn to the students around us and talk about the concepts to make sure we have an understanding.","Dr. [Removed] implored us to study in groups. This was for the exam we had 2 weeks ago.","Throughout all our units, our professor allows us to talk to peers near by when doing warm ups etc. this helps me ( personally )   understand things better as I get to hear the ways others think.","No GroupMe. Very much TA assisted because it's a big class. Hard to support in a 200 + student class","Dr. [Removed] suggested that we form study groups when going over content for the unit 3 test.","she gives us material which encourages us to study in groups","She would sometimes ask how certain students study or review in order to share tips. This did not happen often, but it still helped when she asked.","Dr. [Removed] has told us to work together on tactless problems and form study groups, especially before tests.","Dr. [Removed] explains how she wants us to talk through problems during class. She does this during class frequently.","Professor mentioned students knew things and should actively ask for advice in discussion settings.","During classes she allows us to collaborate and help each other out by clarifying our doubts or discussing the answer together","She talked about how we should always refrain with each other before ourselves.

Even during class, she has us discuss questions during class with the peers around us.","Dr. [Removed] always reminds us of the resources that are available to us in the beginning of class. She also tells us how collaborating together really helps the content stick in your brain.","tells us to meet eachother during academic communities and office hours. Tells us to turn to talk to our neighbors about the current topic \n","They encouraged us to form study groups, actively participate in talking with peers when given time, and share knowledge with each other respectfully.","She makes it pretty clear when to talk during class and when to not because there is a discrepancy and she always tells us when we are out of place.","During at least one class a week, my teacher will make us collaborate and talk about how to make a diagram or answer questions. She tells us when to talk and what the correct answer is.","The profesor has done this through active learning during class. She additionally has done it through learning modules and at end off unit she emphasizes what is important.","Dr. [Removed] will address the group as a whole, and then give specific instructions to talk to other students. She tells us to collaborate with the people around us, and talk through problems with them.","The instructor always encourages talking about problems discussed in class through \" Active Learning \". This encourages students to not only attempt the problem themselves, but also discuss with other students and perhaps hear a perspective or method they had not tried before.","We very frequently will talk to the people next to us to talk about questions. This usually happens at least once a week. She'll usually just say “ talk to your neighbor about breaking this down. ”","She asks us to study with and reflect with our classmates often","There are multiple opportunities to talk and meet the people that you sit with in class. The professor will ask us to talk with the people in our sections and compare answers of the questions she has asked us to solve during class.

Besides those in class activities there are also academic hours where students can work together and discuss the homework or the assignments.","We are asked to turn to the person sitting next to us and ask them about their weekend, etc.","I don't believe I recall any instances of this.","There are scheduled officer hours everyday and there are also academic communities made to help students study together outside of class","Professor [Removed] encourages us to work together during lectures and on learning modules to ensure that students can learn from one another.","At least once a week and especially during the first couple weeks of the semester, Dr. [Removed] made sure we know it is beneficial to form study groups and go to academic communities to collaborate with both classmates and teaching assistants. She also posted links to TA office hours and where to find and schedule academic community time.","Professor mentions academic communities and making study groups with peers from class.","The instructor has created a multitude of opportunities for collaborative learning. She incorporates it into her lectures and it is called Active Learning and there are academic communities which are specifically designed for collaborative learning.","Dr [Removed] has repeatedly mentioned how beneficial group studying can be for chemistry.","During the beginning of the semester, Dr. [Removed] explained that student with two other specific professors will be learning the same type and style of material as us, and encouraged us to collaborate with them to learn. Additionally, working together during class time for practice problems, encourages us to learn from each other.","Told us to make study groups","She makes us talk to one another and discuss how we got a certain answerr","Encourages study groups. Many opportunities for academic communities and office hours laid out very clearly in a consistent schedule.","She always tell us the best way to learn is my talking with kthers","We turn and talk to partners to help each other remember information in creative ways","She encourages us to work in study groups, attend academic communities and officer hours, and work with students in other sections of the course.

She also encourages studying with your peers to be successful in the class.","We were encouraged to attend study communities or to study together. Because multiple of the chemistry courses were very similar in material, we were also encouraged to study with students from other classes and exchange tips.","Studying together is always better than not studying together. I think it happened last week.","At the beginning of each class [Removed] gives us a breakdown of what we're doing that day. She also makes sure we're working as a team and smoothly.","The instructor allows us to solve problems in groups, thus encouraging that students should support and learn from each other.","In our lab, every \" pod \" is made up of around 4 people, which means we often have to do a lot of teamwork and working together to make sure we've covered everything we need to in lab. The teamwork is facilitated by [Removed] and [Removed] as they answer questions and help out each group when needed.","The instructors go over lab instructions at the beginning of every lab. This often includes working with out whole table or with our partner to perform experiments.","Throughout the course, students work on a poster together as well as blending ideas to get assignments for the poster done. In addition, students are able to learn from each other regarding bacteria growth in lab.","For the quiz [Removed] told us we should go through questions together and learn / gain insight about answers to possible quiz questions. This happened today and [Removed] was telling us to work collaboratively to study.","We have a proper syllabus that goes over course expectations. Furthermore, canvas is always updated with the expectations of the week.","Instructor has said \" you are working as a group and table. You should be helping each other out. \" And encouraged groups to work together and help each other","Very clearly explains what we have to do","The expectations for our lab groups are very clear. There were set early in the year making sure we each contribute and communicate.","We were put into random groups so we are forced to get to know people and work with them. This gives us an opportunity to work with new people, learn from them, and support one another.","In our labs, we are expected to work as a table group. Dr. [Removed] emphasizes teamwork in her announcements and assignments, such as the annotated bibliography where everyone has to contribute and turn in the same page","This entire lab is done with group members. The instructors encouraged this by creating an environment where the group members and instructors are supposed to be working together and talking in order to complete the lab in the 2 hour period.","[Removed] gave us clear instructions in lab about how to prepare for the practical.","He did provide times when we could work as a group for a task.

Additionally, the assignments we work on provide expectations for us as a group and to learn from each other based on responses they had to the same questions.","we work together on all labs.","Through extensive teamwork in the lab, students are encouraged to learn from one another. Doing experiments together is encouraging for real world commitment.","Everything is group based and thus forces collaboration","We work in lab groups. Our instructor emphasizes that we have to work together as a group to have the best outcomes. This occurred during lab.","Students need to work together to reflect on lab activities done as a group. It's happened many times when I can not recall certain details of the lab, but with the help of my lab partners, I was able to figure out.","We work in groups in lab every day and collaborate to achieve a common goal.","Before each lab day, explains what we are doing and how we can help / learn from each other during the lab","The professor gave clear instructions for how the students should work together.","When she had use work in groups she made sure we were ready to help each other and would step in if we looked like we weren't","Working together in teams","We are taught how to do our lab work in a group","In this lab it's all based around group work, so it allows us to contribute our own knowledge to the group.","N / A","Tells that we can study in our lab groups","She clearly told everyone class expectations and what we should do.","The teacher assistant communicates before the lab starts how we should be working with each other to do a task, and how we can split up the task to still retain full understanding","Before every experiment the instructors provide us with clear explanations of what we should or should not do. This allows us to effectively support and learn from each other.","n / a","In discussion sections, assigned tables ( changes after every exam so we can get to know new people ) and highly encourages collaboration ( but no copying! ) for assignments","On the first day of class, Dr. [Removed] made us create a list of classroom expectations that we would follow in order for class to be welcoming and efficient. Each table came up with a few expectations, such as participating, being helpful, and being respectful, and she posted these expectations on canvas so we could always look back at them.","Our instructor tells us which assignments we're allowed to collaborate on and what's expected to be an individual assignment. She also encourages us to talk to each other during class and sometimes has warmup questions about which we discuss in our groups.","She makes it clear that student collaboration is significant and a big factor to success in the class. She put us all in teams based on our discussion sessions and makes us work together. Furthermore, for our quizzes, she lets us use our peers as a resource.","On the first day of class, the instructor asked each table group to provide several examples of classroom rules and expectations for students. Afterward she created a list of these examples and used them as a question in the next quiz to make sure we understood this. This created a positive environment and made sure how we can learn the best in the classroom.","She made us sit in groups and have icebreakers each week. We are comfortable asking each other questions and discussing stuff together.","I don't know if it fits this prompt exactly, but Dr. [Removed] would generally encourage us to discuss a problem in class with each other. This happens almost every single class.","Since the very first day of school up until this very moment, Dr. [Removed] has fostered so much community in her class through emphasizing the importance of colllaboration and communication.

This happened in week 3.","We are paired up in our group of four to do the same lab work twice. We do some things on our own and come together to share our data.","We had to do many assignments as a group outside of class and also pick up soil outside of class. I'd say it is good participation, but it is very hard for us to do that since we are very time constricted.","No TA or professor has made me feel embarrassed or dumb for asking a question. Instead we go through the problem together and find a solution.","When we were signing up for our soil sampling, she encouraged everybody in the group to go together instead of sending just one person.","We work in groups of 4 in the lab, so every class we are working together to do the procedures.

This was always nice!","Since the course has a connection to something that actually is occurring in the real world, antibiotic resistance, it does encourage relevant participation.","All the time, she would encourage us to participate and be active listeners in class, and it really helped retain a lot of the content we would learn in class.","On our class's canvas page, Dr. [Removed] would send out announcement emails every now and then. Those emails would include information about upcoming assignments, advice, as well as information to different events and opportunities out there that we could attend or learn more about. She's given us information about some honors biology societies, piano recitals, research studies we could participate in, and more.","In the beginning of the year, the instructor shared of an organization opportunity in a co - ed fraternity created for those interested in the biological sciences. She linked the application and informed us of approaching due dates for students to involve themselves in the organization.","Weekly discussions, group quizzes, and collaboration over homework problems all serve as examples of this.

He motivated us that we would all do better where no matter what your final grade was, the key part of learning is to truly internalize information, and not just care about your grade.","[Removed] was talking about life experiences as a student He did not do his best in college due to personal struggles but he overcame them to become a professor at physics ( which he failed before ). HIs experience was to highlight that we can always grow and that there are resources to help us out.","The instructor told a story about he himself didn't do well in physics in college with the goal to inspire us students that anything was possible.","Dr. [Removed] frequently recounts stories from his undergraduate physics experience that make me feel more assured in myself and make me appreciate physics more. I feel like I can enjoy the process of learning more when I know that Dr. [Removed] has faced similar problems as me throughout his learning career too.","She has told us about challenges she's faced and overcome in her lifetime that have allowed us to understand her on a deeper level.","Like stated before, today in class [Removed] was open about what she majored in and how you can switch your career path as many times as you want. On average, a person switches their career 5 times and she's done 6.","Gave examples of her own life experiences","Our instructor took the first lecture to introduce himself and the course. He showed us where he studied and taught namely caltech, [Removed], and now here at [Removed].","In the first week of class he shared his story about how he failed his general physics course and how he was able to bounce back from it.","He personally works at [Removed] and works with big telescopes.","He showed us what he does for research outside of [Removed] with his students along with some of the telescopes he's built","Just gave an outline of how he traveled across the nation as a student, grad student, and a professor. How he was inspired once taking up risk and traveling the world to pursue his passion.","He just talks about the research he is doing now and what he did previously. It's nice to hear someone be excited about what they're doing knowing that this is a cool and achievable application to what I am learning.","Our professor shared the challenges he faced in research / his education and his career due to the pandemic. This was during class, and he spoke about how despite these challenges, goals are achievable.","The professor explained how he worked with superconductors in conducting his own research outside of class. This occurred when the topic of superconductors was introduced.","Beginning of the semester was useful to have everyone know that our professor has been in the same shoes as us before and that helped make us a lot more comfortable with our performance","My professor talked about how she failed an exam for the first time in graduate school but still ended up okay","Dr. [Removed] in her physics prerecorded lectures shares her experiences and tell us students how she got into research. She also has an entire 20 minute recording that you can watch in our course website discussing her experience with physics.","[Removed] [Removed] stories","Professor [Removed] has discussed her career path and career ventures. She explained where she had previously attended school and her plans for the future.","Professor [Removed] will often discuss aspects of her career to relate to the class regarding the physics topics we are learning.","they described their career and lab briefly in the begining of the term, giving personal anecdotes.","At the beginning of the course, she was introducing herself and why she got interested into physics. If i remember correctly, she became a professor to research and explained why it was important to her personally. I do not remember the specifics.","Professor [Removed] had talked about her research a few times. This is nice to hear since it allows students to learn more about what the field is like.","I think he talked about not taking a class seriously and how he regretted not going to office hours and after that, he started going and it helped him become a better student. I think it was about a math course, he shared the story so that he could encourage us to attend tutoring.","He told us how he switched majors in college and he working on public speaking","When Professor [Removed] spoke about his work at a school in a town near the border, it made me realize that there were many students that weren't as privileged as me. Yet as an educator, he felt it was his job to ensure that these students were given an equal opportunity for education. I think to emulate this, some professors should relate the material we learn to their own life experiences.","Te instructor talked about how its okay to have more than one job in different fields and how it shows you your true passions."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Dr. [Removed] was talking about how prior to my class she was listening to a podcast and it helps put her in a good mood.","Our professor mentioned her experience at [Removed] [Removed] University and what she was involved in.","The professor gave her back ground and history, saying she went to [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] and more. There wasn't much information other than that given, and we rushed after the syllabus to class work.","Last week, Dr. [Removed] mentioned that she was watching tv and heard them using a chemistry term. I thought it was really funny that she mentioned it out of the blue.","Dr. [Removed] discussed her education, but other than that, not really.","N / A","She introduced herself at the start of the class, so that counts I guess.","This was the first day of class when we were going over the syllabus and the professor was introducing herself.","The instructor has spoken a little bit about her personal life - she has dogs and she enjoys watching jeapordy. Unfortunately since the class is so large, a name to name basis and such similar activities are not practical.","I remember on the first day of class she gave a brief introduction about herself. That might be the only time she has talked about her personal life that doesn't concern her career.","Professor [Removed] shared her experience in college classes. She shared what she did to succeed and how her class sizes impacted her learning experience.","At the start of the class, Dr. [Removed] talked about the football game the week before and her Halloween experience over the weekend.","My professor shared where she went to college and what she majored in. This happened this week. She mentioned that she minored in biology and was telling us about opportunities on campus to minor and receive certificates in health.","Towards the beginning of the semester, Dr. [Removed] would remind us that our test grades do not reflect how well we are at chemistry. She would bring up how she struggled in chemistry back in college and encourage us to keep going.","n / a","My instructor would usually ask about what we thought of the [Removed] games and if we watched it. Then she'd reminisce about her love of watching the games in college and some memories from there.","Dr. [Removed] mentioned how she got a certification in college. She mentioned this to tell us how getting a certification could be beneficial to our future by having that on our resume.","The professor shared most of her personal stories at the beginning of the semester. She has told us that she enjoys football, her undergrad was chemistry, and she has taught classes with fewer students.","She occasionally will talk about her weekend.","Sometimes professor [Removed] will mention something that happened over the weekend such as [Removed] football, or something she did.","She told us about her background and things about her that are interesting to know. She has also told us about some of her schooling experiences","When she was little she was always attracted to the chem lab and all the things inside which helped her see what she wanted to do.","I think I remember her mentioning something about hiking and spending time with family towards the start of the year. Before this, she had us discuss with a partner what we did over the weekend.","The instructor often stops the class and tells us to stop the whispering … but there is no whispering …. So it honestly distracts the class because the professor is always interrupting it.","She hasn't really shared personal stories besides telling us about certain chem topics she learned in high school","At the beginning of the lecture, she'll share little tidbits of her thoughts with us. After [Removed] became ranked number 1 in football she shared how she felt that it was maybe a little presumptuous given we had only played easier teams so far. It elicited a bit of conversation between peers which was a nice way to start the lecture.","Dr. [Removed] provided some background in her undergraduate experience that led up to her now. This included interests as well as clubs that she was in.","On the first class day she introduced herself. She talked about her background, the places she studied, etc.","Our instructor was introducing herself at the beginning of class and as she went through her various life experiences, she shared specific personal stories with our class. I can not remember the exact stories but they regarded her various hometowns and helped us better understand her background before coming to teach at the university.","Dr. [Removed] has shared her interests outside of teaching and chemistry once before. She talked about football and live music in [Removed].","The instructor often shared personal anecdotes related to their hobbies, such as hiking and cooking, during the first few lectures and as icebreakers throughout the semester. For example, they might say, \" Last weekend, I tried a new recipe that reminded me of the chemical reactions we discussed in class, \" encouraging students to relate chemistry to everyday life. This practice helped create a more personable and engaging classroom environment, allowing students to connect with the instructor beyond just the course material.","The instructor has introduced us to her life outside of class when she talks about her interests and where she came from. This allows for a more personable connection to be formed since the lecture hall contains so may people.","Although she doesn't often include personal stories during class, I can remember a time where she told us about her time at her old college and issues she ran into during undergrad of college.","Dr. [Removed] shared a story about her past and how she got interested in chemistry. It was a unique experience that helped me find a connection with her.","I don't remember this happening to be honest.","They talked about their path to becoming a professor.","Professor [Removed] was going over pressure units that we will be using. She retold an anecdote of how no one knows what [Removed] means. She told the story of how her friend had no idea what it meant, so she informed us so we could know for future use.","Sometimes, she'll speak about her experience in her field ; projects she's working / has worked on, her time in school, etc. It doesn't happen super often.","She will make certain comments that let us know about her personal life","She has mentioned medical school and how many things we see in this class can help us in medical school.","The professor discusses current university events, such as the outcomes of sports games, or concerts like [Removed]. I believe this helped us all participate in discussing shared experiences, and made the professor more approachable to students who need academic help","Only happened at the very beginning of the semester as an introduction ; Dr. [Removed] introduced herself, her family, and her field of study.","She would tell use about her books that she listens to on the way to class. She also used a quote from that books and a moment from it to ask us a question and to think about the meaning of it.","In the beginning of the course our professor told us about her passion in chemistry and how she became a professor at [Removed] [Removed].","When Dr. [Removed] was doing electron configuration, she talked about how even after passing general chemistry in college, she still recommends writing out the entire configuration.","She shared about her interest   and experience in this field on the first class","She hasn't really shared much but she always asks how our weeks were. She asks the class if they went to the football game if there is one.","During the previous lecture, which was on October 1st, my professor mentioned that there is certain material in the unit we are learning that she enjoyed when she was a student. she said that her major was in something ( I can not remember the exact name ), but that she spent a good amount of time on certain material she was teaching us. When she said this the class enjoyed it and I took interest in her and viewed her as much more than just my professor. it made her seem more trustworthy and funny to me and it was comforting.","Dr. [Removed] has told us about her love for wellness and about her hobby of listening to podcasts.","During the beginning of the semester [Removed] talked about her what she did growing up and where she was from. I can't remember exactly what she said.","Not anything specific comes to mind but she did briefly share a few things about herself during the first day of class. But after that she hasn't shared anything personal, or any interests outside of her career.","I can not remember","There was not many personal stories made.","I remember Dr. [Removed] tell us about how she studied analytical chemistry a few weeks ago. She tells us her own personal thoughts on which questions topics she think is harder than others which helps us relate with her.","At the beginning of the course, she briefly mentioned her research studies.

She mentioned one time about how she also has a daughter / son to take care of outside of class in a way to connect with us about her experience outside of her career.","My TA often comes over to each table during labs and talks to us while we perform our experiments. My TA will tell us about what she's done over the week or weekend and what kind of work she's doing in her graduate program, which definitely makes me feel like I know her better.","The ta and [Removed] told us a little bit about their future goals to get to know them a little better","One time prior to lab, our instructor told us about a concert she went to and how she lost her voice. It was a funny moment.","When we collected our soil samples she discussed her past with the lab. I also had a discussion there with her about nutrition and dieting.","She shared that she and her daughter were big [Removed] [Removed] fans and that they had attended some concerts in the past. This happened maybe 2 times in the past month.","this was all in office hours and she talked about how she got into research and the type of research she liked","The instructor usually talks one - on - one with students throughout the class and mentions personal stories at times.","We were talking about back surgery the other day and [Removed] came into the conversation.

[Removed] then mentioned that she always encouraged people to do smaller surgeries rather than big surgeries because of a previous job she had.","At the beginning of the semester, [Removed] did a great job in sharing her background stories. [Removed] took her undergraduates degree in [Removed].

For instance, while we were pick and patching, they told us about what they do outside of lab and during their free time.","Dr. [Removed] shared how she was nominated for an award. She also mentioned she liked plants, and I believe her degree has a focus in plants, if I'm not mistaken.","On the first day of class, Mrs. Hall told us a bit about herself including her background as a physical therapist and that her love for research and teaching brought her to the lab setting.   She also told us that her daughter is a sophomore in college which is the average age of our class.","Just as she would walk around the lab, conversations would be brought up that may be something about the song we are listening to, about our weekend, etc. This helped gain insight on each others lives outside the lab.","Our TA shared stories about when she was a student and how she treated her professor, which helped her learn better and even get a recommendation.","Shares music she likes","The instructor shared with us, at the beginning of the year, how she fell in love with biology, and how being a part of a biology lab has led her to where she is today","Shared their favorite podcasts, and their past experiences in work and labs.","Helps humanize the professor and allows us to empathize with them","My instructor once described to us the challenges she faced when she was an undergraduate student outside of the state and the ways she was able to cope with those challenges and persevere. I allowed me to get to know the TA better and understand where she comes from.","They explained why they were pursuing their masters. We got to hear about their specific interest and why they are so interested in that field of research.","I remember near the beginning of the course my instructor shared how she used to do i think physical therapy?

She loves to mention her love for genetics, but she also talks about her outside life. I found it funny when she joked \" [Removed]... [Removed] and I are not related \" because they share the same last name. She is a strong believer in the growth mindset and told us about her time at [Removed] too ( she also graduated from [Removed] - [Removed] )!","This is by far my favourite aspect of Dr. [Removed]'s course! Her stories bring a gentle, empathetic touch that bleeds through all the rigid science, making the class so much more wonderful to take! Her life's story is revealed through her tender and warm nature, and in every smile and encouraging announcement she lifts ALL her students up to their full potential. :)","The only mention of this has been with specific events she has gone to.

This was so real and really allowed me to see that even when I get a bad grade or get an easy question incorrect that it won't completely ruin my career plan.","Once in a while Dr [Removed] will ask how we feel about life and what our strengths are. She implements positive talk to ourselves and makes sure that we all have qualities that define us in a good way that is completely unrelated to genetics.","Dr. [Removed] often speaks of his joy and interest in the moon! We get to see many videos that make him very excited.","Dr. [Removed] at the beginning of the semester simply explained to us his interest in space, specifically the moon, that allotted for his background in physics.","Dr. [Removed] has interest in the moon and has mentioned it a couple of times throughout the class and has said he teaches other courses relating to the moon.","He always talks about the moon.

This happened during introductions on the first day of classes and he also utilizes space in physics examples which I think is a fun and interesting challenge.","I believe that at the beginning of class, the instructor would introduce a topic by relating it to his interests with space.","Dr. [Removed] loves talking about the moon, and he always shows us how physics relates to things happening on the moon or space - related things. When he was encouraging us to not take mistakes too seriously, he used a clip from a movie about one of the [Removed] missions. At the beginning of the semester, he also talked about his interests like going to all 50 states. These all happen during lecture and kind of act as an intro. I appreciate it because sometimes I show up a little late, and it's cool to see his passion for the moon.","In the course, the instructor occasionally shared their fascination with the moon and stargazing, even mentioning how they took their telescope out to observe lunar phases.

My instructor expressed some of this during his introduction.","Told us about his interest in space and the moon.","In our course, the instructor frequently shares his passion for the moon, which helps us connect with him on a personal level.   His enthusiasm for astronomy makes the class more engaging and shows that he values sharing personal interests beyond just the academic material. This approach not only fosters a welcoming classroom atmosphere but also encourages students in other courses to see their instructors as relatable individuals with diverse interests.","he shared his passion / interest for astrology / astrophysics with us","I believe this was at the beginning of the semester. We were talking about how many people fear physics, but he explained how learning from your mistakes can help you grow. He explained how he's made mistakes in the past too.","On the first day of class, Dr. [Removed] introduced himself and his hobbies. He also gives us fun facts about space missions almost every day which I enjoy.

But she always reassures that either way is fine.","The instructor told us what did she do before she became a professor but I forgot what exactly she said.","Dr. [Removed] explained to us that she sometimes still struggled with molecular shapes of molecules and shared a 3D app that she found beneficial and that we would most likely also find very beneficial.","She talked a little bit about her journey in chemistry to get to being a professor in chemistry. She did this about a month ao in a lecture. She said something about her time teaching classes prior to our class and her time learning years ago.","In lecture, she's mentioned a topic in chemistry that she struggled with","I have never heard her share a challenge.","Dr. [Removed] has shared general struggles with us, I do not actually recall a specific event of this however, sorry, I just know that she definitely has.","Describe challenges during her university years, how they overcame them, and give tips.","The instructor shared that she struggled with a certain topic in chemistry while she was pursuing her undergraduate studies.

This happened about two weeks ago","A challenge they encountered in their career was that they always wanted to do chemistry, but were unsure on how to get there. This happened in one of our very first classes at the beginning of the term.","In our chemistry class, the instructor shared a personal story during a lecture on complex reactions. It was about how they struggled with organic chemistry in graduate school, nearly failing a key exam. They explained that they overcame this challenge by seeking help from a study group and adopting spaced practice, emphasizing to us, \" Failure isn't final ; it's just feedback. \" This happened midway through the semester when many of us were feeling overwhelmed by the material, and it really helped motivate the class.","She told us a little bit about herself. The professor allowed us to hear her story about how she became the lady she is today.","They challenge by making us practice molecular structure and knowing there angles and names","The instructor said how she wasn't good at chemistry when she was in college. She then told us she had to change her studying habits in order to achieve the grade she got.","She talked about how when she went to college what she thought of general chemistry and how she handled it. This really helped me with my own approach to [Removed] chem.","Usually, as a method to encourage us, our professor would use herself as an example when she was studying chemistry like us. It helps a lot knowing that even the professors make mistakes.","A challenge was trying to change my way of studying after the first exam. THis was able to be done with resources provided by [Removed].","I briefly remember Dr. [Removed] explaining a learning device she used to help her remember hydrogen bonding types, [Removed].

People are able to gather with others and learn at the same time.","At the start of most of the lectures, the professor has an ice - breaker type of question where we can talk with the people around us. This allows us to share our interests and get to know each other.","The instructor had us ( 300 + students ) turn to a partner and share a little bit about our weekend. This was at the beginning of the course and hasn't happened since.","We discussed where we would like to travel to the person next to us as an icebreaker","She did this at the first lecture where she said \" turn to your neighbor and discus with them what you like to do in your freetime. \" This allowed me to make a few new friends in the class.","In the beginning of lecture we were prompted to discuss what we did over the summer","Before our class starts, I really appreciate how we are given a few minutes to talk with the people around us. One of the questions we talked about was \" Where would you like to travel? Internationally and domestically. \" Not only was this a great way to start the class, I felt like it cleared my mind because the day does build up during the afternoon and getting to talk about traveling made me think about positive times during the summer or winter break where I got to relax for vacation.","Sometimes before class begins, Dr. [Removed] asks us a question in which we share our answers with our neighbors. Although I can't recall every question, the most recent she asked was about where our favorite place to travel was.","During the course, questions about our major and other extracurricular activities have been presented as a way to allow us to become more comfortable in the environment. This is not limited to one specific time within the class. Even outside of the class, there have been opportunities posted through the stream which help encourage interests / activities outside of the course.","In almost every lecture, Dr. [Removed] gives us time to talk through concepts with out neighbor and talk about ourselves.","At the beginning of the semester and frequently throughout the semester, the professor would ask students to talk to their neighbors and share a fun fact or something interesting they had done recently.","The first week she told us to turn to someone near us and share about ourselves.","There are several ice breaker questions intended to be discussed among nearby peers.

Students talked amongst themselves and a few shared out to the class.","At the beginning of each class, as an icebreaker, she'll have us talk to the person sitting next to us about a certain topic. Some days its based on what we are learning and others its about our personal lives : \" if you could travel anywhere, where would you go? \"","This occures when she does active learning and ask about our day and tells us to talk about it with our neighbor. This could be what we did for the weekened, how good the weather is, or how we're feeling.","i can not remember a specific time","Instructor encouraged students to join chemistry organizations she's a part of.","We sometimes start the week off with an ice breaker / time to talk. Usually with a specific question about what we did","The professor sometimes gives students the opportunity to talk to others a the beginning of class.

We did not share the information with the instructor, only with our classmates sitting around us.","There's usually times to share thoughts every class with each other","Our instructor has us turn to the people next to each other at the beginning of some classes and had us talk about ourselves and our lives multiple times. For example, she would ask people to share about their weekend or the football game.","In one of the first few classes, she asked the students in the lecture hall to share what they had done over the summer or were doing that weekend. WE were also asked to share any talents or interests with the students around us.","On the first day of class Dr. [Removed] encouraged us to get to know our classmates by sharing about our summer and our interests. She also asked us to talk to our partners about a topic we know well enough to coach in order to introduce a new study technique. She also has posted external opportunities to learn about chemistry outside of this course.","The professor is strict on staying quiet most of the time in hopes of completing the course content within the lecture time. She spends a lot of time hushing us when I don't notice whispering as a distraction.","Professor [Removed] likes to talk with us prior to starting lecture and the materials. She asks us questions about our days, how the weekends were, what are plans are, and other simple questions to get our lecture started. This happens every lecture or at least one of the days we are in her lecture.","In a warm - up, we were asked to share about our weekend to our peers sitting near us. We were given time to discuss amongst ourselves before diving into course content.","The instructor gives us a few minutes to talk to the people sitting near us and share what we did over the week / weekend.","During the beginning of each class Dr, [Removed] provides any important announcements first then lets the students talk about their weekend or about the announcements.","At the beginning of the semester, Prof. [Removed] did allow us to introduce ourselves to each other and spark a deeper conversation ( beyond asking for name, major, hometown, etc. ) about who we are, our hobbies, what we're good at or enjoy doing, etc. in an effort to encourage conversation. It was welcomed, since being in a lecture hall with several hundred people, she can't speak to all of us.","Dr. [Removed] usually jumps right into the lecture. She typically does not engage in the personal lives of the class","The instructor sometimes gives us a short period to talk to the people next to us about random things happening in our lives. This is meant to be fun and an icebreaker for getting to know each other.","Our professor allows us to ask questions and participate in class.","In office hours, she allows us to better understand these concepts by thinking or coming up with ways to remember them in our everyday lifes.

Since the class is so big we did not share our interests aloud but we still got to know some information about our classmates.","I don't think I recall this specifically. That does not mean it didn't happen.","On the first day of school, Dr. [Removed] provided a time during class to introduce ourselves with the people sitting beside us, giving us a moment to' Think, [Removed] and [Removed]'.","When it comes to the new week the professor always asks if we did anything this weekend and gives a a few moments to share with those that are around us. She even talks about what she did too so we can stay engaged with her.","Dr. [Removed] asked the lecture hall how their weekend was and some surface level questions. Throughout the lecture, she also has us pair and share, whether it be about chemistry topics, or about our own lives and how it can be applicable to chemistry.","Sometimes at the start of class professor caudill will give us a question to talk with our peers about. For example, last week we were asked “ what is your dream vacation destination? ”","At the beginning of class one day, Dr. [Removed] allowed us to have a quick break in order to talk to the students around us about our weekends and our hobbies. This allowed the students to get to know others around them and have a little mental health break in class which I thought was beneficial because chemistry can be hard at times, so being able to talk to new people around you gives the students a brain break and a reset before the actual lecture starts.","She would talk about clubs that were looking for members. This is a way for us to know ways we can broaden our interests.","At the start of the semester in the first few lecture periods, students were asked to share personal information with their neighbor. This was in an attempt to help students to make friends in the class and get to know each other.","Similar to conversations we have during the week of exams, Professor [Removed] allows us to share about our personal lives before the start of class.

For example, one day, the instructor said, “ If anyone has something cool they're working on or learned recently, feel free to share — it's always great to see how science connects to other parts of our lives. ” This welcoming approach helped build a sense of community and allowed us to connect with each other beyond course content.","At the start of the semester, the instructor would provide \" [Removed] [Removed] \" questions for students to get to know each other.","At the beginning of class, while she is setting up, Dr. [Removed] always encourages us to discuss what we are doing outside of class with our neighbors. This helps foster relationships with those around us which is incredibly important in her class given that their is so much collaboration involved.","asked about our weekend of halloween","The instructor encourages us to visit office hours outside of the course in order to learn more about questions and topics that interest us. She also recommends that we practice on our own to enable us to fully grasp the concept in a way we can best understand.","This happened on the first day of lab when the lab instructor told us to introduce ourselves to our lab group. This made our lab group to know each other better and activities that we are part of so that we   have an idea of each others schedules may be like for later on in the semester.","[Removed] and [Removed] help facilitate great teamwork and connections with our tables in lab.","Warm greetings and open communication.","I think the best example of this was when we were collecting soil for our experiments at the field center. Our instructor encouraged us to project our interests in soil collection and contribute our passions to our research.","In my bio lab course, the instructor would periodically ask us to share our interests or activities outside of class, typically during the first few minutes of lab or after we completed an experiment early. For example, at the beginning of the semester, the instructor asked everyone to introduce themselves and mention a hobby or something interesting they were working on outside of the lab. Later on, after a group presentation, the instructor encouraged us to relate the project to any extracurricular activities or personal interests, saying, \" It's important to connect your passion for science with what you love outside the lab. \" This helped create a more relaxed, collaborative environment where we could see how our diverse interests influenced our approach to learning science.","When she is at each table we talk about lab but I also feel comfortable asking / talking about other things.","Sometimes during labs we will chat with our instructor about our hobbies outside of the course. For example, we would discuss other extracurriculars or courses we were taking.","[Removed] allows us to freely chat everyday while we are working on the lab, which allows us to talk about our interests or activities outside the course. They also have a playlist for the lab, where students can share their music tastes and add songs onto a playlist, which we play daily","It was the for the first day of lab. We sat at tables with groups so we did an ice breaker to get to know each other. It was nice because it made the lab feel less tense.","She often asks about what we do over the weekend and is curious to learn more about our lives outside of the classroom.","The LA and [Removed] usually go around checking on the groups and engaging them in small talk.

Icebreaker time in the first lab and recently told to talk about our weekend plans.","There's not really that much opportunity but we get to talk to our peers during lab.","In this course the way that my instructor has allowed students an opportunity to share our interests or activities outside of the course is through group work. In our lab, we work in groups every single lab. This allows us to communicate with each other. However, I actually do not think that our instructor ever encouraged us to talk with each other.","when giving introduction to our lab group","Getting to know you assignments for extra credit","We have been talking about our outside interests within our table and she has come to provide input to the conversation.

This has made lab very enjoyable and allowed me to bond with my lab partners.","I'm not entirely sure she gave the opportunity to the whole class, but when she comes to our table, I sometimes talk to her about what I learned in other classes that were relevant regarding the concepts behind the procedures. Our table would also ask questions about her personal life, such as her plans for the weekend and we would converse about that.","As mentioned previously, Dr. [Removed] wants to get to know her students and encourages them to visit during office hours. [Removed] also encourages students to attend office hours, but I have not visited with her about interests or activities outside of this course.","Every Mondays Dr. [Removed] asks students to share what they have done of the past weekend.

Also, she always lets us know what events are going on and whether or not she'll be attending.","She always wants to talk to us outside of class. She tells us that she enjoys seeing us and is welcomed to any topics as long   as they are outside of lecture time.","I am not sure of an exact reference.","This happened at the beginning of the semester as we were doing \" ice breakers \" to get to know each other.

She does this every class. Dr. [Removed] uses ice breakers to create a tight - knit and inclusive environment where everyone feels they belong.","The professor often gives us ice breaker questions to get to know the people in our table and class a little better. They're usually random but simply questions and are fun to answer.","We had icebreakers at the beginning of class. We were able to discuss things that we enjoyed.","Sometimes, she'll give us questions unrelated to class to talk about to our peers. We have talked to our peers about our interests before.","Every few class periods we have an icebreaker question to discuss with our classmates. We also have the ability to discuss with classmates during instapolls ( and sometimes we would go off topic )","During the HW there is always a question that lets us connect our intrests to the course material. We answer a form of this question each week when we turn in our HW.","One specific instance was when the instructor assigned us to write a brief reflection about our passions and interests outside of genetics. This assignment encouraged us to think about what motivates us and how those interests might intersect with our studies.","We were given an extra credit activity where we shared our goals and hobbies and other activities that we enjoyed, this was given around the 5th class week.","[Removed] projects with the lab groups have been useful to brush up on concepts.","She gave us icebreakers to talk with our classmates","Before some lectures, the instructor would provide us with time to talk with our peers, encouraging us to share our interests and personal experiences. A few weeks ago, she also assigned us a reflective writing exercise where we outlined our future goals and aspirations.","In discussion section","It was an ice breaker with our group. We had to find things we had in common. This was the first week of school.","The TA for my section does ice breakers at the beginning of every discussion section so that we can connect with peers","Dr. [Removed] would do ice - breakers every class period and ask various prompts about our interests and encourage us to make peer connections.","First day icebreakers wer introduced our interests outside academic setting.","Whenever we do instapolls she calls on groups to share their answers","Dr. [Removed] has had two exit tickets that essentially allow us to give a part of ourselves in writing for her, so she can get to know us. Dr. [Removed] wants to understand our passion and goals in life.","The professor will often send us links to outside activities such as piano recitals or science talks. She is giving us an opportunity to find things outside of the course that we enjoy doing.","Dr. [Removed] has provided her students with small essay prompts a couple of times as an \" exit ticket \", which has allowed us to share our interests. We have also been able to discuss our future plans after college and aspirations.","After finishing our midterms we do something similar to a reflection where we talk about ourselves in an anonymous survey, so she can better understand us.","She always sends announcements each week in which she promotes any events that might be of our interest. One instance I remember was the [Removed] bash where we get to meet the biology faculty! It was pretty fun and meet people in my major.","On our homework sets she has us answer a question of how these concepts apply to our life personally or why they're important to us.","At the beginning of class, we had an icebreaker where we were asked to share about the most recent movie we saw in theaters and how we would rate it. We talked about it in groups, and then, Dr. [Removed] invited a few people to share.","About once a month, students complete an \" exit ticket \" assignment at the end of a class.

It happened a few weeks ago. She encouraged us to write anything we want, and that she wanted to know more about all of us.","For each of our homework assignments, there is a reflection question that we must answer. This reflection question has three different options that you can choose from to answer. One of the options is along the lines of \" What have we learned in this module that correlates with something professional on the outside? \". This question allows me to apply what we have learned to [Removed], which is the profession that I want to go into after I complete my studies.","In office hours he is very receptive and asked me about my future plans.","Friendly community that encourages conversation and sharing interests","The instructor talked about certain interesting work he was doing such as a class about the moon and said students could come if they are interested. This happened at the beginning of the course. Also, the instructor has offered students to come to office hours to talk about their interests.","Dr [Removed] gives us moments in class to share ideas with others and relate physics to real life.","When Dr. [Removed] sheriff is interest in class about astronomy and space, he also gives us the space to also share their own interests outside of class and then connected to how that could be interpreted in physics.","He just asks us to talk to our neighbors which gives us an outlet to talk to someone about things other than school. \n","He has us apply what we learn to our real lives.","On [Removed] Discussion, there are multiple threads where students can share their thoughts.

But it is okay because this course is a lot content wise so I prefer focusing on that during class to get all my questions answered.","Dr. [Removed] reached out to me to check in about mid - semester. This was super thoughtful and allowed me to reflect on myself in the course and get feedback and support from a professor who truly cares about his students and well - being.","Our teacher did this on the first day of class, and sometimes before class he will tell us to talk to our neighbor about what we are doing outside of class.","My instructor usually begins a lecture by saying \" Talk to your neighbors and ask them how they are doing \".

In office hours we can talk about anything, doesn't have to be about the course.","We had an introduction assignment at the beginning of the course that required you to share a fun fact about you that no one else would know. It wasn't explicitly to share your interests but I think everyone I saw ended up doing that.","At the start of the semester we did some ice breaker activities and had the chance to do this.","Promoted using students' civil voices before the election.","Project allows students to choose data set they're interested in","Through instapolls, sometimes open ended questions help in putting my interests as answers.","We had to make a video introducing ourselves to some of our peers.","The instructor created an icebreaker video assignment.

We don't do too much of this, though.","I realized it happened before September 26th but it was too late. It was in the beginning of the course where we self - recorded videos as ice breakers.","I think this happened in a lecture where one of the students had a much greater depth of knowledge on a topic that the dataset was related to which allowed them to give us greater insight because of their background.","She gives us a project that we can do any interest on our own. She makes sure to tell us to not do something academic.","This happened during a stats survey in class to help represent the data.

She encourages us to choose a topic we are curious or passionate about, giving prompts such as \" What is the most interesting thing you have learned in a class at this university, \" and \" What is a topic our society knows too little about? \" At the end of the semester, we are expected to present a poster on this topic where we can share our research with our classmates.","For our final statistics project, she makes sure to have students reflect on topics and things that they personally really like.","There was never really an opportunity for students to share their interests in class outside of the class. We stayed very on task during class.","This happened when people would talk about having similar interests to some of the problems we worked on. For example, one of the problems was related to video games and a student shared their interest.","The semester - long project provides an opportunity to use the tests and concepts learned in class as applications to something outside the class that they are interested in.","For research project, our instructor encouraged us to explore topics to do our research over. She encouraged us to pick a topic that we could talk about off the top of our head for 15 minutes","Our project that we work on allows us to incorporate our interest into it. We get to pick any topic and create research questions regarding the data we find about the topic. It is a great way to keep us engaged and interested in the class.","She likes to ask our name and fun facts about ourselves.","For an extra credit assignment, we were able to introduce ourselves to the class and say a topic we are excited to learn about. Dr. [Removed] also sometimes shares different events and clubs on [Removed].","The instructor came up with an idea for an extra credit assignment with the question \" tell me about a hobby you enjoy \".

He also had some times where he showed us a question about the differences in mindsets when it comes to something like physics or science.","We have the opportunity for lots of group collaboration in lectures and in discussion.

So I would not say that she does this.","Dr. [Removed] opens the lecture with non - lecture related topics. She usually asks about students' weekends, extracurriculars, as well as letting students know about the opportunities on campus.","My professor has asked us once or twice to discuss icebreaker questions. I believe one of them was sharing how we chose our major. I got to share with my neighbors and I always love hearing other peoples stories. This happened at a bit of a random point in class, kind of like a brain break which I actually enjoyed. It would be nice to have a 5 minute break to talk to my peers in the middle of class each day.","The teacher was very engaging at the beginning of lecture. They asked us to share with the people around us what we did over the weekend.","I remember on the first week of class she gave us time to talk to the people next to us to get to know them and to make some acquaintances in the class room.","Every now and then, [Removed] tells us to talk to the person next to us about things outside of class, for example, what country would you like to travel to or what hobbies are you interested in.","She had us do some icebreakers with questions related to this in the start of the semester","N / A","It was the between the first two weeks of the semester and as a polling question, since we haven't learned most of the content for the course, she asked us about something from our past. She asked us to ask around about the question and then asked if anyone would like to share.","Every day in the beginning of class, we are given a few minutes to talk to those around us about what happened to us that was fun in the period of time from the previous class to the current class. It helps us ease into the lecture \n","In the beginning of lecture, [Removed] will often check up on us as a class and ask us questions about life","On more than a few lectures, she would ask us to converse with people next to us regarding outside of class topics, like weekend plans, or places we've been in the past travel wise. This was part of her self described warm up process to help us mentally cleanse before diving into that day's material","In the first week of class, I remember Professor [Removed] telling us to talk to our neighbors about what places we would go on vacation. While I was talking to my neighbors, I learned that two of them were from New [Removed].","Around the beginning of class in the first two to three weeks, Dr. [Removed] asks students to share with the person next to them a special hobby or talent and what they've learned from their experience. On another occasion, Dr. [Removed] asks her students to share with the person next to them a place / country they want to visit and why.","On the first day of class, we were asked to share something special about ourselves that we are goos at outside of school.","At beginning of lecture - icebreaker was to discuss weekend experiences with peers.","My instructor has previously asked us to write and share a response to a question regarding our experiences in life. For instance, I remember her asking about what destination was our favorite place to travel to at the beginning of class.","When one on one conversations are had.","At the beginning of the semester with people around us. I think it was just icebreakers.","Before the lecture starts, the professor would ask the students to talk amongst themselves about what they did during the weekend or other experiences","During the first couple weeks of school, Dr. [Removed] would ask the class questions to help her know the class a little better. She did polls on students' years and why they were taking the course. She would also ask the students verbally to share why they're taking the course if they would like to share.","She would have us share things at the beginning of class. Things like how our weekend went, what we did, how we feel about the course, etc.","in the beginning of class time she would allow us to warm up to our other classmates to be more comfortable in the class","Every monday for the first few minutes she asks people what they did over the weekend. If there was a [Removed] football game that weekend, she will talk about how the team is doing with some students","This hasn't happened, but also the lecture hall is massive","On the first or second day of class she told the class to tell the person next to them something they are very good at. This gave the opportunity for people to share their background and past experiences.","Not sure","In the beginning of the semester [Removed] gave us the opportunity to speak to someone next to us and share something we are good at.","We have little icebreakers at the beginning of each lecture. That's pretty much it.","Does not pertain to the course. Gave us at the beginning of classes however it has deceased.","During the first day, Mrs. [Removed] encouraged students to talk amongst their neighboring peers about their past experiences, whether it was simply naming their favorite song or even discussing their favorite summer memory. I believe activities like this encourage students to become more connected with one another and develop bonds that they may have otherwise never formed.","At the beginning of the year, as part of an introduction exercise, we were encouraged to share information about ourselves with them. Thanks to this, the class has felt more personalized.","On the first day of class for the semester, Dr. [Removed] asked students to introduce ourselves to our peers around us, stating our favorite hobbies and career we want to pursue in the future. I was able to learn about the hometown and major of the individuals around me.","This happened more so at the beginning of the semester, but sometimes she would have us talk to other people about random prompts she would give us.

Or during a question period, she would ask us to create an example with our prior knowledge.","Dr [Removed] asked us to refer back to previous chem knowledge several times throughout the semester. She does this to help us connect the dots better. \n","Dr. [Removed] asked students to share something about their backgrounds and past experiences with chemistry at the start of the semester. This happened during the first week, when Dr. [Removed] said, \" Understanding where you're coming from helps me support you better in this course. \" This allowed students to reflect on their previous experiences and feel more connected to the class, making it easier to relate to the material and engage in discussions.","At the beginning of the course, one of the first few classes we had, we were asked to turn to our neighbor and share a little bit about ourselves. This was just used as a sort of icebreaker and to help introduce us to those sitting nearby.","On the first day 8/26, we were asked to share with a peer something that we are good at.","In the beginning of the course the instructor asked us to turn to the student next to us and share something we were really good at, and the process it took to become really good at what we chose to share.","We only did this on the first day or two of class. I can't remember exactly what we did, but it was something about sharing a fun fact about ourselves or what we did over the summer.","She made us turn to our neighbor and share","She often has little introductory questions to the day, asking general feelings at the time and how students are doing.

I also feel the perusals offer you chances to share your personal experiences.","She asked about our academic backgrounds, like what majors we were and what kinds of things we liked to do. This happened about a month and a half ago.","Near the beginning of the term, the instructor wanted everyone to introduce themselves with others to create a welcoming environment to all students in the lab. The instructor also shared her background to engage with the students.","At the start of the course, the instructor asked each of us to introduce ourselves and share any previous lab or research experience we had. This helped set the tone for the semester, as the instructor said, “ Understanding your background will help me tailor the course to your needs and create a better learning environment. ” This sharing helped us connect with each other and allowed the instructor to gauge our comfort levels with the material, creating a more personalized and supportive learning experience.","Instructor made it clear on the first day she is here for us if needed and is very approachable / understanding of different background experiences.","I personally have never shared anything about our background nor past experience in this course.","The instructor encourages group discussion that can set the scene to share background information and how it connects to what we are doing.","Some people coming into our lab had never taken a lab before at [Removed] or had no prior research experience, while many others have completed [Removed] [Removed] lab already or had worked in other labs.

She also has icebreakers for the pods to do!","At the beginning of every class, the instructor sets aside around 10 minutes for icebreakers with our assigned tables. This allows us to share more about ourselves and realize similarities between our classmates.","Sometimes before the lecture starts, Dr. [Removed] will show a slide that has an icebreaker of some sort. Through this, we share about our experiences or background.","Dr. [Removed] provided us with a writing activity that allowed us to share with her anonymously about our values in life and why we cherish them. This activity allowed us to display why we care about things that affect us and how our experiences guide us to who we want to be.","In a reflection activity from this past week, my instructor asked us to share about our values. She then asked us to delve in deeper about how our values have connected to an important event or moment in our lives, clearly demonstrating an example of her asking students to share about their background.","After each midterm, Dr. [Removed] allows us to do an extra credit activity where we write about our values or goals for the future. This is how she gets to know us better","Dr. [Removed] gives us prompts [Removed] sometimes bi - weekly that give us a chance to share our past experiences with the members of our table. It's a really great chance to make connections in the clas and get to know your classmates on a deeper level.","At the beginning of every class, she will ask something about ourselves as an icebreaker. She encourages our teams / tables to share things about ourselves.","Start the class off with icebreaker questions in which she encouraged people among their group to exchange past history from their selves such as favorite color, animal, how their week went etc.","She handed out papers and asked us to answer a few questions about ourselves and our future goals to get to know us better. She's done this twice","Normally, the class before or after an exam we will do an exit ticket which allows us to reflect on our behaviors and express what our goals are. In these exit tickets we can express whatever we want, and typically it asks us to tie our background and morals into our personal goals for the future.","Sometime during the semester, the instructor had an icebreaker or question that extended to any research that any students know about and are willing to share.","Dr. [Removed] is always checking in on us, especially in discussion times and even in class with ice breakers. She has many times expressed her interest in learning about out backgrounds and our futures as well.","Dr. [Removed] told us to write our passion and ambitions onto a sheet of paper and she would go and read all of them later that day. This happened right before our first midterm as a means to relieve our stress from the courseload.","At the start of class, Dr. [Removed] would sometimes ask if we did anything interesting since the last class. It would be a quick moment for anyone to briefly shout out something that they did. In addition, Dr. [Removed] would have us fill out a survey inquiring about our goals and experiences so she can learn more about us and our backgrounds.","She would ask us to share in class.","We've talked about our background in the first few weeks of class, and we often talk about it in office hours.","Gave us a piece of paper as extra credit where we would write down our goals in life, our virtues, and to think of ways that we can excel and become the person we would like to be in the future.","Does this in the reflective assignments. I love Dr. [Removed].","We do reflections after every exam and it relates to our lives","Sometimes she makes us write reflections about our journey in learning. In my opinion this is great and I like how she says she reads them all.","Dr. [Removed] will give us opportunities to talk to her about our backgrounds and past experiences when we do reflections, typically after exams. She doesn't require this, but we always have the chance to talk to her about how we feel.","In discussion sections, ice breakers were used the first day so we could get to know each other and this was one of the questions that was asked.","After tests we usually have an optional reflection that we do in class anonymously. In that reflection, we can share our background or past experiences and how it affects us today","The professor is very thoughtful of the students and make us get to know each other. He encourages us to talk to each other.","I believe during the first class Professor [Removed] asked us about our past physics experience including classes in highschool","N / A","During the first week of school as he was explaining his background and hobbies he took the time to inquire about our backgrounds. Also during many problems, he tries to incorporate real - life scenarios that students face to explain concepts.","Dr. [Removed] has asked us to shared about our past experiences with numerous physics and algebra concepts during lectures. This helped him in determining how detailed he needed to be on the lecture that day.","The professor asked us what experiences we've had taking physics in the past on the first day of class. We did a class poll to demonstrate how much previous physics and [Removed] knowledge we have.","Dr. [Removed] had us describe our previous physics experiences if we had any. He asked us to share the good, the bad, and the ugly so we could all gain a clearer understanding of the wide range of backgrounds in physics that were present in the class.","He asks have we evry learn physics before   this class, and asks use if we every did certain activity that involve physics, loke [Removed]. He likes to be engaging with the audience / students.","he's very open minded to student's viewpoints","Mostly during supplemental instructional periods we are able to discuss more personal matters in which the conversation was guided back to ourselves. This isn't always possible in class simply because of the logistics of it, almost 100 students in a single hour lecture would take up the entire hour.","pointed me to resources for help with my family situation","Multiple times during reflections and other activities he asks us to draw on previous experiences we've had and how we have overcome adversity or used a growth mindset to help us improve.","During the first lecture, the instructor asked the class about what previous physics classes they've taken and when. Students answered in [Removed] discussion.","When he talked about torque and ramp examples.","He asks us to relate what we're learning to our dad ily life. Especially when he talks about macromolecules and he asks us to think about the meals we ate.","During our third unit ( [Removed] ), Dr. [Removed] brought up the effectiveness of creatine on the human body. After doing so, he asked students if any had personally taken creatine previously to enhance their workouts.","The instructor will usually ask students if they have visited a particular national park or watched certain documentaries. I believe that this was likely done to compliment the material presented in the lecture.","Professor [Removed] asks us to relate content we are learning with aspects of our lives, primarily through asking us where we have been such as the [Removed] [Removed]. This has happened multiple times as a way for him to help us relate the content to real life examples.","When he's teaching he uses our life moments to teach so we can understand better.","He asked who owned a fancy car, I believe it was like a porche and allowed students to answer.","One example included the first few lectures of class, where we used personal information such as height to participate in example codes. We are never forced to share [Removed] personal details we may be uncomfortable sharing.","On the first day of class, my instructor asked if any classmates have worked with coding specifically R [Removed] in the past. She encouraged the class to explore coding and datasets as we learned throughout the class as well.","She always makes us feel good and gives a good class experience.","I can't remember what was said and done in the course specifically","[Removed] has us take an intro survey to get to know us better.","Ask us to discuss about ourself related to the topic in class most likely when doing some type of data analysis","Is there anything fun going on? Ensuring a safe environment.","There was an introduction video assignment. They asked about a fun fact.","We had an intro video assignment. We shared about ourselves in the assignment.","She interacts with the students and asks them how their week has been and what they have been up to in the past week. She wants to get to know the students and encourage more interaction.","I believe during the first week of classes we were on zoom and did an activity where we shared facts about ourselves with a small group. I think she asked us to share our majors, year, and a fun fact.","Our professor will move around the class during downtime to converse with students and ask them about how their day is going / plans / activities they're enjoying outside of class. It shows a genuine interest in getting to know her students and their non - academic lives. This mostly occurs during downtimes, but sometimes a student will have expertise in a topic we're analyzing so they get to provide further insight when encouraged by the professor.","She definitely did this at the beginning of this course and she helped all feel comfortable.","Allows a lot of student participation and feedback in class.","The only instance of this that I can remember is in the first survey that she used to get to know everyone better. Beyond that, she wouldn't force anyone to tell her these things, and only if they were willing to.","I think when talking about the project we will complete at the end of the course, she encourages us to choose something that interests us","When she prompted us to fill out the a survey at the beginning of the year. As it detailed some of things / hobbies we had in the past.","We are in groups every class so we get to know one another. This is where I have shared my background and past experiences with others.","She just asks us to socialize with our groups.","Sometimes she will have us recall on past experiences and how it applies to what we are learning. I don't remember this happening often though.","Not applicable","Someone talked about games in class, and the instructor engaged with them. We were doing work on statistics of games at gamestop","The extra credit assignment in the first week asked students about their interests.","We simply introduced ourselves during our discussion period. We played two truths and a lie where we shared something about ourselves.","During discussion sections, students can connect with the TAs personally due to the small groups. Additionally, the instructor does ask students questions that are based on prior knowledge if applicable ( e.g., asking students for the name of a species or, the name of a concept ).","I can't remember specific details","In the beginning of the semester we were asked about our background experience with using different data interpreting softwares.","In an extra credit activity we were allowed to introduce ourselves and a fun fact about us.","She had us do an assignment the first or second week of class that was an introduce ourselves video. This included sharing something about ourselves and why we are in the class.","In the beginning of the semester, the instructor passed around papers that asked if you took similar classes, had experience in certain programs, etc. After we filled out the paper, she asked us to mix themn around with other students and then went through the questions so everyone's answers would be anonymous.","She did give us an opportunity for extra credit to record ourselves and share something about ourself to the classz","She posted an extra credit assignment where we briefly introduced ourselves and provided comments on our video.","Asked in relation to their topic on how it relates to them.","I don't remember when this happened. It was early in the semester but also some check - ins more recently. She asked what our experience was with excel and data analysis. With those responses she created a ton of resources for those of use who are new to the sort of data analysis we do in ecology.","On our first day, our instructor asked us whether any of us were international students or if [Removed] was not our first language. This was anonymized by trading the papers we wrote our answers on with 2 other people.","At the beginning of the semester she offered an extra credit assignment where we got to say what our names were and some facts about our background. She went through each video and replied to all her students.","In the beginning, we talked about ourselves to introduce ourselves. Sometimes we use our own examples to better understand a topic!","Our instructor would ask students to share information about their past experiences or backgrounds. Some students came from a Jewish background and knew [Removed] already, and some did not, so they were learning [Removed] for the first time in class. It was important and helpful to know what past experiences and what background students came from because it helped our instructor provide to everyone what they needed.","She starts the class with a question that does not always relate to the class subject as an icebreaker. For instance, one time she asked who was our favorite artist.","The instructor shared her background and past experiences on the first day of school. She told us about her hardships as a woman in STEM and asked us as a class about our background and past experiences.","did not really happen","Not sure","This happened after the first midterm. The instructor asked us to think back on times we struggled through our classes and what we did to overcome those struggles.","Dr. [Removed] asked students that were interested in healthcare to help her identify an application of speed of rotation found in healthcare. Students identified a surgical drill.","She always talks about her background and encourages us to connect with her. She does this quite often but I can't name an exact time.","Dr. [Removed] called someone up to participate in one of the demos, He asked the girl what grade she was in, and past experiences with labs and experiments and what went well. He asked why she volunteered and was happy that she was wanting to participate in the class.","He asked where the majority of the class was from and displayed our majors on the board to show which majors were highly represented and which were not represented.","Loveridge assigned us a notecard activity at the very beginning of the semester in which we wrote a little bit about ourselves.","First week of class he asked about our past experiences in physics. He also asked what our general interests are.","We have had multiple introduction activities that asked about our personal background and experiences. A couple times happened in class and we submitted our response ; one activity we are supposed to deliver a get to know me activity to him during office hours.","In discussion periods, our professor is open to hearing your story regardless of whether or not it strictly has to do with course content.","During the first class Dr. [Removed] allowed us to connect with peers via icebreakers. We were then able to share with everyone if we pleased.","I'm pretty sure our first day of class our instructor told us to write on a note card some of our values and things we are interested in.","At the beginning of the course, for extra credit, we were allowed to write a note to the professor saying our background and interests in the class.","This happened at the beginning of the course. We were asked to submit a notecard talking about who we were. We also had an assignment worth participation points where we submitted what values we had.","I can't remember but she has","One of the assignments was an \" about me \" assignment and allowed to give info about the student's background or past.","I can't remember an exact time, but I feel as though she does ask about our experiences. She is invested in our lives and wants to know what is going on in the best way - whether we have exams or other labs.","The instructor had incorporated a \" fast friends \" activity during two of our lectures where we asked our peers various questions in order to get to known them better. From these questions, we were able to learn about our peers and their background / past experiences.","There was an activity that helped us get to know our peers better, many questions to know more about a person's past and why they are who they are.","She asked me how my [Removed] volleyball match went","The professor always has segments before class where she leaves it open to discussion. During these sessions she welcomes students to talk about themselves.","She created an in - class fast friends exercise and encouraged participation and attendance by offering extra credit.","During lecture, sometimes Dr. [Removed] will ask questions like \" Who has driven a car \" or \" who can gone on a [Removed] of [Removed] \" and people will raise their hands to show that they had done said thing before. He does not need to do this but I appreciate that he wants to learn about who has encountered certain experiences before.","At the beginning of the term, Dr. [Removed] asked us some information about ourselves, our motivations for taking the course, and what we were hoping to gain from the class. The questions ranged from where we were from to what we believe we may struggle on in the course.","It was the first day of class. Through a squarecap question, students were asked where we were from.","He asked us about [Removed] and inclines which we have seen in life as it relates to physics concepts.","My professor aims to let us explore our interests and this happened last week as we wrote down the most important things to us currently during our college life.","She asks about our life's and likes to make the class a personal experience","The instructor wanted to know what type of experience we had and how that could be used in the future. I don't remember when it happened nor do I remember when the instructor mentioned it.","Professor [Removed] often asks students if they did anything fun during the weekend or what they plan to do the following weekend, always before the class's start time.","The professor starts each class by asking students if they had any interesting or exciting experiences over the weekend.","Everyday before my professor begins her lecture, she asks all of us what is something fun that we did in the past week. It won't even need to be something that we ourselves find interesting but just something that we would like to share with her.","Our instructor asked us to write a brief paragraph that explained why or why not we were in interested in physics and what physics courses we may have taken, along with what our potential difficulties may be with the class. This occurred at the beginning of the semester, at the beginning of a class.","This occured during the first week. She just did a little get to know you kind of thing.","Since physics courses involve a longer lecture period, the instructor will pause lecture in the middle in order to give students a brief break. During this time, she will often talk to the class, asking questions about students' lives and goals, which has helped make her more approachable for students.","The instructor asked us to share how our experiences were when we did school before and our study habits. This happened in the beginning of the semester.","During our ice breakers, [Removed] would also ask open - ended questions. For instance, if he asked you what your favorite subject, he'll also request that you elaborate more on why."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

This could include personal values or what we are currently doing outside of class time.","n / a \n","The instructor has asked us this before. It was last month.","She connected lecture material to pre med students. She also lets us talk to each other about stuff","N / A","She asks us about our goals for this class","I have not experienced this exact question yet. N / A","On the first day of class ( it was a Monday ), I remember Dr. [Removed] presenting herself and the syllabus of the class. About 30 minutes in, she asked us to turn to our neighbors and talk to them for a couple of minutes about our talents, goals, values, etc --- pretty much just introducing ourselves.","Dr. [Removed], gave us time before class to discuss with a partner on our goals. She gives us time to actually debrief, and share what is important to us with others, before starting another long week of classes.","I don't believe my instructor asked us that.","I feel that the professor deeply cares about us ; she wants us to succeed and that is evident with the amount of resources she gives us to ensure we can be successful. The professor wants us to think about what we want to get out of this class and then advises us to channel that into meeting our goals.","I can not recall when this happened","There was one activity where the instructor told us to talk about our weekend with our peers. This happened in class.","At the beginning of the course we had moments where we had to share with people next to us what we hoped to get out of the class and our future goals. This was the first week of the course.","This was similar to the task where we got to learn about each other as we were prompted to recall something we are good at and share with our peers.","I vaguely remember reflecting on our personal goals and values during the first week of class, tying them to our reasons for studying chemistry. Dr. [Removed] said, “ Think about how mastering this subject aligns with your long - term goals, whether in health, engineering, or another field. ”","some days before class began, Dr. [Removed] would ask everyone how their weekend went or something personal. She would tell us to tell these stories to someone sitting next to us. This would last around 5 minutes and would allow students to think about something other than school before class began.","she wanted us to succeed and tells us what we need to do in order to","On the first day of school, Mrs. [Removed] made us turn to a neighbor and talk about our goals for college or just in life. That was the only time that we talked about this subject.","To correlate what we were learning in that module, she would correlate real - life examples to connect to the topic we were learning.","Allows students to speak in class.","During the first week of school the professor asked us to turn to the person next to us and share a skill that we believe we are good at. She said this was to help us get to know our peers and be able to reflect on our personal lives.","On the first week of class, she had class time set aside for us to discuss our summer / weekend with our neighbor and talk about our goals for this class.","In [Removed] questions she would have us reflect on and answer these exact questions.","asked us to discuss what happened over the week / weekend and what good happened","At the beginning of the semester, Professor [Removed] asked all the students to share interesting facts about themselves and their goals for the course. We were asked to speak to other students in TAS and share our goals with others around us.","The instructor tries to have us thinking of moments that would reflect/ connect to what we are learning. It helps students try to understand the content more","I DONT REMEMBER A TIME","During class once she said very insightful things about career and a future. At the beginning of school she highlightd its all going to be ok. In fact, throughout the year, she talks about how its all going to be ok and how we will do great on the exams.","She would ask us how our weekend was. We would get a few minutes at the beginning of class to discuss. We would discuss with peers surrounding us.","I don't remember it happening.","gives us a break at the beginning of class to reflect","Asked us to share with our partners about what we want to get out of the course, and help us get to know the people around us","I feel like Dr. [Removed] has mentioned this only in the beginning of the course but other than that she has primarily focused on the subject of chemistry. However, Dr. [Removed] does ask us how we are doing every class day at the beginning of class.","She asks us to constantly check the question types and have a goal for our next exam.","Dr. [Removed] asked us to talk to the people around us and get to know each other. This could encompass reflecting on important personal values, goals, or relationships.","This has not occured.","She has mentioned several times about helpful advice and goals in the future","Through instapoll Dr [Removed] would include questions asking us about our goals. Usually we turn and talk to our neighbors to discuss these questions as well.","I think when we first started class she made us talk to the people around us and made them tell about our life stories. Then told us to relate with them.","On the first day of class my instructor asked us to turn to a person beside us and share what is important to us, what we are good at, and to share what we look forward to in the semester. After this happened I remember her telling the class that she hoped we learned something new about someone.","Instapoll questions asking us to reflect on our goals at the beginning of class. Allowing us to talk to one another about certain material","In Monday's lecture, Dr. [Removed] asks us to talk to the people near us about our interests or what we did over the weekend. If we don't have anything to share, she asks that we elaborate on something positive that has occured.","During the first few weeks of class we were given the opportunity to speak with our peers about one another. It was nice to share with strangers this information that I'm not used to sharing.","She mentioned some new research that had recently been done and how exciting it was for us to be the new generation of scientists. It was motivating for the day.","I remember she asked on the first week to introduce ourselves and what is something that we had to keep practicing. I think she is a great person, just not a good professor.","My instructor never directly brought this up during the discussion. However, she often says to think about the bigger picture when going through difficult times. She indirectly leads us to think about our personal goals as motivation.","Maybe at the beginning of the course when she introduced herself.","We talk in groups discussing our weekend briefly before class starts to sort of get out jitters, make forming connections with [Removed] smooth, etc.","Our instructor allows us to turn and talk with our peers. Points of discussion that she often asks us to ask each other is what we did over the weekend or what strategies we want to improve on in a test.","I really enjoyed her trying to do some application problems. I enjoyed the exploding pumpkins demonstration.","idk when this happened","This course carries the ethics flag which requires students to complete various ethics assignments associated with the content of the course. This allows students to freely express their thoughts and values on certain topics related to ethics.","They did encourage us to think about careers in the sciences outside of medicine, which was nice.","I think [Removed] mentioned how we should think about how we could use the skills we learned in this biology lab course for future internships and jobs later on. She probably emphasized on how important it is to understand the purpose of each lab procedure and to try to remember the steps of the procedures.","[Removed] is so so kind and seems genuinely interested in our well being and success in this class. She is unlike any lab TA I have ever had before and I am so grateful. She is invested in getting to know us and with that comes her asking how we are doing in her Class but also others and gives us advice when she has some that is applicable.","Was talking about group projects and coordinating accordingly which I felt was an example of reflecting on personal values and goals.","I have definitely had a conversation with my TA about life in general and my goals. I find it very easy to talk to her about my future career goals.","She said it was important for us to share our personal experience and make sure to reflect on them in order to grow as a person.","We just talk about things whenever have time during lab sometimes. For example, we were talking about how we hope to do well in [Removed] and other personal goals.","Though not about our specific lives, we are always asked to reflect on our research and often have conversations surrounding the impact of [Removed], which in my opinion is better than talking about our personal lives in relation to the course. However, she is a very friendly TA and that isn't to say she doesn't ask questions because she does!","She talked about the overall impact that our research will have on the rest of the world.","My instructor talks to every table group alot and knows every one of our names mostly. The instructor also makes conversation with us if we have time about where we are from and what our goals are.","We are asked to see how biology affects the real world","The instructor said this at the beginning of the course, but I do not remember the details of what exactly happened.","[Removed] asked about what we want to do with our major","I think we sometimes do this in the perusall assignments where we sometimes include some of our personal experiences in our responses","Love this class and the opportunities it has brought me. Everyone is so welcoming and wants to learn from one another.","Dr. [Removed] continuously encourages us to take breaks and get enough rest","At the end of the unit we wrote a reflection on how we're feeling about college.","At the beginning of the year, Professor [Removed] asked us to talk to one another in our small groups and gave us an opportunity to introduce ourselves and present why we were in the course. She always makes sure we understand that she is there for us, saying that \" we all are following different paths that intertwine once in a while. \"","The teacher taught us about having a growth mindset and encouraged us to apply this growth mindset to other avenues in our lives. She is also very open to talking to us outside of class content which I admire about her.","This happened once in the course and it was last week. The instructor told us that this activity which focuses on important personal values or goals was an exit ticket and she wanted to learn more about us.","Dr. [Removed] gave us a chance in class to write a page long reflection of our values recently and explain how they shape us as a person. This is the second time and she always reads all of them.","Every month or so Dr. [Removed] asks everyone to do a reflection sheet. This happened most recently on 11/1 where Dr. [Removed] made everybody complete an Exit Ticket regarding personal values and how it impacts learning, in relation to [Removed] or not. Dr. [Removed] was excited to read all the answers and used it as a time to get to know student struggles better.","The instructor often enforces the idea of having a growth mindset and encourages us to continue practicing in order to achieve the outcomes in this class that we want. This usually occurs at the beginning / end of class or through announcements on canvas.","There have been multiple instances throughout the course where my instructor has done this. We will have exit tickets in which we write about our personal goals for who we want to become in the future. We also often talk in groups about our personal and professional goals at the beginning of class, during which my instructor will often allow us to share our examples with the class.","This was actually very recent, where she made us write - as an exit ticket - about our interest and goals, and how we will use something like [Removed] to springboard ourselves to our goals.","I remember as an exit ticket, she had us write about the content and how it affected our personal lives, dreams, and goals. It was really refreshing to remind ourselves of the purpose of taking a class like this and what we were putting in all the work for.","Dr. [Removed] has us write our motivations for the future. Specifically, what are our core values that we want to bring into the world","The teacher views us like people with lives and interests not only students who should be studying.","She had us do an exit ticket where we reflected on what we wanted in our future. It was about what our values were and where we were headed.","Just last week, we completed an exit ticket that asked us to reflect on the kind of person we want to be in the fututre.","Towards the end of lecture on one of the days, Dr. [Removed] gave each student a handout that asked students reflect on not only how they were feeling about the class, but also how they felt about the college experience. This meant to reflect on whether college and this class were benefiting them and pushing them towards their goals and ideal selves. Students were given 10 minutes to fill this out and return it anonymously to Dr. [Removed].","She did this during icebreakers. We first did them in groups, then we could share with the class.","Last week, we were given an \" Exit Ticket \" which was a sheet of paper that we were encouraged to write down our current journey in college and think about and write down goals we had for our futures. It was required, but it was strongly encouraged and I think everyone in class did it.","Dr. [Removed] handed out a sheet and asked everyone to write a few sentences about why they were taking this course and what they hoped to achieve in their life. She let us know that the responses were anonymous and she would read through them after on her own time. I really appreciated that she would take out the time to care about her students and invite us to reflect on our own goals ; I think this might be the first time I've taken a course and felt like my instructor genuinely cared about me, my learning, and my well - being.","The instructor gave us an assignment to reflect on our professional and personal goals for the future.","Dr. [Removed] always reaches out to us and encourages us through her emails at least once a week with ways to live life outside of school, going outside, taking deep breathes etc.","She is very intentional with our interactions and for our exit ticket, she asked once how the course was going and asked about our career goals and how genetics would help with that.","The instructor had an exit ticket where we stated our goals and impacts we'd like to make outside of classes and in the future.","She gives us “ exit tickets ” after exams where we reflect on our values and identity.","This is what we did for one of our exit tickets two Fridays ago. We wrote it during class and considered motivating factors of our lives that impact our growth and learning.","She asked us to complete an exit ticket, which reflects on our lives outside of the classroom.","Prof. [Removed] has us do these exit tickets every month or so which has us reflective on something that pertains to us outside of class. She informed us of this and there was no pressure behind them.","Dr. [Removed] is very focused on putting the needs of students first and knows how and when to push her students. She is extremely encouraging and always reminding us to take breaks and take care of our mental being especially before tests.","Last Friday we had an exit ticket which listed many values and asked us to circle 2 or three and explain what they mean to you and why they are significant. The instructor said that she reads all of them and is happy to learn our answers and she also said they are anonymous.","We reflect on goals in our discussion questions or during our class \" exit ticket. \"","She asked us to write a reflective paper for extra credit.","Dr. [Removed] helped us reflect on our mistakes after the first test, and he reminds us that our mistakes should not define us. He includes reflection about how to best study and learn for his class before tests, and he also encouraged us that everyone can learn well at the beginning of the course.","One time the professor asked us to reflect on our goals for the course and how we can achieve them.","He had us write about this stuff in our reflections and how they may affect how we perform in this class","The instructor addressed our last reflection. More specifically, he talked about important values to have in this class if you want to succeed. \n","We have semi - regular \" reflection \" assignments in which we answer questions about our outlook on the course, our goals for the semester, and what we're doing to achieve said goals.","The professor assigned us to reflect on a growth mindset based on what we can / cannot control and how we can use this to improve in physics.","In the course, the instructor discussed the concept of a growth mindset in relation to our grades, emphasizing that learning is a continuous process. This happened during a class review of our midterm results, where the instructor reminded us, \" Grades reflect where you are now, not where you'll end up. Focus on progress, not perfection. \" He encouraged us to see challenges and mistakes as opportunities for growth rather than as setbacks. This mindset shift was meant to reduce anxiety and promote resilience in learning.","He made us reflect on how much of our learning was in our control. This made us reflect on our lives, values, goals of learning, and even relationships. This happened before our first exam. He just wanted us to be honest.","The professor had us do a reflection based on our performance on the last exam and how we feel in regards to our success in the class. During class, he asked students to share their opinions on personal growth and encouraged us to keep trying.","A lot of the time, our instructor relates our physics concepts to something that we deal with in our day to day lives. He usually asks us to share with our neighbor and this relates to reflecting on important values that we have in our lives.","He makes us write goals about what we want to achieve for the exams.","He typically mentions during Monday lectures about having a growth mindset and to continue improving. This Monday he mentioned how we should continue to ask questions as it was important when trying to solve problems and it is a good skill to have for us since a majority of the students in his class are planning to work in healthcare.","In class the professor asked us to reflect on an issue we want to solve","The professor asked us to share with a partner what we want to achieve in life. He then asked for volunteers to share with the class.","When the class average was lower than he wanted, Dr. [Removed] encouraged students to reflect on a problem that they wanted to solve. He wanted us to think about this goal and how we would solve it.","One reflection we completed was to think about mistakes we make in life and determine those that can be categorized as in our control or out of our control. The professor then took some examples from the class to confirm what the majority thought. He made us realize that our attitude and effort are some of the only things we can control in this class so if we attempt to put our best foot forward, we may have a chance of landing on the moon!","We have reflections due every few weeks and they seem to be trending towards this kind of idea.","He had us do an activity where we reflect on a student and what internal and external factors impact their performance in the class.","Dr [Removed] has made it a running theme to reflect on our values. IN the beginning of the course he would stress the importance of a growth mindset and let us have a discussion about it in the beginning of class. He also promoted a discussion and reflections which were centered around not internalizing failures. Mistakes are things we make not who we are.","There are “ reflection ” assignments he gives us which allows us to think about the factors necessary to succeed in this class as well as potential limitations a student could experience to result in an unsatisfactory performance.","I can't remember the specifics but he summarized a reflection that the students had done and asked us to think on how we go go about our lives differently.","He asks us how much of our success is based on our own actions. He also made us reflect on this question and see what is in and out of our control.","I don't remember exactly when the professor asked me specifically on my personal values or goals but I would say it is in the format of the reflections we have to do. He will ask if he feels like there are any factors that would interfere with a students learning abilities.","After our second midterm went horribly, Dr. [Removed] asked us to reflect on a problem we would like to solve in the world. Students had the opportunity to share. I believe the intention of this open conversation was to understand that some problems, like our exam questions, are too difficult to solve but we need a growth mindset to continue working at it.","Not too sure","We take time at least once a month to do class reflections about our values, how to stay optimistic, and ways that we can be successful in class.","The instructor always pushes us to have goals and to achieve those goals, no matter how hard it is.","Our professor relates a lot of what we learn back to the point that most of us are studying something in the [Removed] [Removed] field, so we must reflect on important personal values and goals.","Dr. [Removed] often talks to us about how our personal values can contribute to the goals we have for ourselves in this course.","Dr. [Removed] directly asked the class what our goals in life were and had some of us share.","During a mid - semester session, the instructor led a reflective exercise where we were asked to journal about our personal values and how they intersect with our academic goals. Before we began, the instructor explained, \" Take this time to think deeply about what matters most to you ; this reflection will help guide your future decisions. \"","Sorry I'm not one hundred percent sure what he said because i forgot. But i do remember him bringing up some stuff","The professor told us to think about the value of really being interested in and actually learning about biology, and not just being in class for the purpose of a grade. He asked us to consider how valuable education is.","Sometimes his real - world examples relate to this.","I just refelct on my diet sometimes because we talk about energy and stuff like that.","as we learn about molecules that are in food, Dr. [Removed] tells us to be mindful of what's in the food we're eating","Last month, Dr. [Removed] was talking about study habits during a lecture. He said we should value being knowledgeable, and make sure that the information we learn is long term, not just short term.","He always tells us ways to improve our health and well - being. I appreciate it when he tells us stories about his life to help us relate to him.","We did this in the very beginning of our class where we were asked to introduce ourselves. We were able to learn about our fellow students goals and background through the questions we needed to answer in our intro video.","The first day of class she asked us what we want to do with our lives.","I don't know if we did it to such an extent but at the beginning of the course during the first or second week the professor asked us to think about our goals for the course what we have to do in order to best accomplish it.","I was thinking about our introduction video in which we recorded a short video about ourselves that was reviewed by 10 of our classmates so we could get to know each other. We all said something exciting we did over the summer.","I think I remember her asking us to apply the statistics we are learning about to our own lives which would be us reflecting on our own personal values, etc.","That is what the labs and in class activities are for : for us to discover ourselves and which aspects of data science we are interested in.","medical school entry nd pathway","its   just a normal class. I just go in and study","Professor take initiative to learn about each students goals and identify ways to best   help them to achieve it in class.","We have an assignment to introduce ourselves at the beginning of the semester.","I remember professor [Removed] asking a bit about our backgrounds in the beginning of the semester, so that we got to better know each other.","She is always making sure we are heard","Part of our project involves a personal statement and reflection as a \" why \" for the decision to research it.","Some of the statistical survey's we do have these topics imbedded in them making you feel like you can touch on these subjects without feeling bad. Prof [Removed] also has a very sweet and calming approach.","The professor is always very encouraging when it comes to outlooks on the semester. She reminds us often not to feel frustrated with R studio, and reminds us that we are all doing very good.","It was for a survey with a question asking us about our current relationship status.","N / A","In the course, the instructor incorporated reflection exercises during class, such as asking students to write about how the course material related to their personal goals or values. For instance, after discussing the impact of technology on society, they said, \" Take a moment to reflect on how what we've learned today connects to your future career or personal aspirations. \" These activities usually took place at the end of class and encouraged students to think about how the subject matter aligned with their broader life goals, fostering a sense of relevance and purpose.","I know in class we've done surveys about like relationship status, and things like that in the class.","We did that for the begining of year survey","For our project, we are able to choose a topic of our choice. She encouraged us to choose something that was interesting to us or something that has value in our lives.","The instructor frequently asks and talks about goals.","I can't remember a specific time this was explicitly explained / shared.","We once had a discussion activity where we had to read about different careers in the field of ecology, which required us to consider our own career goals.","This has somewhat happened, not directly. She has prioritized mental health actively throughout the semester.","She would do group check up on the class and provide resources that can help in the next exam such as \" This week's muddiest topics \". It would usually be every week we would get this.","This was done during our first lecture of the semester. We participated in an activity where we filled out a mini survey and was redistributed across the class to make sure no one had their own paper. Questions revolved around personal skills and values","Whenever Dr. [Removed] starts to delve into how aspects of ecology are affected from climate change, I believe is also a time to reflect on what we can do in the world and the value on our everyday habits have on the world.","She has instapolls in beginning and ask us our mood. Even ask about our tests beforehand.","My instructor would reserve a small amount of time, in the beginning, to talk about her upbringing and shortcomings in her life. She'd then go on to ask us to reflect and do daily check - ins of what's happening in our lives.","The professor typically begins the class with a reflection question. These questions often ask about how we are doing in our personal lives.","She tells people to feel their emotions and to not let them bottle up and consume them","She encourages us to believe in ourselves and work through our doubts","not sure","yes she ask how we do In square cap","Our professor encourages us to grow our confidence and goals with physics","In office hours she was so sweet and encouraged us to talk about ourselves, and we bonded over the fact that me and my friend are learning [Removed].","In our attendance question, she sometimes asks questions about our goals for this course.","Dr. [Removed] would tell us stories about her journey in the physics world and her experiences dealing with the struggles she faced to get where she is today. She would support us and let us know not to let anyone make us feel like we are lesser than we are or that we do not belong somewhere.","Allows us to share out in the beginning of class as a way to check in with us.","Just asks every class what our goals are.","He has talked multiple times about finding what you want to do in life and figuring out what path you want to take.","There was one lecture my professor could not be at so he made it an online lecture and part of the lecture focused on things we value and how our values shaped us. We had to pick 2 values we felt aligned with us the most and write why we aligned with them.","He gave us a squarecap question at the beginning of the semester and it had three different options with things we personally value and or seek. And he gave   us time to reflect and talk about","In an online make - up lecture from when Dr. [Removed] couldn't teach a class in person, we did a mindfulness activity. We selected the top three values in our life to us, decided why they were important to us, and ranked their importance in how they govern our lives.","The first class, he introduced the course and then presented the first assignment which was to write a notecard dealing our goals and what we hope to learn from the class. Then, we turned in the assignment so that he could read what he wrote and learn about our goals and personal lives.","During one of the first few lectures, Professor [Removed] showed us the quote : “ Three bricklayers are asked : “ What are you doing? ” The first says, “ I am laying bricks. ” The second says, “ I am building a church. ” And the third says, “ I am building the house of God. ” He then asked us which of them we believed to be doing their best work, allowing the class to reflect on the values that will motivate them in both college and their personal lives.","I m unsure if he did this.","The instructor asked about our reasoning on taking the course. Before Every lecture we have a square cap session. During one of these sessions our professor asked about our goals and beliefs about which brick layer in a story is most similar to us. This was during the beginning of the course.","He gave us notes cards to fill out about ourselves, and actually read them","This was part of a partiular discussion we had near the beginning of the year, as well as the notecard extra credit. I believe we also had an assignment discussing interests and goals.","He did this at the beginning of the semester. I think it was pre - lecuture so that he could get to know his students better.","Our professor does squarecaps asking riddles of some sort, prompting the values of the class.","Fill a form with personal questions","In one of our course modules the instructor asked us to consider our own personal motivations and background, both so that we could consider why we were taking the course and so that he could learn more about us as people.","There was one lecture where he was not able to come in person, so our lecture activity involved this reflection. This happened near the beginning of the course.","We were asked about our goals for this class. This keeps me motivated.","Dr. [Removed] always reminds us that we are more than our grades especially during office hours. She is an amazing professor to talk to, she has given me so much valuable advice and was helpful in expanding myself.","He always relates to math concepts and ways of effective thinking to real life, and how we can approach all sorts of obstacles in daily life with these values.","She had a fast friends group activity at the beginning of the semester, where we answered some deep questions. In the midst of the semester, there was a second fast friends group activity where again, we shared deep questions with others.","This has not happened that I can remember","She did an amazing job at this. When the course first began we were asked to make a powerpoint slide in which we answered a set of questions that described us including our backgrounds and even fun random facts. I enjoyed this because I felt like I was able to showcase who I was to the instructors and students.","He likes to relate his problems to real - world examples. Students can make this connection to their personal values and goals in their lives.","[Removed] questions about our goals for this course","At the beginning of the semester, Dr. [Removed] asked why we were taking this course and what our expectations were. He revealed that when he took it he did poorly because of several underlying issues. He does not want us to repeat the same mistakes so he encouraged us to seek help.","For an attendance question last week, he asked us what our goal grade on the midterm was. Previously he's asked us to set goals for ourselves for the attendance question.","The instructor gives multiple opportunities for students to set goals on their performance and provides the opportunity for us to reevaluate after. One specific example is before our first midterm, we completed a survey to predict our score on the exam. Following the exam, he showed the statistics from the survey, as well as our actual results, so we could compare our predictions ( or goals ) with the actual results and determine what ( if any ) changes should be made so we could reach our goal for the next exam or major assignment.","It was at the beginning of the course during the course introduction. He sort of implied it by asking us about why we took his class.","I don't really recall any times any of my professors have asked that for me maybe there TA's but I do not have any recollection if any of my professors have done so.","When its exam week, he usually tells us if we are overwhelmed with information, we should go relax or get help form the mental health building.","Everyone class we reflect on our experiences and what helps us best. For example we've talked about what study strategies help us the most.","In this course, the instructor provided us with information on how we can maintain our personal values and goals as well as a way to reflect on if we have the same value and later on in the school year","Today we worked on reflecting on what we value the most in our lives","Again, today she made us fill out a paper asking us to choose 3 of the given values we think are most important and write some sentences on why.","After the first test, Dr. [Removed] explained his personal values and goals that keep him motivated and going, which made me think of my own. This resulted in me realizing my own' [Removed]' and helped me get excited about going to class, learning the material, and crushing the tests.","At the beginning of the year he had us reflect on what we were expecting going into this course and what our thoughts were.","During the first lecture of the semester we had an instapoll where he asked students what their major was and what career path they see themselves going down.","At the beginning of the semester, we answered [Removed] questions with questions about our interest, hobbies, and aspirations are.","At the very beginning of the course, our professor asked us to share some goals we had for this course. We then briefly discussed what we all said, but since then, we haven't spoken about it.","We talk about our lives everyday before class starts. [Removed] asks us how our weekend went outside of college.","We talked about our majors, and backgrounds in physics on the first day of class.","This could have happened   I just do not remember a specific instance of this happening.","The instructor asked that you should sit down and think about your path right now. Ask yourself if this path is really for you and evaluate it from there","In this course there was an exercise where we had an exercise where we all tried to find things in common with one another. Connection with other students is highly encouraged and pushed for.","He asks us to recognize what is important and urgent in our lives to work towards our goals of time management","During a reflective exercise early in the semester, [Removed] asked us to take a few minutes to write about our values and goals, encouraging us to share with a partner afterward. This activity fostered a sense of community and allowed us to learn more about each other's motivations, making the class feel more supportive and connected. \n\n","Since we are organizing our class registration right now, we've all individually gotten a lot of insight on the path we want to take for our degree. I have even heard many students talk about changing their degree, and I think [Removed] 108 is an accessible class period where we are able to ask questions and further our knowledge on this subject. Mr. [Removed] constantly reminds us of the resources available so that we can access them outside of class if we are confused.","This has occurred several times already however among the more notable times was when we were asked to write an ethnographic autobiography."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

She was also very considerate the day following the presidential election and made the class less heavy, which I really appreciated.","I'm pretty sure I remember her talking about the services [Removed] [Removed] provides at the beginning of the course in our first couple class days during syllabus / intro week. I have a poor memory, but I think she talked about reaching out if you're struggling? I'm not sure if she's mentioned it recently, I've missed a lot of classes due to exams","She talks about D&amp;A accommodations to the entire class even though from the initial anonymous paper toss survey there's only one student with D&amp;A accommodations. These accommodations can really help people with disabilities and hopefully make their disability a little less obstructive and help their mental health while in school","No answer","After our first test was released and graded, our instructor invited us to join her in her office if we needed additional support   or wanted to talk about our scores / better plans of action for succeeding in the course.","She talks about the mental hardships that come with being a STEM major. She provides her personal experience, and what she did to overcome this. She also offers support to classmates by encouraging us to ask for help when needed.","The first day of class she mentioned that there is a mental health department and I believe she has information in her syllabus.","The professor would share some instances she struggled with mental health and tell us how she overcame them.","My professor is always encouraging us to feel our emotions, and if we are struggling in any way, to come to her or reach out to someone.","Asks about how we are doing at least once per week in the squarecap questions","Talked about not getting stressed out and recommended [Removed] services.","She talks a lot about the feeling of belonging within this field how even she wasn't a master right when we started taking physics but we all have the ability to grow in our learning","she talked about the importance of inclusivity and how that promotes learning. I think that ties to mental health. She also talked about her own mental health and struggle with understanding if she belonged in physics as a student","Not sure","Dr. [Removed] has spoken about mental health services previously. I can't remember what she said, but she encourages students to take care of themselves and tries to relieve our stress over exams and assignments by providing make up exams and giving us adequate time to complete our homework.","Professor [Removed] is very cognisant of mental health and always encourages students to express how they feel and incorporate all aspects of themselves into their learning","I am pretty sure [Removed] posted a canvas announcement","The professor hasn't explicitly announced the resources we have. Though, he did say it at the beginning of the semester and applied it into syllabus and emphasized it when first reading it.","He showed the section in the syllabus. He also said to be careful on halloween","Professor [Removed] ensures that he sends resources regarding mental health to the students as frequently as he can, especially via email. He also discusses such in class","This is really promoted in this course.","Dr. [Removed] is very encouraging, giving us extra opportunities if we fail in homework and exam.","When midterms were coming around the corner, he told us of resources we can use to study and not stress out too much. He mentioned that the grade on the test does not determine who we are.","He's there all the time for us and I can tell. He wants the best for us to succeed, given with all the resources he has set out for us in his class.","The classes are short so there isn't too much time for personal stories but i think he has talked about the mental health services","In the canvas modules there are numerous resources provided by the professor to prepare us for the class and providing optimal study habits in order to think like an engineer.","It was on an online module we needed to complete in place of an in - person lecture. The professor couldn't hold class one day so he made an online module with material to read and questions to answer. The first half of the module was all questions and reading about personal development and introspection, including about mental health.","I believe she has made us aware of mental health resources on campus","Dr. [Removed] always makes sure that we know that if we need mental help, she always offers her office hours to either go talk to her about class or anything in particular. She always encourages us to try our best and to go talk with her.","Dr. [Removed] keeps encouraging us during lectures.","Like the anonymous calling","The presidential election just passed, and many were disappointed by the outcome. Dr. [Removed] made sure to mention health services and how talking about things may be beneficial.","She lists services we can find to help us and has reached out to check up on us. She also advises in beginning of lectures to take time for ourselves and not burnout.","Constantly tells us that we deserve to be in her class and that physics is a difficult university level course. She told us about mental health services that [Removed] provides to help us","At the beginning of the course, she explains that mental health resources are available to students on her syllabus.","He told about how he was mentally unstable while he was in the college. He told use to get a help if needed or talk to him.","The things I would often think about when the instructor would say this, would be the workload of the class, and of all my combined classes, as it can get stressful dealing with the sheer workload. The instructor would reference the mental health services when going into difficult topics or when referring to upcoming tests or homework due dates. \n","He shared his experiences in college and told us to use our resources if we ever deal with any issues we may be facing. He recommended the health centers the school has and genuinely was concerned for our wellbeing.","He encourages us to take advantage of campus resources. This includes the mental health center and [Removed]","He described a time where he failed physics the first time while battling undiagnosed depression. He then told us that there are plenty of resources on campus if we feel similarly during the semester.","Mentioned seeking out support if finding difficulty in the course and course load in general. Promoted getting good sleep and our wellbeing.","During the first week of classes, after going through the syllabus, he talked about the resources for mental health and shared his experience with mental health.","They just said if you are overwhelmed, speak to someone and utilize resources. It was in response to Dr. [Removed] referencing his own history.","My instructor told us about [Removed] outpost.","I feel like this course in general emphasizes mental health so this happens pretty often.","Dr. [Removed] states to always stay calm and collected. He promotes that you need to always believe in yourself for better health.","The instructor gave a lot resources even herself offer student if they needed help about their mental health. Which is very awesome","It was during the second or third week of class when the instructor mentioned not to overwork ourselves and put sleep above studying. She also gave us an activity on how we prioritize our physical and mental health.","This happened within the first weeks of class where she told us about the multiple resources that were made available to us the [Removed], [Removed], and general resources.","We have talked about the various resources available to us when discussing mental health.","We had a slide show that talked about the resources on campus and a slide was dedicated to mental health resources. This happened about two or three weeks ago.","Our professor talk about how college is stressful and he is willing to help for his class just go up to him after class and ask him.","[Removed] went over slides encouraging support system during class. She wanted us to go and visit if we needed it.","My instructor had a whole class dedicated to our mental health. She provided us with the resources available to us but also gave us tips on how to work on our mental health.","We are offered many ways to talk to someone about how we feel on campus.","He keeps an open door in general. He also is very forgiving when students are in need.","The instructor includes a section about mental health services on the syllabus. There, he lists resources.","Professor has discussed avaliability of on - campus resources","The instructor referenced on campus mental health resources during class and encouraged students to use these resources as the semester becomes more difficult and we may feel overwhelmed, etc.","I remembered Dr. [Removed] talked about mental health service in the beginning of one of her lectures, but I couldn't recall the details","In the last lecture I attended, Dr. [Removed] specifically mentioned and recommended the [Removed] for students with mental health maladies. She entreated us not to suppress our mental health issues and bottle them up like she did when she was an undergraduate, which I think is really valuable advice.","Professor [Removed] encourages each student to come to office hours to discuss whatever we may desire. She is always happy to help and I believed would provide mental health services if a student needed it.","She made it clear that she understands this is not our major and health is important.","At the beginning of the course when explaining the class and resources, she acknowledged that many of us are undergrads in our first few semesters at [Removed]. She told us about mental and physical health resources on campus, and might have put it in the syllabus ( I'm not a million percent sure about that one ).","She has included some of those resources on the syllabus and some class slides","Maybe not resources, but at the beginning of the semester she explained to us that the reason she has our homework due at 11:00 is to deter us from pulling all - nighters and prioritizing school over our personal health.","[Removed] would use icebreakers to find more about the student class and connect with them on a personal level rather as an instructor. For instance, he would ask some students to share something about their past experiences with the rest of the class.","[Removed] has provided resources through our online [Removed] course and during seminars. This has been very helpful and informative.","Dr. [Removed] provides us with comfort and the freedom to talk to him whenever there is anything conflicting with a student's success and well - being. Along with that, in every class, he shares a slideshow with campus resources.","Talked about useful resources we could use when feeling overwhelmed like the tip staff and [Removed] mental health counselors.","Sometime in the first two weeks of school, the instructor talked about the importance of having time for yourself and talking proper care of your needs when life got busy. The instructor promoted the use of mental health tools such as carving out time in the day or “ time blocking ” to do specific tasks or necessary activities that needed to be done and to rank them in terms of importance. Then to do only the 3 most urgent and important ones and then take a break or do something for ourselves such as go on a walk or prepare and eat lunch. He advices us to use planning techniques such as time blocking and week planning in order to prevent feeling overwhelmed or anxious later in the week.","Our instructor often likes to remind us that we have mental health services at our disposal for any reason at all. He randomly gives us this information and always is willing to personally guide people to reach the mental health services.","Since [Removed] is a class that provides information about the resources in [Removed], my instructor is always providing advice on where to go when you need to talk to someone.","The instructor just provided us with the location and email to receive help from the mental health area on campus. And she told us how we can reach out to them and how mental health is so important."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

But when people nod no, she understand that not a lot of students have gone to a \" good school \".","When they instructed us to look at 3d models.","During our chemistry lecture we learned about many different people who contributed to the ideas we now learn in chemistry. My instructor highlights their importance and how their work built the foundation of what chemistry is today.","Again, I am not sure when my instructor provided any of these. But I am sure she would had provided a good answer.","Very accepting \n","She would talk about the different people who have impacted chemistry and how they have.","i can't recall a moment where she spoke about people with diverse backgrounds and identities.","She does this when explaining the history behind chemistry.","I'm sure this happened, I just can't place when.","Sorry I'm not sure what exactly she said in class that represents the perspectives and contributions of people with diverse background identities. I do know that she's addressed how she can help people struggling in the course and different opportunities that are available.","The instructor talks about how different people use what we learn in different ways.","She talks about all the scientists and the credit.","Typically our class is focused on science based topics which steer away from having to discuss people and individual identities. My professor has never been disrespectful or offensive in this manner though and if she had to focus lecture content on this topic I am confident she would be respectful of all.","When Dr. [Removed] is introducing new theories or topics created by chemists she gives us a little background on who they were and what impact they had on chemistry.","The instructor allows anyone from the class to participate and answer / ask questions. This happened in class.","When discussing famous scientists and how we proved certain chemistry things, she talked about how it was very cool multiple scientists from different time frames came to the same conclusions, and it was cool how theory backed reality. \n","Well, this again goes hand - in - hand with the discoveries of the atom and scientific innovation. The different scientists came from different parts of the world. The instructor did this during unit 1.","I believe that Dr. [Removed] presented opportunities for research that came from a diverse array of students. This was at the beginning of the year. \n","Dr. [Removed] mentions how she understands that we come from different backgrounds and education levels and provides lots of resources to help everyone succeed.","During various times of our lectures, Dr. [Removed] is sure to highlight various ways and methods we may have seen a particular topic during our high school years.","When Dr. [Removed] lectures she does tell us a little about the researchers, and scientists, that the info and formulas derive from.","When explaining the results of the first midterm, she explained how how we used to study and utilize class time may be different from one another. This should be as effective as possible, even if it means changing what we used to do for a more college - friendly method.","This happened shortly after the first midterm. She gave us a quick history lesson on the forefathers and mothers of chemistry. I do not remember the words the instructor used. \n","never mind, I misread the question at first","When we discuss the history of different discoveries in chemistry, she tells who discovered it, but not much about their background.","I am not so sure about the specifics of how Dr. [Removed] represents the perspectives and contributions of people with diverse backgrounds during the lectures but I'm sure if anyone had a problem along those line they would probably have a one on one chat with Dr. [Removed].","Dr. [Removed] likes to provide students with extra readings. Although they are not mandatory, it is useful for students who want to know more in - depth reasoning towards a topic.","the research of many different scientists is presented in class. Not all view points are the same but they are all explained.","The professor brings this information up about scientists, not students, sometimes throughout the beginning of a new topic, of includes them in our modules to gain more background knowledge on the topic.","Dr. [Removed] taught us about the researchers and scientist behind complex scientific equations and took careful time to teach us about the history and backgrounds of these scientists. During unit 1, we learned about several equations writing by scientist such as [Removed], [Removed], and other scientist and how those researchers came to these conclusions. This helped me in understanding the concepts more in knowing their unique backgrounds.","The instructor took notes and offered various points that were helpful.","She explains the contributions to the world by [Removed] - prize winning chemist.   That is the only example of the course that answers the question.","I do not know what this question means or what it is asking. I do not think it matters what kind of background somebody has. Everyone is learning the same material. Everyone fights their own battles if that answers this question.","The professor acknowledges that people have different educational backgrounds and may not have had the opportunity to study chemistry before, so she provides us with extra resources we can use if we need to fill in any gaps. She is not critical of students asking questions that may seem like content that should have been covered in high school.","When sharing brief history in regards to what we are learning, we near about contributions from a variety of people and backgrounds.","The professor does provide information about the history of chem and who discovered what, especially when classes first started at the beginning of unit 1. However, since this is chemistry there is not really much to explain about diverse backgrounds and identities.","Dr. [Removed] goes over many different theories in chemistry and talks about their environments they grew up in and how it affects the reasoning behind their theory.","This is [Removed] class, so there aren't any ethics or representation of different perspectives by diverse backgrounds and identities discussed.","The instructors includes all students into her lectures and provides equal opportunity for everyone","She makes sure that the content is fair and aligned with the other chemistry professors such as Dr. [Removed] and [Removed]. I'd say this happens quite often and she usually mentions it as a reminder when going over quiz and exam preparation content in lecture.","The instructor went   over history and how it has shaped chemistry. Due to unique backgrounds of people it has lead chemistry to being what it is today.","I think our instructor is very mindful of making sure the class content represents the contributions of people with diverse backgrounds such as [Removed] [Removed], [Removed] [Removed], and many more.","I wasn't necessarily thinking that she was, but I feel like she could have. Especially because it's a chemistry course.","She talk about different t theories","they ve talked about how various perspectives and ideas have led to the creation of modern ideas so we get the full picture of how we now have our modern theories","When we are discussing different philosophers that have impacted chemistry and the different backgrounds that they have all come from. This has happened throughout the course when new philosophers are discovered in the material we are covering.","Tbh, it sounds familiar but I could be remembering from a different course, but if it was chem, then it was the first week or so of class.","The professor has made us do assignments that we have to do research for. In this research I learn of contributions of people with diverse backgrounds.","Every week we do a [Removed] assignment where we learn about things and people from different backgrounds.","She explained to us about the [Removed] [Removed] project. Also, how sampling the soil starting in late September would allow us to see if we have any antibiotics that we found.","Told stories about past results within the lab.","At the beginning of the year, we had a survey that asked who the credit would go to if we discovered antibiotic producing bacteria. One of the options was the natives that first inhabited this land and it encouraged me to think more about the contribution of people from diverse backgrounds.","They say past does not matter. They encourage us to work with everyone.","The perusal assignments represented different perspectives and cultural backgrounds.","Would ask the class questions and the way she would respond prompted inclusivity.","We've been shown research projects from different students around the [Removed].","She shows past experiments' results to show us how our experiment can go right or wrong.","During the [Removed] activity discussion board, I would get some insight into background of people and their contributions like [Removed] [Removed]. Providing us with those [Removed] assignments let me to see contributions of people with diverse backgrounds and identities.","She is extremely inclusive of every single person in the lab.","Not really do this","We learned about [Removed] [Removed] who was a Black woman whose cancer cells greatly contributed to research on vaccines and cancer treatments due to their \" immortal \" characteristics.","[Removed] makes this work every lab period","This has never happened","I spoke to [Removed] about her move from New [Removed] and her challenges, as I hope to face similar challenges in the near future as I plan to transfer. She helped me gain insight by answering a very simple question, \" What is what you value most after moving \", she replied with efficiency.","The way the course is set up, it allows students from various backgrounds to work together. The collaboration brings about many perspectives within the group to consider while working on the final project at the end of the semester","The course promotes the [Removed] [Removed] [Removed], which is made of undergraduate students all around the world.","A big part of our research in relation to tiny earth is to encourage diversity within the stem field. This has been made apparent and emphasized plenty of time throughout the semester.","The instructor presented class content that represents the perspectives and contributions of people with diverse backgrounds and identities by acknowledging the various perspectives that are related to the many lab techniques we execute.","Discussing the different geneticists who contributed to the course we are taking.","During our class lectures, Dr. [Removed] would include information about different historical events and people who contributed to what we are learning. Additionally, there's always a linked article for each module that relates what the module is about to the real world.","Since we are taking genetics, we are learning about different diseases and how they are inherited. In this way, it's important to understand certain pedigrees and predispositions for diseases. This comes from a background of different research.","She has always talked about different biological experiments which have led to our current understanding of topics. She has talked about different types of scientists and their personal opinions which has helped give a multifaceted insight into the subject.","Dr. [Removed] had slides that explained the researchers that contributed and conducted various experiments that furthered out understanding of sciences. These people had diverse backgrounds.","She uses a variety of sources and asks many different students their thoughts and opinions","Every class our professor opens with a mini slideshow about something science related and about the people who discovered different things. One time she told us about the different scientists who won the [Removed] prize in chemistry. She makes sure to highlight the people making the discoveries which is cool.","Dr. [Removed] often highlights the history of biological and genetic discoveries. In the course of doing so, she brings up figures like [Removed] [Removed]. However, the focus is mostly on the scientific discoveries and how the experiments were run, rather than how the diverse backgrounds of scientists contributed to their research.","This was during class when we were talking about the discovery of certain theories, facts, and science. She had discussed the famous contributions of scientists and geneticists coming from all sorts of backgrounds.","The main thing I can remember that relates to this is when we went over some of the main scientists that discovered some of the content that is taught in the course. She talked about their background and identities while presenting their contributions and perspectives.","Dr. [Removed] provided different perspectives of different researchers on the topic of gentic theory. She did this as the beginning of the year. She explained how people have different opinions on certain topics, and it is important to consider all perspectives.","When we talk about different genetic variations or conditions, Dr. [Removed] always chooses examples that are representative of different populations throughout the world. She also discusses the scientists behind any discovery or theories she talks about, giving credit to many scientists from different countries or backgrounds.","She includes various examples such as recent discoveries done by people across the globe. She also includes biological examples ( Asian, [Removed] ) which are not just centered around American history.","We talk about various historical figures and their contributions to the field of genetics. These people often have different backgrounds and identities and therefore represent their perspectives and contributions well.","She includes different examples of disorders that can happen to any gender or race. This happned during unit 2.","We look at a diverse range of people in our studies for the class","This happens during class and she presents concepts in a way that are easy to understand even when it is confusing during discussions she tries to break it down in a way were we understand.","This is a pretty hard to bring up in a class like genetics, but I will the class is very welcoming to diversity and not bias restrained.","I think it was around the first few days of class during lecture where Dr. [Removed] basically gave us context as to why genetics is important in real life. She noted how they could be used to alternate gene structures, but also the ethicality of our personal genetic information being stored through different ancestry testing services.","I remember the professor talking about genetics in the news, where she introduced variety of contributions of scientists on genetics. She also addressed some ethical issues. It happened sometime in the beginning of the course.","Dr. [Removed] let us work with others on homework, labs, and [Removed]. Since some people learn slower than the others, she gave us a 24 - hour grace period for those who couldn't turn in their work on time or have other commitments.","I think this was stated at the very beginning of the semester stating that no matter our differences, we as a class can succeed.","I sont specifically remember.","Dr. [Removed] always goes the extra mile to indicate that there are many perspectives to genetics.","n / a","She shows conditions that happen to any race or gender and sometimes gives a backstory on its origination.","Dr. [Removed] always uses examples that are relevant to large groups of people. Additionally, in class she uses examples of genetics in different populations such as gender, ethnicity, etc.","As the class pertains to mostly real world scenarios and their mathematical relations, there is often no acknowledgement of diverse backgrounds which is reasonable.","He brings up the pioneers of physics in class and emphasizes women too \n","Before the last test he had us fill out a reflection where we discussed what students could do to do good in the class, with stuff they are in control of.","He does this very often.","I do not remember the exact context of this situation. However, Dr. [Removed], makes the class feel very inclusive.","At least once a week, the professor would include a video clip or mention the contributions of famous scientists and astronauts that made significant contribution to our society.","Today in class he taught us a new piece of information and asked us if we knew who discovered this information- it was a women, and he asked us why we all assumed it was a man- he made a point to call out our subconscious assumptions, which was enlightening.","I can not recall a specific time.","Assuming I understand what this means ; applying physics content to something everybody can experience or understand. The universal apartment experience, having been in a car or any moving vehicle at some point, moving a box across the floor. This happens at least once a week to demonstrate the concepts.","Our professor speaks about contributions from different people. He makes sure to bring in real world examples of people who have influenced the world of physics.","I m not sure about this one. But he seems respectful of everyone's diversity","[Removed] class while highlighting real - world examples. Provides in - class demonstrations","N / A","In the course Dr. [Removed] explained how physics applies to our diverse careers.","In class","I was not exactly sure what this question meant so I put yes.","N / A \n","I don't remember a specific time","I can't remember the names of the people he mentioned, but I do believe that, during his lecture, he brought up that certain marginalized people weren't credited for their discoveries / contributions to biology. He also did mention and bring up modern examples of the uses of hormones, particularly hormone therapy, but that doesn't really have to do with this question.","In the course, the instructor would mention stories or analogies or people influential to what we are learning. He would describe when it would happen and how their perspective led to scientific discoveries.","The instructor is very kind to everyone.","Dr. [Removed] often folds examples into his lectures to illustrate key points regarding biological processes. A good portion of the time, he uses examples that are culturally inclusive, such as a person who does not eat beef because they practice [Removed], etc. He does this often, but that specific example was from a few weeks into the semester.","This happens whenever he talks about some concept that deals with interesting discoveries. He certainly has a love for his ethnic background in south [Removed] which helps advance the understanding of the course.","This topic is not necessarily talked about as it doesn't relate much to biology","Always talks about different contributions of scientists to biological concepts from the real world.","She did not say anything regarding this, she is just a nice person.","She respects all identities and backgrounds of students, patient in helping everyone.","Since we're helping create a project for the local austin community. It gives us the option of working with topics being of different backgrounds are interested in exploring in.","She went over ethics of data science and share large amounts of data with the public. She showed us that a lot of our personal data could be misused or shown to the public. She told us this as a warning to us to protect our information and help us understand safety precautions as well when using large amounts of data.","We work with a lot of data in the class, a lot of which has to do with many different groups of people","The instructor just made sure that it was easy for people of all backgrounds to follow along with the course. The instructor would give examples of people from different backgrounds have used their data science backgrounds to have a career.","When looking at datasets specifically for our project we looked at different datasets that had people of different diverse backgrounds","There are contribution in her lectures that contains data from sources of many different background.","Happened the first day","I do not deem this class where this is necessary. This class is just coding with data sets within R, this doesn't need to be something important","Since this is a data science class, the discussion typically come about on the different sides or methods on how the specific dataset was taken.","I am pretty sure my instructor has mentioned that datasets that are collected are very individualized based on the method on which they were collected. When collecting data it is important to note that different people have different populations or subsets they might collect from which may change the data.","On a lot of the assignments that we are to complete on our own, there are always ethical questions on certain aspects of data analysis. For example, one of the homework talked about ethical complications with data.","In one lecture, Dr. [Removed] asked our [Removed] to have a presentation about his project.","We used a wide range of real world datasets","The professor herself has come from a diverse background.","Professor [Removed] talks a lot about the bias of data which provides a unique perspective on the data and contributes to our exploratory learning.","Partners with [Removed] of [Removed] on using datasets for project. Also encourages students to be active with resources on and off campus.","can't remember specifically, but maybe provided math / example problems that included people / communities that are under represented","I mistakenly entered the wrong response. Professor [Removed] has not present the class with this topic.","Talks about diverse cases in statistics and researchers in statistics.","In our first lecture, our professor used the example of a graph of different studies about certain foods that caused cancer / early death. The purpose of this example was to show us that just one study is insufficient for research and that there could be more studies showing this certain food is good vs. bad.","Every single example problem, applications of content, and project ideas have been so diverse. Everything we learn applies these ideas.","Not sure","When the instructor is giving us practice problems or practice datasets, they are often about diverse samples of people with diverse backgrounds","With the problems we do everyday in class to learn new equations","Like I mentioned before, there is sometimes that there is an example in class to show what the lecture is about. Some people have experienced it while others have not. However this does not affect the understanding of the material.","My instructor does this by providing sample datasets from various sources about various topics. This happens during almost every class.","She showed examples in slides","She was talking about the different peojects different people have contributed to sensing the atmospheric carbon content in the air.","We've covered much content and have seen examples of papers that were published by individuals with diverse backgrounds","In the past month, our lectures have included historical contributions, so it feels like it automatically checks the box of unique perspectives. Dr. [Removed] does use pictures and studies from herself, her peers, and others who have conducted research in the topic we are studying or just for fun.","N / A","She often shows studies in class and will show the people behind those studies. She represents the findings of those people, and those findings come from people of all types of backgrounds. This happens weekly during lectures","My professor encourages a growth mindset. If we are struggling, there are plenty of opportunities to get help, like office hours and review sessions.","She's brought up a few times her own personal challenges she's experienced as a scientist in a male - dominated field and how it's contributed to who she is today. She is incredibly encouraging of everyone in pursuing their careers, no matter what their background or identity is.","the professor does daily check ins for squarecap to ask how we are feeling","The professor would talk about her struggles in the physics field and relate them to people of different backgrounds to show that it does not matter what your background is. The professor said all that matters is that you do not give up. This had happened about a week or two ago.","I have not witnessed this. I don't deem it necessary for my learning.","Dr. [Removed] acknowledges that most of us are taking the class as a pre - med requirement. She usually mentions medical applications of physics. I would say that she tires to use a medical perspective because most of us have a premed background.","When presenting physics, all of the things learned were discovered by different people. These people come from different backgrounds and have different identities.","He teaches well","The professor presents the concepts of various different scholars throughout time. He explains their contributions and respects their work.","He shows us pictures and does helpful examples","talks about different people and also encourages us to be welcoming","He provides some context to the material we are learning and how it comes from all around the world cause physics is such a broad subject worked on by many people","In lecture, when we learned about new scientific models he gives a little bit of background. This included how it was found, what we used to believe before discovery, etc.","During the labs and going over concept checks.","We discussed an example of 3 different people's motivations for building a wall. I believe this encouraged discussion of people's unique backgrounds and perspectives on how to face a challenge.","The instructor highlighted the diverse backgrounds of influential scientists during a lecture on relativity. When we studied [Removed]'s theory of relativity in the fourth week, the instructor talked about how [Removed], a [Removed] - born physicist of Jewish heritage, had to flee [Removed] [Removed] and continue his work in the [Removed] [Removed]. She said, \" [Removed]'s identity as a German - Jewish immigrant shaped his worldview and his role in advocating for both scientific progress and social justice. \" This added a deeper, more human context to his scientific achievements, emphasizing how personal and cultural histories intersect with groundbreaking discoveries.","This happened on about the second or third week of the course and my instructor talked about how [Removed] came up with a lot of ideas of physics and it's crazy that how the time period he lived in he knew a lot but now average students that have gotten a good education know just as much as him","Professor [Removed] has provided information on the contributions of many different cultures to the realm of physics. Specifically, he has lectured on the [Removed] and the [Removed] and how they were able to calculate the circumference of the [Removed]. Additionally, he has spoken about the contributions of scientists from various cultures, including [Removed], [Removed], and [Removed].","Makes sure to include full historical context and include contributions of people who may have been left out or forgotten for various reasons.","When the instructor talked about the perspectives people used to have on the creation of the world, evolution and evolution patterns based on beliefs or religion.","She explains about how some class materials are presented in different researches. I do not remember the exact date but she sometimes does so by introducing different aspects of one concept.","The instructor has done this by mentioning important figures that discovered or contributed to the discovery of what we're learning. I wouldn't say that they are diverse, but I don't think that's the instructor's fault ; that's just how it is.","My instructor spends the beginning of each lecture going over questions my classmates and I had over he lectures that week. in my discussion session, our TA also goes into deeper understanding over our questions.","Biology 2 is very diverse and so she uses a diverse array of perspectives.","I think her talking about her perspective in the format of her experiencing schooling in [Removed] vs in the us","Dr. [Removed] encourages participation and uses each persons answer as a teaching moment regardless of correctness.","Our instructor has constantly with each thing she presents how it can affect and be understood differently to people with different backgrounds. She presents biology examples that represent so much culture and diversity.","The instructor sometimes mentions physicists who have made significant contrubutions to the field.","not sure","Professor [Removed] presents the course without hiding the contribution of the people behind the material.","Dr. [Removed] is very accepting and welcoming and has talked about different success stories in physics from different backgrounds.","Everyone gets to share their idea in class and gives insight on different backgrounds and culture.","She gave us an activity to write about morals and what is important to us. Which to me is giving all of us the opportunity to elaborate from where we come from and why we feel these ways.","Our class is a mix of people with different view points and backgrounds so she makes sure to include everyone and listen to everyone's opinion.","When making calendars and planning out our schedules, [Removed] used [Removed]'s calendar as an example. [Removed] is in many other clubs and shared how she made her schedule to accommodate her while also allowing us to make our own.","first day of class we talked about how we are all different and going for similar degrees","She presents resources that [Removed] has to offer for many different things. Not everybody might need the same resources so she presents a variety of them depending on what each individual needs.","The instructor is aware of each student. And also knows how to manage a passive conversation with all of them.","Lecture slides contain many people's different experiences","My professor starts each lecture with a photo of something related to that days lecture. These photos are taken by various individuals from around the world who have diverse backgrounds and identities. The professor explains how the image contributes to what we are learning / this field of study.","He explained his personal background and his journey throughout this academic courier.","Dr [Removed] talked about her own struggles, the struggles of people coming from schools without strong physics programs, and the struggles of different minority groups in physics.","We looked at a study done that focused on bacteria but using physics to help towards their answer.","There is so much different content and she explains it in many different ways and examples that helps us understand it.","This is when we are able to discuss various things in class. I can not recall a specific time.","When we were talking about time management, he would ask multiple people about how they like to manage their time so we could compare everyone's answers and how people have different preferences. Then he would also tie in what he did when he was a student, and if the students answer was unclear, he would clarify it with his own words so everyone could understand.","One week, Dr. [Removed] brought in a speaker to share her experience and her expertise with the class about her goals and what her goals for us were. The talk we shared with the woman allowed for us to grow and learn more about her and ourselves.","The instructor asked us about our different background indirectly by asking us to find people around the room with similiar interests or environments growing up. [Removed] we found someone who was similar to us in any way or not, we ended up learning what aspects made us different from each other and the importance of having mutual respect toward everyone despite our differences.","All the time what we mainly talk about are the different points of view from minority male groups such as [Removed] and black young men. In class we've learned that their lack of resources growing up severly influence their career options, which is why we see so many men from those demographics go into the military or prison straight out of high school.","To the greatest extent possible in physics, he'll add a brief blurb about who presented an idea. Then, unsurprisingly for a physics course, the focus shifts to the idea itself.","  The instructor made sure that we understood the different backgrounds people come from. She also wanted us to know that there is a place for everyone here at [Removed]","She makes sure we all feel welcome. She does not hesitate to share information on anyone regardless of background or identity. She does this every day we meet."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

I don't care about the historical context of the people and why this may not reflect a students' background or perspectives, I'm here to learn chemistry for what it is. Not some different version that's \" more acceptable and inclusive. \" We've been over [Removed], [Removed] [Removed], and some other scientists that have made discoveries on the atom. It happened in class, and the professor said how these scientists made big discoveries that added to each others findings and help understand atoms more.","no specific example","She has done this once and it was just to give us the background of the formula we were learning or who came up with the laws we were learning at the time.","When talking about key historical figures in chem, my professor made sure to talk about how their knowledge varies from certain things we do know now. This happened within the first few weeks of the class.","I can not go back and did not mean to rate this question as Yes.","n / a","I can't think of a specific scenario.","The professor described multiple different theories in relation to chemistry and how it contributed to the understanding of the topics as a whole. It gave insight into how there are different interpretations of data and how ideas are developed over time.","At the beginning of the course, the instructor says that she uses a philosophical approach when teaching this course.","It was about a man who had made a formula. That has happened a couple of times","[Removed] incorporates the background behind the theories we learn in chemistry. She gives alot of information of who the person was and what they did.","I was thinking of the first units and the history of the theories of the atom like [Removed] model, but I don't know if that relates","For this course, it is necessary to understand how certain theories in chemistry were developed. Because of this, Professor [Removed] and Professor [Removed] have both described how certain theories evolved and which scientists contributed to them - which, I believe, is acknowledging the historical context of the people and ideas discussed in this course. Unfortunately, I can not remember specific instances.","For every scientist, researcher, formula, idea, concept, etc, Dr. [Removed] always gives a brief explanation of where all ideas were derived from ( whether it be in class or through the [Removed] )","The teacher highlights the important scientific figures and the different contributions they have while also making sure to talk about the historical time period and the work of others that were overshadowed due to their societal status.","Whenever we are looking into the different theories in chemistry and how they had developed, the instructor had mentioned the historical context as to how these scientist came to those conclusion that may not reflect modern knowledge.","  N / A","When we were going over laws and who created them, the instructor briefly touched based on their backgrounds, not necessarily their historical background. So, this couldn't effect students beliefs or perspectives.","We talked about the various scientists who contributed to the findings of laws and how others came to challenge their perspectives with new discoveries.","Honesly i have no idea what htis means","Explained the difference certain individuals within chemistrys past have come up in and how that may affect their viewpoints and those viewpoints may or may not reflect current student viewpoints.","We discussed the history of theories in [Removed] and how they changed over time.","Dr. [Removed] discusses the scientists that contributed to discovering certain topics we discuss in class and this is really helpful because I would have never learned about these people otherwise. She did this last unit, but I can't remember if it has happened recently.","Instructor usually includes the history of a topic through the learning modules","What happened was the lesson electromagnetic waves, it happened in the first 2 weeks of school","When talking about the development of atom models she explained how perspectives can change and how perspectives we now perceive as correct where not accepted at the time.","I can't remember the exact scientist, but Dr. [Removed] did explain the historical context behind figures in science that are not properly credited or may have had theories that were now proven incorrect. She explained to the class that although it has now been disproven, it was the foundation to discovery of a lot of new information, and the impact it had.","It was during the first unit of [Removed] 301, where we went over the foundations of the atom and who contributed what ideas. These scientists all had different reasonings and theories for the makeup of the atom, and we addressed the ones that were most accurate to today","Talked about the people that contributed into making chemistry how it is today like schrodinger, [Removed], rydberg, etc","Part of the content specializes in the view of former scientists, we must understand their point of view in order to acknowledge the full content of the course. Sometimes, these views are incorrect, but it is relevant to understand them as part of the course. \n","This was in regard to some of the theories we had to learn in class. The instructor had given a brief background of who made the theory.","I can't really think of an example at the moment.","She mentions the creators who produced the formulas we are using in class and mentions what the studied and their bckground.","n / a","I don't remember the exact details.","Talked about the history behind chemistry. This was in the beginning of the course.","I think she credited an african american scienctist for an invention or discovery, highlighting it was stolen from that scientist and the credit was given elsewhere. This is a chemistry class, there isn't mch historical teaching.","Not too much history taught in this class.","I can not remember the exact time our professor did this, but when we do discuss origins of theories, for example, she goes over historical context of the people / ideas that came with them.","She has described the talked about the different scientists and contributors to the course material but never really gone into how there background or past wouldn't align with students'.","Mentions the times we took chemistry in high school","In this course, caudill has discussed what she is teaching based on real life examples.","I clicked that answer by accident but no that hasn't happened. It's chemistry its a pretty objective field","The professor only did it once with the history of the atom. Although that was it for educational purposes and dosent reflect individuals backgrounds as most of the scientist discussed where foreign.","The instructor stated that some of the science content may not reflect ones' belief and it is okay.","We learned about different scientists in the first week of class. They did not reflect students' backgrounds or perspectives entirely.","During the beginning of the chemistry class when talking about the absolute basics of chemistry, Dr. [Removed] talked about the historical contexts of how these concepts came along. We talked about the historic of chemistry and who founded the ideas of what molecules and chemistry is. An example of this is when we learned about who [Removed] was during the second week of school.","We talked about scientists like [Removed] [Removed], [Removed], and [Removed]. We also spoke about [Removed]. This happened in Unit [Removed] and was discussed in both lecture and the learning modules.","We went over historical scientists during lecture more towards the beginning of the semester. She didn't necessarily say anything specific mainly just about how all these scientists and differing viewpoints came together to discover and solidify what science we know today.","I was thinking about the scientists and theories that were introduced in the course. Those scientists might not have been able to reflect all students' backgrounds or perspectives, but that is most likely due to the time period and nothing really under our control.","She said knowledge about chem was limited in that time period.","Described historical contributors to science. And their cultural impact","The professor always makes us aware of the scientists behind the theories that we learn in class, and the time period they came from. She always provides a broader background beyond just scraping the surface.","Dr. [Removed] talks about the past of different scientists who have made discoveries in chemistry that we are learning. She talks about what technologies they have and what their social standing was.","During Unit 1, we covered and went over a lot of scientists that were influential and impactful to chemistry and the discovery of atoms and subatomic particles. Dr. [Removed] went into detail and explained how and what each scientist contributed to chemistry.","I chose this answer because I didn't agree with the fact that my professor hadn't but now that I think about it I am unsure she has done this recently.","There is a history of the founders of specific concepts and ideas in chemistry that are acknowledged during lecture. The history was mentioned mostly the first 2 units but there is still some historical aspects being mentioned in more current units. She lectured on the history with slides included.","It isn't any particular instance I was thinking of, but when going over new material Professor [Removed] will talk about the historical figure that discovered what we are going over in class.","I vaguely remember the instructor talking about [Removed] as we were learning about [Removed]'s law, but besides that I can't really remember","Went over historical figures that were significant to chemistry as a whole","I forgot when this happened but Dr. [Removed] talks about the diverse backgrounds of everything in class when it comes up. She also provides videos and the homework that acknowledge these ideas.","We have been given historical context on chemists whose work is applicable to the content in class. It is not necessarily in depth but we have learned about the history of the chemists whose work we are studying. This has happened a couple of times, primarily in the first units.","The instructor never has done this.","I actually read this question wrong, but Dr. [Removed] has always referenced our high school learning journeys in a way that is constructive and motivating. She cares about her students and asks us how our weekends were, she always takes into account the personal well - being of her students. \n","Reviewed it slightly, but not often","I don't think she did","In the learning modules assigned, and sometimes during lectures about certain topics, [Removed] will go into the history of who discovered the concept or what methods they used.","we learned the history of physics and the atom","Typically, I can't remember if it was last week since I was studying for midterms during the lectures, but she will go over historical processes of how a chemistry equation came out. This has happened many times this year.","One memorable experience where the instructor acknowledged the historical context was during a lesson on the development of thermodynamic principles. The instructor explained how early scientific ideas and terminology were influenced by cultural and social contexts from the 18th and 19th centuries, which may not align with modern values or perspectives. Before discussing these topics, the instructor emphasized the importance of understanding the historical foundation of chemistry while also considering how diverse backgrounds enrich current scientific inquiry, making the course feel inclusive and respectful of all perspectives.","During the beginning of this new unit, Dr. [Removed] introduces new ideas and hypothesis from historical figures that contributed to this unit.","It happened in one of the lectures about scientists with wrong theories that's not important to the contexts of our study, however, it showed different perspectives.","The instructor would acknowledge the historical context of the people and ideas by the scientists that discovered theories we've learned in class.","N / a","We used sources in class to learn about antibiotic resistance and the sources came from a variety of people with different backgrounds.","Before lab we are given an explanation of how everything will be ran, what we will explore, and possible things to know when moving colonies from one plate to another. Understanding different point of views when exploring colonies is a huge part of science and finding real discoveries.","Perusall assignments.","We have weekly ethics discussions where everyone can voice their ideas.","The main point of the course is to discover antibiotics in soil bacteria and the context to this research has to do with antimicrobial resistance spreading around the globe. It is seen especially in third world   countries and our research can be a great help.","At the beginning of the coarse he described how this will be helpful to us in the future and all the relative knowledge with the lab material.","He knows that people come from different backgrounds and seems very understanding.","They encouraged us with words like, \" This is your chance to strengthen any areas you're unsure of, and I'm here to help every step of the way, \" creating a supportive and confidence - boosting environment. This happened before major quizzes when they spoke to us.","Has accommodations upon request","In the course, the instructor acknowledged historical context by discussing how past scientific discoveries were influenced by their time's social and cultural norms, which may not align with modern values. For instance, they addressed ethical concerns in historical medical research, particularly involving marginalized groups. This approach encouraged critical thinking and open discussions, helping students understand the evolution of moral standards in science while making the course content more inclusive and socially aware.","The practices we do in lab are explained by [Removed] and told about their significance in history and now.","What happened in this course is that some of the work was due at an earlier time and some of the students would not be able to turn in the work due to reasons we college students can't control like family stuff, work, or other school related. We suggested if the due time can be moved, the professor read the email and emailed the students saying that she understood our reason and will love to help and gladly moved the time for submission. When the professor did this a lot of the students were able to manage their time a little better ad didn't stress as much about the time submission.","[Removed] explained to us what this research meant all over the world. She then mentioned who was the creator of this project and what this project is trying to accomplish. She mentioned the struggles some of us may have but she said that they were there to support us.","I'm slightly confused by this question I don't think I fully understand what it means","Some historical context of the ideas discussed in the course would be the background knowledge of bacterial growth.","Had a question discussing ethics and whether or not we should keep discovery for ourselves and what other communities we should involve when we discover a new significant discovery and science. Should we think we think people should we think the indigenous people of the land we found our items on so we have a lot of perspectives that have been presented to us.","Gave us literature describing the class content's development.","Our instructor is always sure to talk about the background of information that we are discussing. However, it is not the focus of our conversation as we focus more on what we will be doing that day, which translates to the lab as a whole.","My professors have gone over necessary resources. Provided me with multiples sources and other opportunities to expand my knowledge. If I ever have any concerns or problems there is always someone willing to help.","This question isn't super applicable to the lab course, but in our prelabs we learn the contextual science based knowledge that will help us understand out lab for that week and help us be able to complete our research report.","TAs and Prof are epic and cool","Genetics entails history. Dr. [Removed] discusses all about the history of genetics, from [Removed] [Removed] to modern [Removed] - [Removed] gene editing. We always bring up the possible moral issues behind gene editing and the various cultural perceptions of such genetic technology. Dr. [Removed] does not hide any information from us, and she openly talks about the controversies amongst genetics and is very professional and kind about it. For Dr. [Removed], her students are the center of her work! She makes sure that all our perspectives are valued.","My teacher does not specifically talk much about the historical context of genetics. However, we do go through the history of how some concepts were derived.","When we go over a new topic, my instructor usually goes over the context of the topic and the scientists involved in finding out the information we will go over.","We are only one unit into the year, but Dr. [Removed] has shown us articles pertaining to the concepts that we are learning in class and given background on them. When we were learning about [Removed] and his laws, she took a few minutes out of the lecture to give a historical background of him.","She would talk about [Removed] [Removed] who was a monk and the father of genetics. She briefly talked about him and the background of him.","I'm not 100 % sure if I'm interpreting this statement correctly, but in lectures Professor [Removed] always talks about the historical background of certain discoveries relating to genetics, such as the scientists who made them and the experimental process for doing so. Also, Professor [Removed] is very mindful to use the respectful terminology when it comes to talking about gender in class, which I'm sure students who may have different personal experiences with gender identity appreciate.","She describes how science was not always structured and defined this way and how scientists like [Removed] had to operate under very little knowledge and different structures.","The instructor acknowledges the historical contexts of scientists in the [Removed] slides. THis helps us understand more about the topic.","This is during the lectures, as the professor often outlines the history of certain processes and discoveries in biology to explain how knowledge was gained and conclusions were obtained about common beliefs today. One example is the discovery of DNA as heritable genetic material.","Our instructor has acknowledged the historical context of the people and ideas discussed in the course.   One recent example was in our recent lecture, which talked about the molecule of DNA and the contributions of [Removed] [Removed].   After stating her contributions, she talked about why she wasn't able to get a [Removed] prize for her work and other information as well.","Our instructors always acknowledge the \" bumps \" in the progression of scientific research, specifically talking about our history of eugenics and scientific racism.","She talked about the history of genetics and the people who created the concepts","When learning about [Removed] we did a little background research on him and learned that he was very religious and actually failed biology before he became the father of modern genetics. Very interesting since strict religious people often neglect biological findings and the father of genetics himself was a priest.","Dr. [Removed] has talked about the people who have brought ideas of genetics which is nice. For example, she mentioned men and a woman who made discoveries of DNA structure.","She acknowledges the history of certain context of scientific discovery, and makes it important to understand where discoveries originally came and where credit can also be attributed.","She would be very understanding and aware of her audience.","I can't remember an exact moment this occurred, but it is more implied than spoken aloud.","We occasionally go into the history and individuals that discover certain things in genetics. I would say it occurs a couple times in a module but we focus more on content which I'm completely fine with.","She includes history of experiments and sciences knowledge","This is a genetics class, so most of the historical content is the basis of genetics and [Removed].","Instructor presents historical context for certain discoveries in genetics for new topics covered and talks about how they contributed to genetics","Our professor would bring up historical figures like [Removed] [Removed] ; he did this last week when we were discussing acceleration","We always go over how these specific ideas came to and how the historical figure seemed to have come up with them.","A lot of historical or scientific discussions are memorably related to space voyages. Historical references and examples like these usually happen once per class, and he uses them to illustrate how we understand and apply our knowledge of science to the real world.","My professor loves to talk about the moon. So, one situation in which he discussed the historical context of the people and ideas in the course would be whenever he explained the acceleration of gravity using a video from the moon.","I can not honestly remember a specific time off the top of my head.","Dr. [Removed] often uses real life examples in teaching physical concepts. He talks about various astronauts that have faced adversity throughout history during lecture, and likes to remind us how far we have come as a society in terms of space exploration.","[Removed] would show videos demonstrating physics concepts. These videos were mostly about space and the people involved in the moon landing / space related things.","Dr. [Removed] shows us who came up with the theories that we learn in class and also connects a lot of the concepts back to the space / moon which is something he is interested in. I like that he makes those connections and teaches us how we can use what we are learning and apply it to something broader.","Our teacher is very open and understanding.","The instructor likes to connect ideas of force and kinematics with different [Removed] missions that occurred in the twentieth century. This ranges from hitting a golf ball or dropping things onto the moon.","The instructor would reference that certain concepts we were learning were discovered by the physicists before us and how they discoveries allow us to continue to learn and progress science. He also will discuss his favorite physicists and why they mean to so much to his career.","He talks a lot about space and the apollo missions, which is a different perspective to problems.","This is a math class, the class period is short and there isn't really time to talk about historical contexts when you're trying so hard to make sure you understand the math you're learning.","He is sure to mention that everyone is capable regardless of background.","I believe the instructor said something about Indigenous peoples and acknowledging their land in the syllabus. I am not too sure if this was this professor or another in another class, so I am not too certain.","Dr. [Removed] shows many historical tidbits in class that reflect many backgrounds. He adds to this by relating it to physics. He also has us complete reflective assignments that have us discuss and reflect on the backgrounds of our peers that may or may not contribute to their success.","The instructor has explained historical instances of when and how certain concepts and ideas were made and explained how these ideas are often counterintuitive. The instructor has done this various times throughout the course.","He would talk about how people back in the day applied physics in architecture. He also explained its significane for astronomy today and the trips to the moon \n.","N / A","he would talk about how we traveled to the moon and incorporate it with physics","Makes sure everyone feels included!","The professor always tries to tell us about the background information of what he is teaching to help us stay engaged and informed about the topic on a deeper level.","Looks at historical figures and their impact and how they mitigate their own barriers","Dr. [Removed] mentioned various astronauts and physicists hat have contributed to the field. This happened around the 3rd week of school.","He went over the [Removed] and crick model recently and then related this back to our study of [Removed]. He also then explained the creation of the microscope.","N / A","Before we start any square cap questions he answers any comments or discussions during lecture. He also has a a series of comments on certain lifestyles in diet relating to the topic.","The context for the origin of life in this course does not disregard the the religious values of the students","when in Unit 2 of the course the instructor discussed [Removed] and [Removed] experiment. In this section of the lecture he described the though process, hypothesis, experiment, and results that were produced by the scientists and their relevance to the formation of life on earth.","Well biology as a whole just needs history or background knowledge as to why it is the way it is.","During the second unit ( [Removed] [Removed] ), Dr. [Removed] discussed the theory of evolution. While maintaining an unbiased perspective, he shared the facts and science behind this theory.","During a lecture on the history of genetic research, the instructor highlighted the contributions of scientists from diverse backgrounds and acknowledged the cultural and ethical issues associated with some historical experiments.","He provides students with one on one help if you stay after class, [Removed] will make sure that every student who has a question will get their question answered, tihs happens everyday after [Removed].","We briefly had a discussion about evolution given biological evidence of it. I liked this perspective outside of a religious context.","Using applicable ideas and references to authors of books and research, during lecture","Dr. [Removed] always provides real world examples in his teachings, especially as biology expands on very human - specific topics. When we went through the history of how organisms came to life ( from how life formed ), he said it in a way where it did not matter what the students' background were, as we all came from the same \" form of life \".","We spoke about topics such as evolution ( bacteria, multicellular organisms, multicellular organisms ) when speaking about the origins of life, etc, which may not align with individuals of some religions that believe God is who created the human race.","Everyone has different biology background depending on the year they took it, where they took it, and what level of it they took. I m fairly positive this was addressed, and its true since every school has different teachers and teaches differently.","I can't remember the specifics but I believe it involved my instructor discussing evolution. Dr. [Removed] mentioned previous evolution and origin of life theories held by people historically and discussed why these beliefs were previously held and why they are now known to be false.","I don't have a specific example in mind, but he actively gives credit and background to whatever topic is being discussed in [Removed].","He talked about certain areas of research which happened in [Removed]. He mentioned it a couple weeks ago. He talked about certain developments and stuff that he had learned.","Dr. [Removed] goes over important context about [Removed] concepts, experiments, ideas, and other historical information while lecturing.","Yes, she teaches us how to code in R studio which is built on a community of people's functions. She uses them to expand our knowledge of data and the science behind it.","Can't remember","The instructor talks about different codes. Through this she expands on them through examples.","In the beginning of the course, the professor included brief historical context of what we will learn in the class.","The instructor included slides on the history of statistical figures. This included a woman who was attributed to guiding public health measures using early figure drawings to show the impact of disease on the population.","While I can not recall such a moment, especially given that most of the content discussed in the course is about R and not about people or ideas, I marked that she did so since I believe she would have done so if an opportunity was present.","Discuss context of datasets","Last week the instructor acknowledged how presenting data can be misleading and hurt people. This also came up with the homework exercises where students were asked how data could be used in dangerous or misleading ways.","if you have taken another stats course previously this course is honestly super fair and so far the coding is very fun. You usually work with coding every class period but we are walked through every step.","Dr. [Removed] brought up a statistician that made a very impactful visualization. I liked this because I find data communication very important.","The professor mentioned a case where a predictive model tried to predict whether certain individuals would commit a crime / have a reoffense. The model incorrectly predicted more [Removed] [Removed] would commit crime which did not line up with reality, showing how biases can impact models and real people if we are not careful with how we use data and models","She acknowledged everyone's thoughts and was open to all that went on.","During lectures, when going through the worksheet she would explain why some dataset are like that and give us background information regarding it.","The professor would prop the people who contributed to the presented tests. This would happen some times during the lectures. \n","Choosing studies with a diverse number of topics","This has not happened- she has not discussed the history of the content.","In my ecology course, the instructor acknowledged the historical context of ecological theories and practices by highlighting diverse perspectives. For instance, before discussing conservation strategies, they said, “ While many conservation methods have Western origins, it's crucial to recognize and integrate indigenous knowledge and practices. ” This approach, introduced at the start of each major topic, fostered a more inclusive and holistic understanding of ecological concepts.","Talked about different careers people studying ecology can have and the other subjects that contribute to a deeper understanding of ecology.","I am not sure when she has but I do remember in the beginning of the year","She talked about how the whaling industry affected otters populations as well as the incursions of [Removed] leading to the decimation of the beavers.","She brought up a lady called [Removed] and how she discovered that south becomes more extinct and at high altitudes less extinct and more new species","When past figures that have identified the ideas that we use today, we learn about them and how we have contributed to our modern day society.","Some ideas in [Removed], like in many science fields, are only the most current scientifically sound theories we have available. If one were to look at the history of the field of evolution alone, which this course has significant overlap with, one would find wildly varying theories for the tree of life that changed in as much as 100 years to as little as 25.","It was when we were talking about how ecology and evolution are related. This was a recent lecture ( late [Removed] ) She gave context for how [Removed] came up with these ideas, although not in too much depth.","I feel like it was referenced in relation to things like the use of certain words or the history on some experiments and why they are still in use.","She's consistently stated plant bio and other biology careers when she relates content to them.","I think she talked about the story behind a female researcher, but otherwise just a side note","I can not state a specific time, but I know when talking about some concepts / topics in class there has been some historical context said either about the person that helped create ( with ideas ) in the certain topic or where it originated from.","Again I can't remember the exact time, but we've talked about different experiments that were done previously and their different methodology. I can't remember any exact details though I'm sorry","She did this only once when talking about her past in graduate school.","She shared her experience as a woman in physics, which is a male dominated career. She was sharing her self doubts about her physic career.","Physics is pretty general across all locations but the professor has brought attention to how we do things differently in some areas in [Removed].","She always talks about how things started.","The professor always acknowledges student's opinions and ideas even if they are not correct. In addition, she always provides the solutions for each question.","She is always making jokes about the time when she was a permanent resident, which brings awareness to those who have a different nationality.","Our professor has talked about the history of physics and how she wants to inspire us to continue to learn physics as it can be applicable in many aspects of our life and has talked about previous history of physics that we can relate to the future.","She does mention the people who had developed the topic.","My instructor talks about how physics differs in other countries. The ideas across all backgrounds are typically the same however.","The instructor went over the responses of the first survey and tried to implement what the top responses were into her teaching. This happened about a week or two after the first midterm.","This happened in class. She basically talked about what her TAs experienced in their physics courses and how she would use their different backgrounds to make the course better for her current students.","Talked about the physicists behind theories and concepts.","She treats everyone equally and with respect.","I don't remember when it happened last, but in general [Removed] explains physics topics and how they apply to all of us. She also checks in with students to make sure they comprehend the material","In the specific course professor talked about [Removed] and his experience with physics","We were discussing one of the equation where Q = [Removed] and he discussed the person that discovered this who was a genius. He said the person went to their teacher to present their findings, but the teacher told them to sit back down.","When the teacher brings up concepts and theories created by certain physicists, he often includes an anecdote about their lives. For example, when discussing [Removed]' law, he brought up how [Removed] was the first person to solve some mathematical theorem in high school.","Professor [Removed] has always been available to help before and after class.   During class, he makes sure to go at a reasonable pace, always stopping to explain something that is not completely understood.","This isn't really included in this course but I don't think there's time for it because there's so much content to cover.","He just mentioned historical events and how they relate to the physics concepts","Every prelecture we like to understand the ideas and who they came from in history. We understand how these figures in history lived and learned in their day. Last person we studied was [Removed] with his boat experiment on the laws of motion","When introducing concepts, the instructor tends to give the history behind the discovery / impactful applications of the principle to modern physics. This history is focused on physics, not really anything controversial or taboo.","Likes to talk about the background of physics often and relate it to the class","On last Friday's lecture, we took time in class to each talk about our favorite scientist, which came from a great variety of backgrounds as we discussed.","For many pre - lectures, we go over the history of a concept of physics. This usually involves very famous physicians and mathematicians, such as [Removed] and [Removed]. In class, we then discuss the pre - lectures and therefore the discoveries of these people.","There was an application of scientific experiments where Dr. [Removed] would provide historical context. Such as the [Removed] experiment being limited to their technological in that historic time or how the understanding of physics was different in the past compared to today.","I wasn't entirely sure that the instructor ever said this.","They go over the historical aspects of physics, such as discussion how [Removed] did his experiments.","Historical context is discussed throughout, I think Dr. [Removed] makes it a point to keep limited time in lectures focused on learning and digesting the physics more than the origins of said physics. But context is given regularly through the course.","We were talking about same major contributors to the conceptual laws of thermodynamics. We didn't go too much in depth about the history or the people, but they were mentioned and acknowledged.","The professor brought up a parable about a who was building [Removed] [Removed]'s [Removed] in 1671. He brought up three different perspectives on why they were building the cathedral ( taking care of family, maintaining career, worship of God / higher purpose ).","I brought up some historical info about the origins of \" dark stars \" with a debate between two scientists ( maybe [Removed] and [Removed] ) and Professor [Removed] was receptive to that.","I don't remember the details, but in the beginning of the course he asked everyone to write a small introduction of themselves which include the students' background info","Last class we actually had disucssions on our favorite scientists.","She has discusses many different scientists as well as different researchers on campus.","Talks about some important historical figures in biology like [Removed] [Removed]. Also talked about the history and theory of biology that are very old ideas.","Dr. [Removed] has mentioned that the course does talk about evolution and that it may not align with some peoples views and religion.","Talking about evolution","When discussing evolution she made sure to state her understanding of how it may not align with everyone's views and even if we don't believe in it it can still be interesting to know about and to keep an open mind.","I am not sure, but talks a lot about their background and how it relates. As well as talking about other researchers.","We all get the chance to answer","Not really sure.","Many famous physics researchers from history had preconceived ideas of the world that do not reflect modern day values or perspectives.","Goes about the course treating everyone equally","I feel like the background information Dr. [Removed] gives about the course content fits this idea well. The two most prominent examples involve explaining who developed certain physics concepts and how they've evolved over time.","Oops I meant to put no here I think","I can not think a specific moment that would answer this question.","[Removed] tells us background knowledge of the people who creates the theories and definitions behind the materials.","Since this is a physics course, it's very mathematical so there is minimal space to talk about historical context and such. However, our professor has spoken a bit about the different ideas that went into certain theories.","I am not able to recall any specific moment at the moment.","this hasn't really happened because it's a physics course","Dr. [Removed] makes sure to always mention where certain ideas in physics come from, and also mentions the historical circumstance / diverse background of the people.","I don't quite remember, but I do know that [Removed] would also be open to hearing new perspectives.","This week my instructor mentioned how there are times when you would learn history in class and would use the textbook it tells you the facts of what s happened at that point in history and a lot of times they don't mention certain other aspects or perspectives from that point in history. The textbook tends to highlight what they believe should be shared, its biased and this happens a lot with [Removed] [Removed] in history. There stories aren't always presented to the world or taught in a school curriculum. Some people in my class could relate to this by they also come from the   same background but other students might not come from the same background so it's a chance for them to learn something new and maybe reflect on if they can relate to this in their own way","He'll mention ( and I don't know if it specfically counts ) but the people who contributed to the topics we're discussing. Like who was [Removed] when going over [Removed]'s law."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Possibly saying that \" find a way that best works for you \"","She talks about different experiences. This happened about 2 weeks ago.","We were talking about different theories that resulted in our current understanding of atomic theory. Through this, many different ideas were shown.","During the lecture, the Professor discussed how different perspectives in science contribute to new discoveries.   She mentioned something along the lines of, [Removed] is about more than just formulas — it's about how we approach problems differently. Every unique perspective can help us see something new, and that's where breakthroughs happen.","Chemistry combines both knowledge of math and science so when she asked us in the first week to convert units, it combined our knowledge of units from classes such as physics or calculus in order to solve it. She asked to convert nanometers to micrometers","On the first day of class, we shared our strengths and weaknesses with the people around us. We talked about how different we all are, and the instructor brought us all back together and told us that we should utilize everyone's different backgrounds.","Not really necessary when it's more of there is only one right answer","The instructor gave us varying views on specific topics and explained how each could help us learn.","My professor emphasizes at least once a week that learning from each other is important. She usually mentions this when we're preparing for an exam or challenging topic. She says to \" ask questions, help each other out, study together. \"","This occurred during our first Unit when we learned about how there was multiple scientists that would come together to create an equation, it showed that not one person could do it by themselves, even if they are geniuses.","This wasn't really done","When she showed us the different models of an atom throughout history. Each one changed over time because new ideas and perspectives were presented.","N / A","I can't remember what happened in the course when she said it, but she probably said it twice during the semester. She probably said it when we were in the introduction for the course, talking about different contributors to energy discoveries with the hydrogen atom and when she introduced different ways atoms were displayed.","The instructor has taught us that there have been many different people who have had revolutionary ideas which contribute to an understanding of the topic.","I'm not sure when this has happened.","N / a","I can't remember exactly what she said","During one of the lectures about using a formula that is given but she showed us her way of doing the equation that was simpler. This gave us a decision on how we wanted to approach the equation.","I read the sentence wrong and I don't think it has ever been “ clearly ” stated.","When we were discussing contradictions to classical chemistry, she explained why they didn't work and provided evidence of modern chemistry that proved it. This approach allowed for a new perspective that we take on chemistry.","Regtaedghcbnxhteyjrfghjetryxfhj5e","She would make us do assign learning modules a day before lecture. This helped us get an idea of what we are doing in class so she can go through examples with us. She also gives us quizzes or test every Wednesday to do checks and progress assesting.","She gives opportunities to work with other students to come to a conclusion on an answer","Our instructor lectures on units and often does experiments to show real - world examples of what we learned. For example, when learning about gas laws, she did a demo of using pressure to blow up a pumpkin.","After the first exam, Dr. [Removed] states that studying in groups of people who were all taking [Removed] would help for the next exam. She encouraged everyone to form study groups with people who came from different chemistry backgrounds.","professor uses tips / tricks, lectures, online resources, in - class [Removed], etc.","She will explain how a variety of majors can benefit from understanding what she is lecturing about. She does this throughout lecture whenever it is applicable to what we are learning.","My instructor would look at the questions in both a theoretical and quantitative way. She made sure we knew the background as well as how to do the problem resulting in the correct answer.","In this course we are presented with a number of way to understand chemistry. I think the weekly [Removed]'s, lectures, quizzes, and [Removed]'s contribute to providing variety of ways to understand concepts","They just never did that","She mentioned how different fields of science have different views on certain things. For example when we learned the quantum spin of electrons she mentioned how physicist might view the spin aspect differently. Furthermore she mentioned that in biology covalent bonds are in a different range of delta electronegativity than in chemistry.","When we talked about quantum mechanics, Dr. [Removed] went over the different scientists who helped discover these mechanics and who disagreed with the model","She encourages us to look at different sources for info","In our first unit, we learnt about all the theories of classical mechanics that were later disproved as science and chemistry progressed, but it was still interesting to learn about the evolution of modern day science.","We talked about how we learned from different scientists throughout history and how things changed from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics","Ok I didn't know I'd need specifics. There was one time in my first few weeks that she has described different ways to approach a solution and stated either could work depending on the individual.","When we learned about the [Removed] dot structure or anything about unit 2, she gives us an connection to back to unit 1 and lets us gain the knowledge of this observation so we can see it in the future.","When discussing quantum numbers and the different scientists that built upon each other's work, I feel like this qualifies for this question.   Each new scientist had a different perspective ( or technology ) and they were able to build off of each other because of their various backgrounds / perspectives.","The professor would take into account everyones ideas.","This has not happened.","As students, we need to see the course in new perspectives that would help us succeed rather than complaining about the difficulty of the course itself.","She showed us how fire can react with different elements. I think this was a good intro to wavelengths, frequencies, and photons.","For our first midterm exam, she made sure and verbally say that this exam was going to contain the 25 question types but also be surrounding the information of those question types just so we would know what were getting ourselves into","On the first day of class in our first lecture of the semester, Dr. [Removed] presented the class canvas format. In doing so she presented all the different types of available resources for the students. There are different resources for students who have different learning. I interpreted this to show now unique learning styles and types of thought are appreciated and encouraged in this course.","When we talk about certain chemistry theories, we mention new knowledge. This specifically happened when talking about [Removed]'s theory.","Professor [Removed] has promoted research in the past. She has also discussed how the evolution of science is based on new discovery built off of previous scientist's work.","She gives us multiple ways to study for an exam, which helps a lot when studying for exams. She has a lot of exam materials / preparation, which has helped me a lot.","She lets us talk to other students in help of understanding material","When beginning a new module Dr. [Removed] likes to incorporate interactive questions encourages students to discuss with the people near them, in order to see whether we are able to learn a new way of interpreting her lecture. Dr. [Removed] always encourages students that talking can help us practice our contributing skills that we will have to utilize more   in our future careers.","Many students have a different background with chemistry and resources are provided for students if they do not have a strong understanding of the topics needed.","Our teacher told us to study with other people since they might have a better grasp on concepts that we might not understand that well yet. Getting these other perspectives can really increase how much you understand some concepts.","Dr. [Removed] believes peer collaboration is important to have a well rounded idea of the topics being presented.","I'm pretty sure I've heard the professor saying that differing perspectives are helpful in this course and collaborating with others to study or learn such concepts would be helpful in the long run.","The instructor consistently talks about forming study groups with other students and how it can be helpful to understand the course content from different perspectives.","Our professor's content is minimal in the aspect that chemistry is one answer based there are TA's and the professor to help explain content that the majority is struggling on.","discussing the differing view of classical mechanics and modern with regards to atom behavior and how the new perspective brought about new discoveries regarding atoms","She is always saying that you need to know yourself and help yourself because you are the only one who will truly know what works to make you succeed.","There are some topics in chemistry that are difficult to grasp, Dr. [Removed] always encourages to look at resources outside of class in order to reinforce our understanding of these concepts.","Variety of students who all have different perspectives can change many views in topics. It is helpful to understand how other students view things.","While I don't know the exact date, while describing previous theories on classical mechanics, the professor stated that even some of the science we learn now could be subject to change, and that looking at science from multiple perspectives is important.","In a lot of the rules and conditions we are learning have multiple perspectives and point of views on the material. And how there's multiple creators of theories that made them evolve.","She has made sure to stop, pair, think, and share. She makes sure we can talk to each other about our thoughts on the problems and she does this every class period.","N / A","When discussing the duality of light, Dr. [Removed] discussed multiple experiments that were made to find this knowledge. Each experiment each gleaned some information that together came up with this duality of light.","The professor would give us problems each day in class for us to complete, then go over the answers explaining the multitude of ways one could achieve the answer. She had stated that the work so far may be difficult but as you practice more it won't be as hard. You also have to look at the problems in different lights depending on how and what the question is asking.","The course is designed to learn through the learning modules. The instructor goes over the material from the learning modules every lecture. Do the learning modules before coming to class to understand the material that you learn in them.","The instructor gives examples of different equations and findings that happened because of different people. She gives context about when it happened while explaining the given content that shows us that there are different people that think different things that become something greater.","i m not sure i remember","It is a bit difficult to explain. I am not entirely sure if it happened because it is difficult to integrate discussions like that in to a chemistry course and it is not my focus in the class.","This occurred during a lesson on chemical reactions, where the instructor pointed out that some students may have learned the material in earlier grades while others were encountering it for the first time. The instructor said, \" We all come from different educational experiences — some of you might already be familiar with these concepts, while others might be learning them for the first time. \"","The instrcutor would mention usually using the learning modules about what we are learning about and how it pertains who our environment in real life and what we need for future courses.","At the beginning of the course, Dr. [Removed] made it clear that everyone came from different backgrounds and different experiences with chemistry and that what we individually knew before could grow uniquely in our own ways.","Professor [Removed] always talks about how peoples' experiences in highschool will have an affect on how they perform in [Removed]. She says that it will be harder for students who did not cover the [Removed] material in highschool, but she encourages them and helps them along the way.","Professor [Removed] today talked about how physics and biology have similar terms but are all slightly different due to the subject matter, however they were all right.","Having multiple professors offer videos is showing of this. As students we have option to look for multiple videos form different professors and learn. This allows us to get a better understanding of different teaching methods.","My instructor always encourages students to approach the course in different ways to gain new insights. To accommodate this, my instructor provides students with several resources to meet their needs.","We talk about how the laws of chemistry come from different places and it takes different people to come up with something that works.","There wasn't really a need for this. Chemistry is universal that doesn't apply variety of perspectives.","When we talk about all the experiments and people that were needed to get to the knowledge that we know now. Every single person was integral to the discoveries.","Well when talking about chemistry you have to take into account the different theories and experiments that people had. The professor mentioned multiple theories that scientist with different perspectives.","studying is good","On how different scientists's experiments came together to form new knowledge. And how they impacted the future.","My professor has stated that the advancement of chemistry over time has greatly contributed to its development through multiple different perspectives. These perspectives include those of famous chemists who go off of each other's work to uncover world changing discoveries.","My instructor emphasized the necessity of many views in contributing uniquely to knowledge throughout our exploration of morphology in our colonies. I believe this occurred last week.","I do not remember a specific moment.","[Removed], Dr. [Removed] and [Removed] all work to promote individual knowledge and teamwork throughout the lab, which requires an understanding that we all have unique experiences and backgrounds!","The whole idea of research is that many people are taking a look at something or working on a project. Some people may see something or have an idea that others don't see due to their background. This was prevalent in the lab when we chose where to pick soil from. Different backgrounds, interests, and knowledge may have contributed to picking just the right sample.","She allowed us to talk about what we thought was going on with our bacteria.","We learned that doing research based inquiry learning, new and different perspectives were better for learning and we need to ask questions rather than memorize answers.","I clicked the wrong box this did not occur.","In lots of course introductory and pre - lab material as well as the goal of our project is it very clear that multiple perspectives are necessary. \n","The concepts of this course are ethically driven and require a broad perspective of real - world issues. When explaining the background for this course, both professors and TA's have told us since the beginning to look at the [Removed] crisis from various perspectives as prospective future leaders.","The instructor knew that we all had different backgrounds and knowledge coming into the lab course, and those who already have prior lab skills can help the others around them","The professor does not speak to us. I have only seen her in class once. Most of the work is handled by the TA who does a great job of showing a variety of perspectives.","She always tell us to take into consideration everyone's perspective and ideas within our group, to make sure that everyone can contribute to our final idea. This helps avoid making mistakes and make sure that everyone within our group is on the same page.","The platform for our research comes from a group called [Removed]. This group encourages the idea of crowdsourcing and hence contributes to the idea that a variety of perspectives are necessary.","I am not too sure.","Power point and verbal instructions.","The instructor uses perspectives from a variety of groups and demonstrates that we learn best by using the multitude of opinions from the class. She also allows everyone to uniquely contribute, thus bolstering this claim.","[Removed] often asks the entire table about our results and is always available to answer any questions we may have.","We have a weekly discussion in which we all get together to discuss contrasting takes on current - real world events.","They let us have different interpretations as long as we can back them, and we either compromise or collectively build on each others knowledge.","This has been very present in the online perusal assignments that we have to do. In order to understand and respond to relevant videos and news that challenge our perspectives on different scenarios.","The instructor describe the procedure of the lab for everyone to understand her.","[Removed] is always open to repeating the procedure. For example, when subculturing the master plates, our group was uncertain about the rationale behind the need for 32 bacterial selections. [Removed] took the time to explain numerous reasons behind the procedure. For example, she claimed that it reduces the need for repeating the experiment if one master plate is influenced by a spreader. It also provides more choices for the researchers to choose from.","They talked about people from different backgrounds coming together for research. A big tenant of [Removed] is also diversity.","She made sure to emphasize that there is no right or wrong answer to a problem. The results we get will vary and all we need to do is be able to support our own findings.","In the perusall activities, it's imperative to use a variety of perspectives in order to complete the assignment. The activities have a foundation in encouraging discourse and even disagreement on ethical topics of discussion, where multiple perspectives are valued.","N / A","One of the main objectives in taking this class is to provide students with research - based learning as opposed to lecture - based. We have read in class that people from different backgrounds respond to lecture - based learning in different ways, with many students not benefiting from this structure. We have been taught in class that it's important to structure class so that everyone can participate where they may not have otherwise and aid in the research towards solving the antibiotic crisis.","By looking at something in a unique way you can come up with a new result","Every week we have ethics assignments due that discuss the variety of perspectives in the scientific field and historical context for what we are studying.","The variety of perspectives are necessary and we learn about that in the pre labs because we look at several sources when we read.","Our perusal assignments teach us about having various perspectives and that it is important to respect these perspectives but make sure to discuss them. These perspectives allow us to learn more.","During the pre - lab assignments, we read and wrote about [Removed] [Removed]'s mission statement, which included this point.","Brings up different methods that researchers use when we are sub - culturing or co - culturing. She constantly asks us questions about how this is going to be useful and how it's going to contribute to what we are looking into when growing the bacteria.","He tells us when we're wrong and when we're right. It isn't good to always think we're right.","In the course, the instructor allowed us to work with groups to complete labs.","Our instructor always asks us for feedback and questions throughout each lecture so that she can hear exactly what each student has to say. In this way, she makes a statement : a variety of perspectives are necessary and can uniquely contribute to new knowledge","My instructor has shared their thoughts on the importance of why every student needs to have their input shared since it can contribute to our lab experiments and procedures.","Sawyer ensures that we all ask questions about different aspects of the experiment to hear different thought processes and clear up confusion.","Amazing course wish [Removed] would provide more courses like this.","When we were trying to determine whether why one of our group mates gram - staining isolate was straight purple. She told us to all look at it to make a reason as to why it was like that. \n October 28th, 2024","For this statement, I briefly remember talking about [Removed] and how his experiment was done by only him, and his work was not accepted until after his death as people wanted to test the same plant to see if they got the same results. I may remember how [Removed] might have faked his ratios and that hence why it is important to do multiple experiments with different researchers.","She mentioned this at the beginning of the semester, and expressed how different views and perspectives can contribute to new knowledge.","Dr. [Removed] encouraged us over email to attend a variety of events pertaining to AI and research seminars that were happening this week. This is a regular occurance for the class.","She said that different perspectives bring different solutions","[Removed]","The professor allows us to talk and converse about our opinions ad thoughts even when some of them are conflicting.","She has us collaborate on questions and assignments. This allows us to explore new perspectives amongst our classmates.","i don't remember when it happened but she definitely said something like, \" everyone has different ways of looking at things, and there is no one correct way. Everyone contributes in their own way. \"","The instructor constantly emphasizes group discussion, which inherently requires people of diverse backgrounds to contribute.","By talking about different experiments in biology, this emphasizes the importance of many perspectives in discovery in science.","She encourages students to answer and give explanations to specific topics in the course. This helps to encourage participation in the class and gather different perspectives.","This hasn't been something that has needed to be said in class as of yet, but I feel like she definitely would","Dr. [Removed] didn't specifically say this, but she did randomly assign everyone into small groups and always makes sure to call on every group. She is very open and wants everyone in the class to learn and participate. I do consider this to be seeking out and drawing value from a large variety of perspectives, even though she didn't say those words specifically.","I can't remember exactly what she said, but she did mention that college is for exploring and developing new ideas. Especially after this first test, she mentioned that perhaps finding a new study method is most ideal to obtain a more favorable grade.","It's important to collaborate with others ( especially your team ) to better learn the material.","Dr [Removed] emphasized that we needed to try to explain our answers and even if we get it wrong she encourages us to be confident in our wrong answers.","She promotes collaboration on our quizzes and homework which helps because everyone can help each other. One person may be able to explain a concept better than another person.","During lecture Dr. [Removed] constantly reminds us of the importance of asking questions. She says that everyone has a unique perspective and through asking questions we can share that perspective with each other.","She often reminds us that asking questions is essential and important to the nature of learning. She reminds us as well to not be afraid!",".Professor [Removed] states that using your own view can help decipher topics. This happened last week","We write exit tickets where we consider our lives outside of academia. We wrote about aspects of life that are important to us and what we consider the motivating aspect of our lives.","When we were working in teams","We did an exit ticket where we had to write about the impact we want to make given our own life experiences. She emphasized that everyone's unique perspectives can take them far regardless of their backgrounds or identities.","She's mentioned how it's important to take the knowledge from introductory biology and chemistry together to understand genetics. We also have ethics talks that brings in another perspective.","Dr. [Removed] mentioned that there are many perspectives that allow for things in science to make [Removed] the way something makes sense to one person is different from others. Listening to many different perspectives allows for further knowledge and more diversity.","My professor will usually start a class with some event or discovery relevant to physics. This typically includes him briefly telling us about who made the discovery and possibly their background.","When Asking questions in class, he wants multiple people to answer and contribute to discussion","The instructor would present knowledge based on examples of different cultures. This happens during different problems and examples such as the video of gravity on the moon.","In terms of appreciating diverse backgrounds, during the first week of class Dr. [Removed] had us talk on an online forum about our previous experiences with physics ( if any ). We shared a variety of responses, from AP [Removed] 1 and 2 in high school, to never having done a physics problem in our life, yet he told us that despite such differences, we would all have new things to learn and all had the chance to succeed ( \" everyone can learn physics! \" ). In terms of appreciating diverse perspectives in the present, just today Dr. [Removed] was emphasizing how there are numerous ways to approach any given physics problem and that we don't have to do exactly what he does when solving to get it right.","He never addressed this topic because the differences in perspectives in not very relevant to the course. Physics does not require different perspectives, rather a universal understanding of the concepts and laws presented.","In [Removed], the professor continuingly says to turn your neighbor because they offer valuable insight and feedback. Many times, [Removed] needs a second, a third, and even a fourth opinion. The professor also offers anecdotes and real - life examples of physics in motion provided with their stories.","The professor continues to encourage us to ask questions so we can clear up and confusion. \n He once said \" No question is a stupid question, this is how we learn \"","Can't think of specific examples \n","When learning how to solve problems, we are give multiple ways to solve it. He has also gone over the different ways with examples during class.","Our instructor always made sure that we collaborated with the people sitting next to us on problems. He made sure we did this everyday in class.","I m not sure \n","He brings up past scientists and current ones, and constantly alludes to how history's different perspectives of physics join together to create the curriculum.","The instructor will often ask the class to double check his work as well as ask for the answers to questions, which could be different from student to student. This allows for discussion over proper methods and the importance of multiple perspectives.","said working with peers is good so you have different approaches","Always talks about what it took to get to the moon, or perform an experiment on the moon. Always explains problems in at least 2 different ways and tries to do a model to showcase the concept in class.","I think becasue physics is more cut and dry we do not really talk about perspectives when it comes to the material that much. however, after a hard midterm 2, Dr. [Removed] did talk about different perspectvies when it comes to our jobs in the future.","Whenever we begin discussing a new topic, he discusses the history of it and sometimes goes all the way back to its discovery. He acknowledges that people may have struggled or made mistakes when trying to discover the concept, but that's just a part of learning.","He details all the different methods of solving a problem","Dr. [Removed] has incorporated reflections into the course about growth mindset. He asked us to think in the perspective of another student and the potential factors that could impede their success in the class","When we were doing kinematics ( velocity and direction stuff ) Dr. [Removed] would often talk about how there were multiple ways to approach the problem. He didn't ever say \" there is one way to do this \", but he would say heres a bunch of equations you can make them fit into what you want, some will be easier to work with and others require more work.","We have surveys where we reflect on our perspectives in the class. In these surveys we reflect on our mindset regarding the class and the proper mindset we should have to succeed in the class.","That I don't remember well. I just thought he had","Dr. [Removed] always refers back to important people who have made contributions to physics and the importance of their contributions. He always gives credit to the people who designed the models in which he is teaching and seems like he truly respects and appreciates their contributions.","Give multiple examples with demos","When we talked about how the equations are derived and about [Removed] and the guy who came before him.","During the course we were learning about kinematics near the beginning of the semester and Dr. [Removed] explained how a variety of perspective contributed to the formulation of these equations and the knowledge we now have about physics","He mentioned this in class as he was talking about how he wants us to collaborate. It is important to work with classmates to learn from eachother.","How we have to think more logically and use our critical skills to get the answer.","Usually this happens when demonstrating something or going through a problem to see if we're aware of or have experience with the physics knowledge in our daily lives, through things like driving or hanging room decor.","While talking about hoe to look at a problem in a different perspective in order to solve a problem.","He says we all succeed in different ways.","He has said soemthing along these lines in class. W e all cromf rom difefrent backgrounds of physics knwoledge!","He gives opportunities for students to give their own opinions on problems and ask questions when they believe he may have done something wrong.","Dr. [Removed] always lets us speak in discussions and offer our viewpoints. He also always asks and makes sure everyone understands this material.","Sata talked about how certain diseases are more common in certain populations. He talked about this during unit 1 in regards to certain genetic disorders.","There's not exactly a unique experience. It goes more with the material as a lot of molecular biology aspects can't be explained, so it requires several different perspectives to really understand some concept in the course.","\n The teaching assistants have provided background on how they have dealt with the class in the past.","My instructor stated that when viewing how the life came to form on [Removed], there are many aspects such as reducing conditions and abiogenesis that could explain how life formed. These different perspectives contribute to new knowledge.","A variety of perspective assists in learning knew knowledge especially about a difficult course like this","During several lectures Dr. [Removed] told us our learning experiences are different and we may need to look at the situation differently to understand it.","He talked about the fact that you can not memorize facts, you need to have a general knowledge and understanding of the subjects we were learning about to truly comprehend and remember them.","In the course, Dr. [Removed] discusses the various topics within biology. By doing so, he reminds everyday in class how it is important to utilize knowledge we have previously learned from other lectures to apply and learn about the newest lesson that we are learning. This is in order to assist us and lead us toward the right direciton.","We are often shown different possible perspectives on different types of questions and topics, such as free - response questions. When appropriate, we are informed of the different ways to think about problems and topics and told to keep an open mind when solving such types of problems.","tell us the knowledge that we need to know and leave out. other study strategies, the steps to do well","When discussing different scientific methods and also the creation / formation of [Removed]. ( explained that people can have different religious values, but that we were going to use the scientific theory in class. )","At the beginning of the course, Dr. [Removed] explained to us that a curiosity in the biological field and a diverse range of perspectives helps to solve issues or discover new aspects.","He explained different hypothesis to the origin of life. This happened at the end of last month when we started a new unit.","While some may interpret this class as merely being coding, a variety of skills and opinions can be used to enhance the learning experience. This can be seen in our contribution to class data and data analysis of real - world objects.","She says there are multiple ways to complete a coding assignment and you can use your prior experience / alternative code to come to the same answers as what she teaches in class","Encouraged students to talk with peers. Explained importance of having multiple perspectives on methods of handling data.","I mean statistics is based around many different varying viewpoints so I feel like any time we look at a dataset we have to consider that there are multiple perspectives necessary. We definitely go over many scenarios and situations so I know she does.","She will ask if anyone has any questions or comments about a certain situation or circumstance and will allow us to share our opinion or question","She explains that is important to take a multi faceted approach to solving problems in regards to this class.","Dr. [Removed] may hear 2 different perspectives of students, that at times might be right, and in those situations highlights how both perspectives work.","She did all time","Teamwork through labs and projects and an emphasis on collaboration","Has stated data perspectives matter \n","She presents datasets from many disciplines and across many areas of study. With this she expands that being well - rounded and analyzing vast data is educational.","She is a great instructor and accommodates to everyone","She allowed students to have their own time to consider questions and provided group work.","She would talk about it in lecture.","Professor [Removed] would take answers from a variety of students, saying that \" No one answer i d correct \" due to different experiences.","I can't remember exactly, but I do know that a lot of the example given in class require you to have a unique perspective on the topics.","I can't really recall when the instructor used multiple perspectives, but if she would have she would ve probably used different religions or ethnicities for a certain data set.","When asking questions out to the class, [Removed] always takes a variety of student responses even if they might be incorrect to ensure a variety of perspective to overall come to a consensus later on why the correct answer is correct.","When allowing students to assign themselves groups, the instructor stressed that a variety of perspectives and outlooks working on the same problem could help students learn.","She emphasized that learning only occurs when you are willing to offer up ideas that might be wrong.","We were both in co - ops so sometimes we talk about it. It is an odd experience.","She made sure to call on a variety of people to ensure all perspectives are collected.","I can't remember an specific instance, but Professor [Removed] often encourages us to work on Course packet problems in groups. Additionally, our weekly labs are done in groups as well.","Professor [Removed] makes sure to include real world examples when using the descriptive analysis techniques we have learned in class. We learn about different perspectives and ways to acquire knowledge in both the context of the problems and how it is applied or was developed in the real world.","Discussed a deep dive into a real world statistical scenario.","She brought this up when speaking about ecological research and how different scientific perspectives are important in the field and how different levels of experiments are useful to ecological knowledge.","Ecology is a large field with many different paths to take. A variety of these ecologists typically work together on a problem / solution.","The instructor asks students to respond with their opinions on climate change and how it affects the environment.","I think it was a week or two weeks ago the she discussed the importance of networking and value of professional relationships.","Ecological concepts presented to us were helped bridged in our minds by connecting the concepts to earlier classes we might've taken ( i.e evolution or genetics. ) This made the material more digestible as the material got more complex.","I said slightly certain on the past question, but it was in lecture, and she was going over different experiments and different studies throughout ecology. Different people with different backgrounds who were pivotal in ecology were mentioned, but I don't remember exactly what was said.","She has us engage in multiple group projects to learn how to work together and learn from other's ideas and perspectives","The instructor allowed us to contribute with one another since the beginning of the class and lets us know that it is important to work together due to the importance of a variety of perspective","I can't remember an exact time. Dr. [Removed] [Removed] supports the idea in sharing what you know and how you know it, in order to understand things in different ways if you are struggling.","Well since this is an ecology course, she emphasizes the improtance of different perspectives when tackling ecology problems.","In class the professor always emphasizes the importance of collaboration and expressing thoughts and opinions. She does this by asking students questions to respond to and having students discuss questions with each other.","Dr. [Removed] encourages us to work as a group to complete our [Removed] Notes. She encourages us to practice data analysis if we aren't as familiar with it as other members of our group.","she regularly gives us new and different ways to think about it, mainly for the in class quizzes. this is usually daily.","In class, she always talks about how physics is difficult, and most of the time you have to fail to succeed. She talks about how you have to gain new perspectives of physics and different ways to complete different task to create new knowledge and figure out solutions.","Always provide her own experiences and says not to give up","Several times during lectures, my instructor would discuss how she grew up in [Removed], and talks about her life experiences regarding physics with that perspective. She also is a follower of Growth Mindset, which is unique to every individual due to their own life experiences. However, she never stated exactly that \" a variety of perspectives are necessary and can uniquely contribute to new knowledge \".","The instructor has talked about everyone's different approach to learning multiple tines in class.","She will explain physics concepts in different ways so that we all have a fair chance of understanding the concept behind it, as we all have different levels of prior physics knowledge.","She gives us different ways to solve problems so we can consider many approaches. This helps in thinking outside of the box.","At the beginning of class, sometimes she would talk about the different perspectives can help contribute to knowledge","When she asks us a question.","There are different ways to come to the same conclusion regarding this course. She provides multiple solutions for students when preforming examples in class.","Collaboration during Squarecaps","The professor is very open minded and considers new view points.","Explains how physics comes from all around the world and how different ideas have shaped what we know today so often times we should look to our classmates for explaining concepts.","The teacher suggested forming study groups to learn how other people approached and solved problems so that one can modify their learning habits.","The professor frequently emphasizes different perspectives and different answers to classroom questions, to encourage discussion and deep thinking.","Again, after the midterm the professor was discussing the various challenges college students come across and how it is all part of the process.","He asked all of use what were our favorite scientists were and for what reasons. Additionally, he goes over the historical context of certain discoveries in the prelab assignments.","On Monday, Dr. [Removed] talked about the bucket experiment. He asked us to think what is the water was rotating with respect to.","Some of these would seem a little weird to include in a physics course but he did bring up his own personal experiences dealing with different thought process, in reference specifically to the first midterm which not everyone did well on.","Dr. [Removed] will often ask us to consider problems / situations that do not necessarily have a singular correct answer. He then tells us that as long as we can accurately defend our position, our perspective should be considered.","This happened for example when the professor explained how to count degrees of freedom using two different methods, but he arrived at the same result. This form of teaching applies to other concepts.","Once, the instructor described how different physicists had views on the fundamental importance of laws such as the 2nd [Removed] of [Removed] or [Removed]'s equations. This happened during the respective unit on entropy, and it allowed students to think of differing academic opinions.","The example that came to mind was when discussing how a theory was developed and she explained how the idea went through many different individuals who added to it before it became a theory.","We have activities to talk to our classmates and we were able to see unique point of view","Mentioned the importance of teamwork and how keeping an open mind opens up new ideas. This was done during a discussion lecture.","I can't recall an exact example, but Dr. G always gets a variety of answers when she asks the class questions and responds to all of them.","They mentioned during lecture how people learn in different ways.","I m not sure but she has mentioned different scientific researchers and how there opinions differed. This led to different discoveries like when we talked about [Removed].","I meant to click once a week for this as well as the fact she has done this in the past week. My professor does this when she looks at physics problems. She tells us about different ways we may analyze the problem and the variety of ways we may try to solve it after she explains her own methods.","I'm not confident in my recollection of this instance but I believe I've heard something similar.","In physics, there are different theories and models that are evolved from when they are first created. Physics doesn't necessarily use human examples that are relevant to diversity and inclusion.","Talked about multiple physicists throughout history and also provided new methods of solving similar problems thus showcasing different perspectives are necessary to understanding complex concepts","Dr. [Removed] is always asking us if we have questions and wanting students to participate. She emphasizes that even if you are wrong it is okay as long as you are trying. She loves to hear everyone's answers and train of thought.","She always allows us to collaborate rate with other students as she wants different views and for us to see different ways when solving a problem","Used examples of real world physics that we see in our everyday lives","I believe he said something along the line that however the question is solved(using different methods and equations ), if we get to the same answer, we are welcome to use that certain method.","Asks for multiple ideas of a certain topic like relative position in a classroom","The instructor mentioned that we needed to open our mind in order to fully understand physics beyond just memorizing equations and applying them. This happened during class time right before we transitioned into talking about dynamics.","Even when students answer questions incorrectly Dr. [Removed] goes over why the way of thinking about that problem may be a misconception and how to correct it.","N / A","Dr. [Removed] often presents a question / problem in lecture and asks the class how we would go about answering or solving it. He takes our suggestions ( even if it isn't exactly how he would do it or want us to do it ) and shows us that we can approach the problems in different ways. This happens quite frequently, and its very encouraging to feel like there is no \" one right way \" of thinking / problem - solving.","At the beginning of the course, the instructor mentioned how our backgrounds, especially those that come from underprivileged upbringings, may face challenges that those close to home may not be able to help with.","Provided slides about minores and certificates.","[Removed] always wants us to talk about experience and how to apply it. She is very nice about communication.","We went over a lot of perspectives and how they would impact us.","Sometime during weekly seminars, [Removed] emphasized the importance of a diverse resume. Specifically, how things seemingly unrelated to career field can still be helpful during job application.","In class","He was discussing how a scientist had come up with certain equations but they were named after another scientist because he was able to add something to the equations ( almost like the missing piece and link them all together. This probably happened within the last week.","He shares how you need to visualize the circuits to be able to figure out the correct equations and usages.","At the beginning of the course, the professor mentioned that each person's unique perspective is important to their experience in the course and in their endeavors as a whole. Again, since then, that hasn't happened.","They like when people raise their hands and put in their input during lecture. This helps include everyone and get everyones perspective","Connect topics to outside sources","Professor [Removed] allows for each student to speak openly and include their personal ideas and perspectives in class. Professor [Removed] is very inclusive and makes everyone feel comfortable to speak openly.","Not sure how this question can be answered directly because it is not a common topic spoken about in any of my classes, but similar to the question before she has made it clear that people no matter their knowledge or past experiences, can succeed. So it is given that using your past knowledge can help to learn and be successful. She has pointed out that people learn through different techniques and recognizes there is not a linear way of learning for the entire class.","I can relate this question to how she asks students first why they chose an one answer, and hearing from different student's perspectives provides us new ways of looking / thinking about a problem.","In the course, the teacher often talks about different perspectives. This happened two weeks ago for example when the professor asks different students with varying answers to a question their individual perspectives on the answers and tries to understand how these students came to different conclusions. The instructor listened to both perspectives and explained in a very helpful way why one answer is more accurate than the other.","Professor [Removed] gave considerate advice at the start of the course and a couple times since then which addressed how different student backgrounds could impact our learning experience and potential career interest. She also presented the work of scientists of various backgrounds.","They always tell us there are many different paths to take and each is unique. \n","This was used during a note - taking exercise. This was during the first couple of weeks of school. The instructor provided a loose, quick - based lecture where it described a kite in a non - obvious way but it incorporated different perspectives to decipher the puzzle.","During a class discussion on a complex topic, [Removed] highlighted the importance of diverse viewpoints when learning. This approach encouraged students to share their thoughts openly in collaborative study sessions, fostering an inclusive environment where everyone felt valued, which significantly enhanced our learning experience. \n","He talked about different minds can't contribute go mew knowledge. A lot of people think differently and that can help in classes.","I am typically not the best at recalling specific moments, but I do remember Mr. [Removed] stated that [Removed] 108 is meant to help us transition into a much different lifestyle of college life. He stated that this is because many of us come from different educational backgrounds and may or may not need extra assistance. For example, while many others may easily figure out their personal lives through a simple list in their brain, he stated that others may find that creating a calendar will significantly improve the chaos of our classes and social lives.","During class discussions [Removed] makes sure to ask everyone's opinion and compare our differences. This helps us see others perspectives and give us new knowledge about different topics.","Our professors ensure that all students participate in our class discussions as they value hearing all of our perspectives and how we think a specific problem in education can be addressed. This is apparent in our weekly discussions, where we are meant to read an article and answer a few questions about it, relating the article's content to our own lives and personal experiences.","My instructor stated at the beginning of the semester that we are bright students and if we share our knowledge then we can learn new perspectives. He emphasized the importance of not being narrow - minded and has told us this throughout the year.","It was explained in the beginning of the semester that he understands that sometimes people make mistakes. Professor [Removed] said that he will allow us to take each exam twice and average out the grades just in case we were going through something that week.","Trying new ways to study can improve your study habits","My instructor would make sure to ask all of us ( variety of perspectives ) to put in our opinions before moving on to the next topic.","Dr. [Removed] would emphasize during class that we are all different, therefore we all have different strategies, methods, and various different ways of learning."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

She talks about how her students are different yet we are all in this class and we should build each other up.","I remember especially in the beginning of the course that the professor told us that college would be challenging and hard to adjust to. She even mentioned her own experience and emphasized how it was a lot different than ours. After this she gave us encouraging words and advice to help us with the transition.","The teacher talked about how different high schools taught different background information so we recapped the basic information to make sure everyone is on the same level.","Encourage us to join orgs that are correlated to chemistry. She'll say join these clubs for help.","My instructor has made our class a safe space, but since it is chemistry and more objective of a class nothing has been stated explicity","A good example of this is today, we were going over [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] and Dr. [Removed] was explaining how to find the formal charge of an atom. While lecturing she mentioned how all it takes is practice to get good at [Removed] [Removed] [Removed], and that people who had done this in previous classes may be at an advantage when it comes to this subject as different teachers taught different things.","not sure","She offers many different learning recourses to cater to differing student needs and challenges","It happens before learning a new topic. She would say that if you remember high school chem some topics will be easier than other if we've never taken chem the topics may take more time to grasp.","My instructor has mentioned that students will catch on to the material at different paces. She has discussed that not everyone has taken chemistry before or maybe that some of us have not taken chemistry since our sophomore year of high school ; thus, she makes it apparent that it is necessary we go to office hours if extra help is needed, but acknowledges that not everyone is going to get [Removed] on the test and that it may take time to get the hang of things.","She said something about how some people will come in with prior knowledge and different learning habits.","My professor has harped on how students from different backgrounds will have different experiences and how different students knowledge over course material may differ. Students who grew up in a private school or school of science prepatory will have a completely different background than a student who grew up from another country.","She talked about the challenges of entering college life a few lectures ago.","she mentions when we wil have prior knowledge from [Removed] or ap chemistry \n","i can not remember a specific time","My professor told students that not everyone had the same chemistry classes in [Removed] School so some of the information may be easier to others.","They allowd for accommodations to take place. They helped those students/","In the beginning of the course, the professor acknowledged that we all come from different high schools and have different levels of knowledge about certain topics. She then proceeded to tell us that she would do her best to make the class as understandable as she could to everyone.","As a college student, navigating the academic world can be tough, especially if you come from a disadvantaged background. It's hard enough to keep up with the challenging coursework, but sometimes it feels like there are extra hurdles to overcome.","She is somewhat understanding about circumstances and once you contact her I think","Dr. [Removed] often describes topics as \" approachable, \" and that we are all capable of tackling them withe ease.","She has discussed giving every individual in the classroom a fair opportunity and succeeded. She has done this by giving us many opportunities to succeed through office hours, practice exams, and extra - credit opportunities.","She mostly just talks about how everyone has different backgrounds before college, so even if you feel like you're behind, that you are not. You might just need to put in more effort to try, and get up to the pace of the course.","Dr. [Removed] takes her time going through the slides she presents during class. She also goes in - depth with her explanations about the topics and how she arrived at an answer.","In the beginning of the course the professor described how it was a class for STEM majors. She also described how some of our experiences in the class depends on prior chem experiences and the chem readiness course. \n","In the beginning of the year, Mrs. [Removed] stressed the importance of meeting new individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, considering that students from all over the nation attend this university. With this comes the underlying recognition that people come from all backgrounds, and that it is important to respect the diversity within my peers and build a culture of mutual support so that everyone can succeed.","At the beginning of the term she expressed understanding concerning people's different backgrounds and experiences. She said that not everyone is coming in with the same knowledge due to lack of good, extensive education or simply naturally struggle with things more. She suggested tutoring and office hours for those who feel they need to catch up.","I believe she stated something the first week about how accommodating to college is a lot harder for some students than others. She hasn't talked on it much, but she did mention it a few times.","Dr. [Removed] makes students aware that no matter our previous experience in learning [Removed], we are able to succeed through hard work and utilizing our resources.","Brought up how we should already know certain things from high school and if not, gave us resources to help understand them at the beginning of the semester.","She helps a lot.","Depending on prior chemistry background / knowledge, Dr. [Removed] makes it clear that failure is OK and a learning curve instead of a permanent setback and catching up, is not impossible by any means","Sometimes our professor brings up that we have different knowledge bases due to have coming from different high schools.","The instructor has talked about regardless of how prepared we have been through high school or otherwise, the class will still be a challenge. She's also acknowledged that college will be harder than high school and made sure we know about the effort we have to put in.","They will have unique challenges in adjusting to the class size. Further, they can have a hard time learning the content at the same speed they have.","She often talks about different majors. Today during class, she said mechanical engineering majors would be able to better understand the specific physics behind a rivet, while [Removed] only requires we know very surface level information.","Because due to covid, everyone has had a different learning experience. This affects everyone in a different way.","I remember my instructor discussing the challenge of this course and how things may come easy or harder to different people. She reassured us we have the ability to get through this course despite our unique challenges.","Almost every one of my professors explained this on one of the first days of class. She explained how if we don't have chemistry background we will struggle most with the conceptual ideas and if we have a background, the little accident mistakes will get us.","[Removed] just stated that it is understandable and she is aware that not everyone comes with \" basic \" knowledge that is expected from other professors. She allows us to start from whatever standpoint we are in and build on that. I find that super helpful and considerate of her.","The instructor explained how points are distributed. She also has given us ample opportunities to raise our grades including giving us two make up exams on the final day","The professor clarifies that everyone is coming from different backgrounds and may face different challenges. However, the professor also acknowledges that we may persist and overcome these challenges using hard work.","She implied it at the beginning of the 4th unit : Thermodynamics.","Dr. [Removed] usually refers to our high school education when referring to our prior experiences. It impacts the information we have of every topic.","Instructor defines that learning experience is not uniform, one size fits all, rather each student has their own journey based on what they have experienced.","Dr. [Removed] made it clear from the start of the semester that most of us will have to adjust to college and that we all came from different high schools or past education places. She said that although we will have different types of knowledge, that there is resources embedded into her course to make sure EVERYONE succeeds,","Dr. [Removed] explained how everyone will have a different way of success in the course and that extra effort in going to office hours and learning communities is necessary for success.","I am not confident enough to say, but she mentioned about challenges that were expected to happen before class began.","This was not described in detail that I can remember but I do remember mentions of resources for those who are having harder times and challenges and review modules to ensure student success despite background or prior experiences.","I accidentally pressed the wrong button, Dr [Removed] has not covered this in class primarily because it is an intro chem class.","There has not been much discussion of this because the class has so much information that needs to be taught. We have had question prompts provided to use to talk to the person next to us about our weekends and other things.","She spoke in depth on multiple occasions about mental health, its importance and resources we could use in case we were struggling. She also spoke about accommodations for students with disabilities.","In the beginning days of this class, my professor emphasized that we are all different in terms of prior knowledge and learning experience, but that we still belong in the course and if we put in the work an effort we will get the results we want. she also emphasizes that if the course is too hard for you there ARE alternative options to help us succeed throughout our academic journeys. She also posts announcements instructing and helping us throughout the course with our personal challenges and experiences.","This happened early in lecture when she does her regular short overview of course proceedings. She was discussing makeup test opportunities and mentioned how the variability in grades can be due to the fact that starting college is a unique and new experience","I can not recall a moment when my professor said this.","She had mentioned that [Removed] and its classes will be different for everyone depending on where we came from and that there is nothing wrong about that.","She probably said this in the first week of class","In the begining of the term, she told us that a lot of us will face challenges coming to college. We will have to adapt to new environments and overcome struggles but she told us hard work will be rewarded in the course.","Dr. [Removed] has mentioned that everyone enters the class with different knowledge levels and abilities but we all have the chance to succeed.","N / A","Our professor knows that most of us are freshman and has expressed that we utilize the resources availible to us in class. The course has a multitude of office hour oppurtunities.","She is very personable and she gives us so many resources to be successful \n","I think at the beginning of the year she mentioned something about this. I do remember her stating that people would have varying challenges","Several times when we have started a new topic, Dr. [Removed] will explain that while something may seem obvious to a few, others have not had experience with that topic or idea and reassures us that it's okay if we haven't. She is very good about making sure we understand that she knows students come from all different types of backgrounds, schools, and learning environments and wants to work with us!","Describes that some material in chemistry may be easier for students that had a positive vs negative learning experience with chemistry in high school. \n","Depending on their classes in high school and the environment people will face different obstacles when it comes to adjusting to college. Regardless you are able to succeed no matter what.","She talked about how some of us took chemistry before and some did not.","He mentions AP Bio from highschool, but if you don't have the background it won't effect you. Also he encourages us to take breaks when we are struggling and finding extra help.","[Removed] emphasizes us working together in lab and getting to know each other.","In my bio lab course, the instructor acknowledged that students come from diverse backgrounds and may face challenges in college, especially during the first lab session. For example, the instructor said, \" Some of you might have more lab experience from high school while others are learning these techniques for the first time, and that's okay — everyone progresses at their own pace. \" This created an inclusive atmosphere, allowing students to feel comfortable asking for help and recognizing that their backgrounds shaped their learning experiences. It was especially helpful in easing anxiety about performance and adjusting to lab work.","[Removed] has talked about his own background and how it connected to science and the creation of this course. Looks can be deceiving and he offers a helping hand to all","Yes she made sure people know that it is okay if someone understands and you don't as they may have done this before. She told us to feel free to ask questions and be as comfortable as possible.","In lab","don't think this was mentioned","[Removed] always shares about how her previous classes went and some of the challenges she faced being a student in that class. She talked about some courses that are hard and gave some advice.","No, he has never said this because it gives us the idea that we are set and can not improve.","I'm pretty sure I remember [Removed] talking about how a lot of the skills we're learning in lab will be extremely useful in preparing us for future lab or research - related content. He said that many people don't really have this type of knowledge early on and find it challenging to adapt, but this course is a good introductory course to ease a lot of people in.","The instructors made it clear that no lab experience is needed prior to joining the lab","We had videos about all kinds of different cultures and their impacts and demonstration of truth to everyone","The hands - on component of this class can be challenging, as students have never had this level of autonomy in discovery and technique. Professor [Removed] makes sure to ensure we are understanding the material needed to excel at the lab.","n / a","Students are on different career paths.","n / a","At the beginning of the year, the instructor explained that her assignments have 24 - hour grace periods. Life of a college student can be hectic, and having this no - questions - asked extra time allows students to prioritize their mental health over a course grade.","Our professor talked about how our high school experiences may have been different and gave us several resources to get an equal foundation in the class.","She knows that some of us have less experience in biology while some of us are more experienced, so she acknowledges that different people will face challenges associated with that. However, she provides ample time to learn and is always willing to help those who are a little behind or challenged. \n","At the beginning of the course she made sure to tell everyone that, while everyone has the opportunity to succeed, some people will be able to study less and succeed due to previous background knowledge.","I think she briefly talked about this at the beginning of class one day but is always encouraging and sweet.","Dr [Removed] is very understanding especially that most of the students are freshmen. She always asks about our non academic life and gives us grace for late work","I remember at the beginning of the semester, she would talk about prioritizing sleep and reducing stress because college brings a lot of change, and it can be hard. And I also remember that in her syllabus, she would talk about prioritizing your own health. And in her announcements and emails, she would remind us of the topics.","This instructor told us that a growth mindset was very important in the beginning of the year. She explained that the transition into college is very different than high school because it requires more autonomy.","My instructor mentioned that we all have different courses and come from different backgrounds. For example, there is an abundance of students who work and are full - time students, so she made sure to recognize the amount students have on their plates.","Today, Dr. [Removed] sent out an announcement reminding students that there's always time for improvement and would give tips on how to do better next time. She would also occasionally remind us that genetic is hard, and students should have an open mindset in class.","She is very understanding of the circumstances. The grading scale reflects this.","The professor gave us words of encouragement at the beginning of the semester and offers us campus resources if we find ourselves in a challenging predicament whether it is because of our background or experiences.","In the beginning of the year, Dr. [Removed] stated that specific topics involving stats and biology are needed to fully understand the class. This alluded towards the different challenges we as college students each face as we come in from different backgrounds with different experiences.","The instructors occasionally bring up background, but only use it as a way to positively uplift us and our learning.","At the beginning of the year, she told us about how hard it is to live independently and reassured us that we could do it.","She mentions it sometimes in class or office hours, but I'm not exactly sure when.","Let us do after class reflection","Before our exam, [Removed] always reassures us to take it easy and that we all might have different things going on so that we should take care of ourselves.","The instructor assured us that challenges were temporary and that we would all overcome them.","Dr. [Removed] is very kind and always reminds us to be mindful because we don't know what other people may be going through. She encourages going to office hours to get help and hosts 1 - on-1 meetings to go over exam problems with students.","Dr. [Removed] Constantly offers advice and general messages of encouragement during exam season.","I don't remember a specific moment but I remember Dr. [Removed] talking about how the content in this course spans other prior knowledges in other courses. She expected us to know about these already from said courses.","We were discussing the reflections done for the class. We were able to assess the challenges both internal and external that impact somebodies ability to succeed in this class ( and really any class ). We not only looked at some summarized data reflecting the different class views but discussed the possible reasons for those perspectives ( allowing class members to share out loud as they were comfortable ).","Dr. [Removed] emphasizes that there are things that students can and can't control in their learning. Some students deal with difficult emergency situations that make it harder for them to focus on learning.","I can't recall anything, but I know he cares.","I don't think he ever really does this. I have never felt like he says we can't succeed due to our past. He always advocates for the fact that our future is what tells the story.","He gave everyone equal opportunity to do well in the class. He probided additional help to those who needed it","We do assignments that are about growth and reflection. In these we can talk about how certain things happen and life and how we can still go about doing our tasks. Or, give ourselves grace when life happens.","This is another topic we cover in our frequent reflection assignments where we need to consider how our personal backgrounds might impact our ways of learning both now and in the future. We need to learn how to be dynamic in our learning styles in order to grow.","He mentioned some time closer to the beginning of the course that everyone will have a different experience in the class. He emphasizes working with peers to better assist the learning experience.","When I had came back to class after 3 weeks due to personal circumstances my professor was caring and reminded me that my circumstances are unfortunate and play a role in what's going on","He's discussed that our prior experience with physics may affect how well we understand the content. He's helped us have a growth mindset after exam 2.","He didn't really describe challenges that are unique to different students, but rather challenges that are common barriers to the college experience : sleep, food, exercising, etc. This was a reflection assignment and he's mentioned it multiple times during different classes ; he seems to understand that around the middle of the fall, students start to get tired.","We had an assignment last week that asked us to reflect on what we could and can not control how we do in this course. The professor followed up with a discussion during lecture.","Dr. [Removed] in the beginning of this course explained that this course may be difficult for those who have not tooken a math course in a very long time or a physics course. However, he provided tools to help us freshen up on old math/ algebra concepts.","Dr. [Removed] is very kind and open to all students. He had such a welcoming aura on the first day of class that carried on throughout the semester. He welcomes all kinds of questions and doesn't make you feel like you're dumb for asking even the simplest of questions. He's also a person of color who understands that students from all backgrounds and cultures have different experiences in college.","He encouraged us to think about what students can and can not control in class in his reflection assignments. He also introduced it on the very first week.","he explains that people may have different career pathways so they have different hurdles to go through than other people.","Professor [Removed] adds reflections as part of the course content and our overall grade. These reflections ( so far ) are insightful questions about how we navigate the course in order to be successful in it and makes us reflect on what possible steps we could be making in order to achieve this.","The instructor made us fill out a survey to discuss challenges students face in the course and had us talk about it during class with our neighbors.","After our second midterms he explained that there are many hard problems that students may face in the course, but by having a growth mindset can help combat those challenges.","we talked about growth mindset","The lecturer has asked for background with physics at the start of the semester.","n a discussion early in the semester, the instructor facilitated a conversation about the diverse backgrounds of our class and how these experiences might impact our transition to college. They stated, \" Each of you brings unique strengths and challenges ; recognizing these will help us support one another throughout this journey. \"","When students tried to push back the date of the exam to next week, they said that it would not be possible. They stated that you are going to face challenges in life that you can not change to your desire and you have to learn how to manage yourself. Students who put in the work to get into this university might know how to do so better than those who got in automatically, but this will help you learn for the future.","We were discussing how to prepare for the exam and the instructor pointed out how each person's style of studying is different and coming into college one must explore what is the best methods for them.","My instructor was lecturing, and this occurred around a month ago.","N / A","When going over how to study, he said that student's different backgrounds will have an effect on how much they study. For example, those who took AP [Removed] in high school would probably be less challenged than those who did not.","It was earlier on in the semester. I think it was a general reminder that college is different for everyone.","It was very light hearted, he mainly asked students if they have expereinces anything related to the course. Like if anyone is lactose intolerant, or if anyone has gone to certain places inthe world.","He takes into account peoples financial backgrounds and time commitements by providing us with a free square cap pass.","He just mentioned how this course is at a college level and how AP Bio isn't the same","Our professor has mentioned how everyone comes from different backgrounds and places, and that this is crucial to him while educating his students because everyone requires different learning methods.","he talked about how different we all are, with different paths of life.","I don't think he ever explicitly did this. The only time I can think of is at the beginning of the semester when Dr. [Removed] explained that he did not want his bio class to be a weed - out class. Yet, he doesn't really teach like he wants his students to be successful.","If I remember correctly, the professor in the opening lecture had asked us about our college experience and advised us about how to go through college. When doing this, she mentioned that the college experience is not one thing experienced by everyone, but you can go on different paths and will have different experiences / perspectives depending on your background. I do not remember the professor mentioning this topic again as she was focused on teaching the material which has nothing to do with this since it is a STEM class","She understands this might be people's first time coding. She goes at a good pace.","We code a lot in R, so having a background or at least know some basic will be better for the students.","[Removed] can't remember","She shared her own experiences and let us relate.","I can't remember a specific moment","I would say this is difficult to fully accomplish in a STEM course like data science, but we acknowledge the bias that is present in data analysis and the different methods of analysis.","She knows that some people have more experiences with coding and that some have less, but let's us know that we can still do good in the class.","I think this depends on different major and different background. so for coding, a lot of people just knows and good at coding","This was not said during lecture. It was also not mentioned any other time.","N / A","She tells us we each have our own strengths","She highlighted how certain things may come easier to students depending on their coding experience in the past in the beginning of the semester.","This happened once or twice as we were discussing the [Removed] report for our project progress. Students have variable interests which will impact what kind of datasets they choose to wrangle and visualize - this pertains to major, personal interests, hobbies, or life experiences. Depending on variable backgrounds, this can affect how far a student is willing to go in the complexity in which they analyze their data.","I am not sure I can recall an instance of that matter","I don't really know when she s done this","The instructor provides many different accommodations for quizzes and labs for students that may have different needs and makes sure that each student can succeed to the best of their ability in the course.","Acknowledge students will have circumstances different from others.","I do not remember the exact context where it was said, but the instructor also directly said that students will have different challenges based on their background and proceeded to work a problem in multiple different ways to exemplify the idea being expressed.","N / A","I can not recall this happening.","I do not recall all too well","She would talk about what stuggles we will go through as college students","During lecture, I remember a discussion in which Dr. [Removed] was describing that experience is an important factor in what challenges one will face.","The professor multiple times would remind the class that given her background as an international student her experiences were very different from ours.","In the first few lectures of the course, Dr [Removed] described that this course is mostly impactful for those in a future in ecology. With the course being in the integrative biology department, many of the students are pre - med, meaning that they will not gain much from the course. Dr [Removed] described in these lectures that ecology may provid unique challenges to those who have not taken ecology classes in the past and that they may not gain as much from this course.","She takes time in the beginning of lecture to talk about her experiences. In addition, she asks us how we are doing.","After the exam, we reflect on the scores and not everyone will do the same obviously but Dr. [Removed] is always open to discuss how to improve for the next exam in office hours","On syllabus day she explained the importance of having peers to study and discuss content with. She explained how she felt a bit isolated as an international student, so through that personal story she explained that backgrounds are important and that she empathizes with this specific struggle.","The professor talked about her own experiences as a grad student and how she faced feelings of isolation and exclusion from her peers.","She talked about her background when first coming here as an exchange student with a different background compared to everyone else during one of the class days. Then, she also gave advice for us and for those of us trying to go to grad school.","No clear recollection","She mentioned that we come from different places but with the resources provided we are able to succeed in her class.","She just mentioned it in the beginning of the course.","Talks about how we come from different majors","THE STUDENTS ALL HAVE DIFFERENT MAJORS SO IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE EVERYONE DISCUSS DIFFERENT TOPICS OF THE COURSE.","At the beginning of the semester she told us personal stories about how challenging it was for her to adjust to school here in [Removed] as well as being a mother and older while the rest of her peers were single and in their early twenties. She found a group of people to help through and she wants us to work in pairs or groups in case any of us are feeling alone in the class. She also makes it clear that she wants us all to pass and understand this class.","She mentioned how different people came to college with different backgrounds and emphasizes that everyone learned in diff ways","Professor gave us a story about how hard it was for her to succeed being a women and being foreign studying physics.","Explained her background from [Removed] \n","Nothing happened in the course, although our instructor talks a lot about being able to fax this course despite [Removed] unique challenges in college.","In the beginning of class, the professor always speaks on people's different experiences when it comes to physics and how their background and unique experiences shape their physics experience. She's very understanding and open minded in that regard.","She has spoken about how it feels to be a woman in STEM at the beginning of lecture multiple times.","She gave examples about her time in undergraduate studies during lecture. She talked about how her background and knowledge shaped her experience in education, and how the same can happen for us.","Teacher talks about her own personal experiences and background. For example, she mentioned how she failed one of her first major physics exams and thought that she wasn't good enough for physics","Dr. [Removed] described her college experience and the challenges she faced towards the beginning of the semester as well as any time the class claims to be having trouble. She provides encouragement to face these challenges as everyone experiences them whether they show it or not.","She tells us in most lectures that she had difficulty when she was first taking physics courses, so we should never feel alone.","She described her own struggles during college and how she has failed. However, it did not define her or her career.","[Removed] admits that she, herself, was sometimes doubtful of her capabilities but worked to overcome this and ultimately be successful.","She does this by talking about her own challenges when she was in college. Having her perspective makes me feel better as she talks about how everybody struggles and that it gets better.","She always talks about in her lecture's that we all come from somewhere different and learn different ways but those things will help you succeed.","She explain that we're all unique in our own way, and how we all come to college with different ways of learning as well as how our major May play a role in the amount of prior knowledge we may have. But regardless of our different backgrounds, she does NOT discriminate and she's very inclusive and accommodating. If you need extra support in understanding a topic, she is sure to help","At the beginning of class, she always has a growth mindset and emphasizes for us to reach out if her way of teaching or explanation isn't sufficient.","the professor talked about her own experiences and struggles and talked about how she wants everyone to feel comfortable with expressing feelings","I don't remember any experiences like that","He mentioned the struggles that he had in college early on and how that didn't deter him from pursuing physics as he went in the second or third week. He knows that we come from different backgrounds in physics in high school, so he makes sure that we understand that and approaches the problems from the base to make it easier to understand","The instructor clearly stated to us, at the beginning of most modules, that the class difficulty would depend on how well we were taught or learned calculus and the physics class prior to this one. They followed up with various resources to help fill in the gap of knowledge.","The instructor provides stats of the different majors that students are in.","I can not remember","I can briefly remember but the professor said that he went to a liberal arts school and ended up studying physics. He basically told us that students can experience many things and college can take you down different paths.","He shares the course material from different perspectives","That what we like will influence what we go into","Dr. [Removed] acknowledges that this class has people of many different physics backgrounds, which is why he gives out test correction. He also gives out very occasionally gives opportunities for extra credit.","He talked about a personal experience about having a difficult test his freshman year ; he talked about how he was in a different spot in his [Removed] learning compared to his other friends. He applied it to class to try to find other people who can help you within the class because everyone has different backgrounds in different classes.","After the first tests grades he r planned what happened to him after his first exam he took in college and was very supportive.","He acknowledges how there are people who have different goals within the class.","I remember before the exam the professor talked about how this course can be related to chemistry and quantum physics, and understanding those could be helpful in this course.","I can't recall a specific instance of this happening.","She did not do this","She always remembers or takes note of how many classes we have to deal with. She also acknowledges that this is a difficult course and that it's sometimes stressful dealing with everything.","She talks about how important it is to respect our background","Usually before lecture starts, our professor emphasized that this course is a hard topic especially for students with less prior physics knowledge. She provided us some possible resources like tutoring and office hours that could help","The professor has described how difficult university - level physics can be. She is understanding of that struggle that accompanies physics.","Professor [Removed] always encourages her students, especially when they are having trouble grasping a topic. She explains that we all have unique learning curves based on our learning style, background, and prior experiences.","The time that stands out to me the most is when Dr. [Removed] opened up about his own experience with college and how he failed his first physics course in college. He also opened up about his struggling to adjust to college because of mental health issues.","He talks about how educational background plays a big role in understanding a difficult subject like physics. He is very inclusive in encourages everyone despite background.","I can not seem to remember when my Professor has described a moment according to this prompt. Along with this I can not remember what happened if or when this was said.","During the course he was giving a lecture about our first exam and he mentioned that we should study. If we didn't have good teachers in highschool, he recommended that the students should go to office hours, TA office hours, or CSS review sessions.","Throughout the first weeks, she describes the way our study methods can overall vary. She explained to us that the way we manage our time can be based upon our preferences and goals also.","With all the resources provided, we are all made aware of the many challenges that might affect us and we were told who may or may not be more likely to be faced with these issues.","My instructor has described how students will have unique challenges based on our background on many occasions. It's typically not based on race but academic history and how that can play a role in our educational career. They always provided helpful and meaningful information.","He had all students respond to a survey to highlight our backgrounds.","Our instructor mentioned that taking [Removed] C in high school would make some content in class feel more familiar. This was during syllabus week.","This occurrence followed the posting of our first midterm's results. Our professor spent some time in a following lecture going over the results, and he made a point to emphasize the differences in each student's starting point in this class. We were made to understand that not everyone is on equal footing, and that's okay.","At the beginning of the semester, we did some icebreaker surveys about where we are from and our prior experience in physics. The instructor then brought up that everyone will have unique challenges because of prior experience and said that he would do his best to make the course the same level for everyone.","At the beginning of the year he acknowledged the difference in skill level or past physics experience and how this will affect skills levels for the class","The professor has discussed multiple times about how different people will have different levels of success in the course. He emphasizes varying levels of experience people have with physics and calculus, as well as the differing experiences people will have in physics and engineering going forward in college based on their major and career path. He has offered supplemental resources for students with a keen interest in learning more, and the TA's offer instruction for students that need assistance with specific concepts that won't be covered in depth in lecture.","Dr. [Removed] is very accommodating to students regardless of their backgrounds or experienced. She is very determined that all students in her class leave with a solid grasp of the material.","Different physics topic \n","Every class, Dr. [Removed] provides reassurance to students who may not have a background in physics. I am one of these students, and feel this is important, as the first two years are a time of \" levelling \", where all students will leave with the same base knowledge","She talks about and puts up slides of former students detailing their experiences. And how her and the former students have had their own struggles.","My prof shares a prior students experience at the beginning of lecture so that we can feel like we aren't alone","Professor [Removed] will often talk about other students experiences as well as have letters of students talking about their own experiences. These often tie to multiple different backgrounds and perspectives affecting the student and what they did to prosper.","Dr. [Removed] has slides for every lecture which has letters from students that have previously taken the course. These sometimes show different students backgrounds, explaining how their unique experiences give them power and resilience.","A lot of people including me had very little to no physics background, so [Removed] made sure we felt comfortable. She has made it as introductory as possible.","In the beginning especially, Professor [Removed] expressed that she understood that all of us came from very different,   non - physics majors, and she knew we were capable and intelligent, just maybe needed extra guidance in this particular subject. I appreciated this.","We all have different majors in the class and she has acknowedged that.","They explained how some students may find physics easier due to their background knowledge from high school, and that is alright, since students can still catch up.","On the first or second class day, the professor said that people who took [Removed] a longer time ago and/or somewhere else ( as opposed to at [Removed] last semester ) may have a more difficult time in this class, but that we can catch up to our peers.","I think I misinterpreted the question. In class, talked about and advised reaching out to graduate students in our fields of interests to gauge our interest before pursuing graduate school, because it's difficult.","My instructor would bring up how we might be used to different study strategies and might have gotten through classes differently than now. He does this many lectures and he provides constructive ways on how to improve our strategies to succeed in college.","[Removed] talked about first [Removed] college students in class before. He explain that there are many students who are first gene as well as given us resources to help us if we are first [Removed] students.","Based on what we're taking and what backgrounds we're all going to be challenged differently but that we have support in this class","The instructor talks about our differing cultural backgrounds and how they play a part in challenges that impact our college lives.","This is important because everyone learns in different ways and different techniques so it is important to make sure we are all aware of that."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

She did the same before our first exam, and it shows how confident she is in her students.","She lets us know that we are able to master everything in this course and anything outside of it.","She always encourages her students to believe they can accomplish great things, especially before exam time.","She just said how some of the information can be used in later classes and sometimes useful in the field.","In the modules","I only remember one moment where the professor mentioned the students were scientists or would be in some science career in the future.","She is very encouraging and always supportive of her students","Caudill is always striving to remind us that we are all capable of doing great in her class and she constantly reassures us of all the opprutunities we have to succeed in her class despite how difficult chemisty may be.","Just positive talk torwards us","The instructor made sure we know about opportunities for our majors.","she talks about the importance of the topic and knowing it in the future","I can not remeber a certain time","She always says we are smart students and will benefit from learning the chemistry information in the future.","At some point, I don't remember, [Removed] was giving us a pep talk, and stressed to us that we are scientists, that we are mastering subjects now, and it doesn't mean we have to be masters already.","My professor has told us that we all came to [Removed] for a reason and are in that class for a reason, that we chose this to become someone successful and make something of ourselves in the future.","I don't remember any specific examples, but as we go through material and get prepared for exams, she encourages us to do our best to succeed at what we want in life.","She does a great job with uplifting us.","She always reminds the class that we are capable of understanding this course. It's really encouraging to hear from a professor.","She mentioned this during class time a couple of weeks ago.","Frequently refers to how the course will be meaningful in the future. Often refers to her own personal experiences and how taking this course can lead to different opportunities.","The instructor was talking about [Removed] in the first test after Unit 3, and told us that we could really be successful if we used our brains and developed critical thinking skills.","nothing really happened","Daily she encourages us and talks us to so we feel confident in our abilities it helps a lot.","She has mentioned how this course will help in later courses but not necessarily any future accomplishments.","She is encouraging and has our best interest at heart","Dr. [Removed] always sends out announcements on [Removed] that are encouraging. She tells us that we are super capable on doing well on her exams, and encourages us to take breaks as necessary. She says she believes in us a lot. [Removed]. \" You got this, don't forget to take breaks. Reach out for help, and talk through content with a friend, if you can. \" \" We are rooting for you! Take breaks as needed, and don't forget the power of talking out concepts with others. \" \n\n","She is very optimistic and tells us to not stress too much over our exam scores as they do not define us or our future. She especially tells us this after an exam.","Dr. [Removed] said that we are an integral part of the future.","The instructor's syllabus describes that she wants students to feel empowered to achieve success.","The instructor consistently emphasized our potential by highlighting our individual contributions during discussions, often pointing out how our insights connected to real - world applications. They frequently shared examples of past students who had gone on to achieve significant outcomes in their fields, reinforcing the idea that we, too, could become experts. This approach created a motivating atmosphere where we felt valued and inspired to take ownership of our learning, making it a powerful experience for anyone looking for encouragement and affirmation in their growth.","I emailed her during the class, and she was very encouraging and said that it is ok I will understand it will just take time since we are just adjusting to a new environment.","She says how we are smart and we can do this no stress.","Yes discusses us as future doctors and engineers","The professor shared what she had done previously for work and how her degree helped her learn the many skills needed for her previous employment.","Our professor wants us to succeed and pushes us towards achieving a good grade and good knowledge for a future course","Rather than this being something repeated, it was greatly emphasized in the opening weeks, and I feel that this sentiment carries strongly onto later weeks. It's currently more articulated as how current material will be foundation for later learning if we are to continue in chemistry heavy professions, and how mastery of this content will be very beneficial.","Dr. [Removed] will talk about how the STEM majors are students that will succeed in life if we put our minds to it and that the material is meaningful for the success. She says this typically before the lecture over the course material begins.","The professor has mentioned how what we are learning is important and how it will benefit our future. This happens sometimes when we apply real examples into chemistry.","I m sure she has said something to this accord","Dr. [Removed] was encouraging us before taking our first exam, which for many of us it was our first ever college exam. This happened about a week and a half ago and I can just remember how nice it felt to be told by my professor that I was capable of doing great things and that I have the skills to succeed and do well on the exam.","Caudill makes sure no one feel like just because they aren't doing well in one part of the class, doesn't mean they will fail all of their plans for their future. She shows us that its ok to mess up, it will work out with a bit of extra help and work.","States how we can use our chemistry skills.","she said there are future doctors in the room type shi","She was nice.","Dr. [Removed] always encourages us that we can take charge of our own studying and create good outcomes for ourselves. She generally does this before or after an exam.","During the beginning of the term and after exams, Dr. [Removed] often gives us encouraging words that make us feel relieved and calmed to take the course. She often highlights her own experiences and provides us safety with knowing how the grading will work out in the end.","Talked about pre med and the futures that apply what we are learning.","With some topics, she would emphasize that this could be something with might see in the future related to our career choice and how it could impact us.","  At the beginning of class Dr. [Removed]   likes to give a run - through of announcements before lecture, as well as encourage students that we are making progress throughout the semester encouraging us that we are more than capable to make an impact in or future careers, mostly in the pre - health field. Before and after unit exams, Dr. [Removed] always informs us that the test does not define who we are, it just test how much information we we're able to retain.","Dr. [Removed] has frequently empowered us and reaffirmed us of the power of our knowledge.","We were finishing going over content for the next exam, and towards the end of class she reminded us that there is much more to life than our exam grade. We were encouraged to do well, but also not beat ourselves up if we don't end up with a desirable grade.","She would not directly say it, but she would imply it throughout the week and speak to us as if we were developing experts who would use the course material in our studies in the future.","She brings up things related to pre - med stuff which is helpful to them but annoying to me because I'm not pre - med but it's always assumed everyone is.","The instructor always made effort every class to be confident in ourselves and believed in our success.","Our instructor many times brings up students' potential future careers and reminds us that we are in a very good place, academically. She gives us a lot of hope for the future.","She was talking about whenever we come time for med school and things of that nature","During lecture, she would connect concepts we're learning to potential future careers we may intend to pursue. For example, when teaching the heat transfer equation she connected it for pre - med students, pointing out how it spelled out [Removed] ( helping us remember the concept and make connections to real life applications ).","Dr. [Removed] encourages students by explaining how we will eventually become someone impactful in this world.","Dr. [Removed] is always giving us positive feedback. She wants us to do good in her class and in the future, and speaks of the great things we can go on to do in the STEM world.","During the course Dr. [Removed] makes sure to uplift the students even during slumps. This happened a few weeks ago before a hard exam and definitely gave me a boost of courage.","Says this is the ground base for the future chemistry classes","The instructor is constantly reassuring the class when we seem confused or it's a hard concept which helps us know she does care and knows it is hard.","Although our teacher has never explicitly said so, she has said that we are fully capable of performing well in class and using the information and skills we garner to improve and use in future situations.","She told us what this part of knowledge will help us in the future","She mentioned this after we got our first exam grades back and we also have one next week so she has said it multiple times throughout this semester that the exam grades do not end your life and you will be okay after this class is over","Instructor has encouraged active participation in class. They have allowed students to independently think about concepts and apply them by themselves.","When we first joined the class and were being introduced to chemistry, our lead lecturer reassured the class that we're developing experts and it's ok if we don't understand everything immediately because she's here to help us with resources like the academic community. She also told us this class will prepare us for our future, especially for pre - med students, so paying attention is important.","The professor has always encouraged her students to work hard and succeed in her class to have a good foundation for chemistry. Her goal is for us to do well and prepare for organic chemistry next year. \n","She is encouraging and very helpful when it comes to making sure we do better and keeping us motivated.","As I said, I don't recall a specific instance.","Throughout the course, Dr. [Removed] is sure to give lots of announcements. While we are not necessarly referred to people, she does us tell about opportunities we can get involved with.","\n In our course, the instructor regularly emphasized our potential by referring to us as \" developing experts \" during group discussions and project presentations. This typically happened after we shared our insights or tackled challenging problems, reinforcing our contributions as meaningful. For example, our professor regularly reinforces the idea that we are learning everyday for a meaningful future.","At the very beginning of our course, my professor was sure to be as resourceful as possible because she knew our transition to college from high school would be difficult. She suggested we take time with the material and do our best if we hoped to pursue more science classes just for the fact that it is a fun topic to understand.","Whenever we would come across a certain topic, my professor would say that if we want to go into a certain field such as the medical field, knowing chemistry is very important. There s not a specific moment that I can recall, but she does bring it up every now and then.","She always mentions how we can accomplish something in the future regardless if its pre - med or a deifferent career path.","The professor would frequently allude to the fact that they were trying to make the course content as digestible as possible because she believes that we all have the potential to succeed and want's us all to understand the basics we need to achieve the goals we've set for ourselves.","She supports us and helps with our education","There are many difficult topics reviewed in the lectures for this course. While students can struggle to learn and retain information in these topics, the instructor always encourages us and explains that we can get it down if we keep reviewing and studying the concepts.","She once said that what we're learning is the foundation for more difficult chemistry courses.","She always refers to us in a positive manner and is always referencing our \" successful futures. \"","She would sometimes refer to how certain older students could accomplish certain things, which felt like a push of motivation for all the students. I don't remember the exact situation, but her talking about how students can accomplish things, definitely encourages the students.","She made sure to keep the class interesting","She doesn't say this actually. She usually sticks to the course material and small talk.","We were taking a quiz today and my teacher said that she doesn't want to see any wondering eyes because she hopes that the future doctors and scientists of our world don't need their peers for a quiz.","Our professor often spoke about all the different career paths that we students could take and always encouraged us to do so. This was usually tied into how the material learned in this course can be helpful beyond it as well.","i don't fully remember but maybe she said we have what it takes to motivate us","value our futures","He always says learn the material don't just memorize. He wants us to be experts on the material and not just pass the class.","During the beginning of the semester [Removed] mentioned the overview of [Removed] [Removed] and said that we are taking apart of the [Removed] [Removed] by researching of antibiotic activity in soil. Which in essence hints that we are taking apart of on going experiments that would be done by experts ( scientists ). This made us take the lab more seriously, I remember my lab partner was motivated by that explanation to find a good place to dig our soil to potentially find something that hasn't been found yet.","This directly relates to the goals of [Removed] [Removed] and what we are working to discover right now.","Dr. [Removed] and our TA [Removed] have really shown us the value of having good lab skills, which we will all need in the future with different labs. They show us we can be experts by asking us questions about our research and providing us with many different materials so we can really learn the science behind what we're doing.","I mean they never said we couldn't do anything meaningful. They foster a very positive environment that promotes hope for the future. In articles about the [Removed] [Removed] Project it makes it known that they want the students to maybe find a love for research so they can do something meaningful.","In this course, the instructor, encourages students to pursue research opportunities and offers resources. Through emails, our instructor is able to contact us.","In the course, the instructor often encouraged us to think about how our experiments could affect the real world. This usually happened during group discussions after lab work, where the instructor would say things like, \" You can really help with antibiotic discovery. \" This made us feel appreciated and inspired us to take our projects seriously, giving us a sense of purpose in our work. \n\n","The instructor always emphasized our importance in the [Removed] [Removed] study. He described how our research would benefit the cause and prove useful for our future careers.","It's usually in the beginning of class when she's passing out bags for our phones. We would line up by the door, and mention to her about upcoming exams, courses, and life updates. Her replies back are always so encouraging and helpful during these stressful times.","This was one of the first labs, where she told us all our reserch and data mattered, whether it was giving us the results we wanted or not.","when she first introduced us to tiny earth she refered to us as students helping a bigger cause.","This happened while the lab was occuring and they were explaining procedures that we are likely to encounter when we are in graduate or professional school which assumes we will be performing at a higher level in the future.","The instructor refers to students as developing experts who can accomplish something meaningful in the future by acknowledging the students capability to potentially combat the antibiotic crisis as part of the [Removed] project and research. I think this was clear from the first few prelabs.","When I was picking out which bacteria from each of the soil dilution plates that I should keep in a [Removed] plate, the instructor always asked our opinions before saying her own thoughts. The instructor allows us to make decisions as experts on what bacteria to keep as if we are scientists starting our own journey in discovering antibiotic - resistant or antibiotic - producing bacteria.","We are constantly reminded that our work can lead to the production of a novel antibiotic. Furthermore, we are referred to as developing experts as we slowly become more acquainted with the lab setting through practical experience.","Our instructor says we could potentially make discoveries that could help the world later on. What we learn in lab could be used in our careers and in other science research labs.","She related the experiments to our career paths. She was alwyas very impressed with our work","My TA is so positive and always encourages us. She also makes science so cool.","She always connects what we're going to something that can help us in the future and how our course is helping us accomplish our future goals. She's always connecting our course work towards a bigger picture","Throughout the semester, our instructor made it a point to emphasize the importance of the research we were doing in the lab despite the lab being an intro - level biology lab and the difference we can make with our research.","This was the first week of class, telling us that this work can be more meaningful than we think.","the whole tiny earth project really encouraged this","Our instructor is very motivational. She told us how this lab impacted her positively in her career and how she hopes to inspire us in our journey in science. She has made us feel capable and created a comfortable and safe lab environment. I really appreciate our instructor, [Removed], as she is one of few instructors that has made me, a minority student, feel as though I belong here and deserve the space I take in lab.","I can definitely see the results of accomplishing big things in the future from this class. There is so much lab focused materials that I feel like I could do this in a lab and replicate an experiment using the materials and procedures we did in lab.","My TA is very fun and helpful in the lab ; she looks at our samples and encourages and talks to us about our colonies and how they stand out. [Removed] also reminds us of how our research is really meaningful, and how we can contribute to real world findings.","The instructor has referred to students as being experts in anything and accomplishing something in the future with the work we do in the lab. The main goal of lab is to build experience for undergraduate students and for them to develop the skills necessary for them to succeed in science.","Using the [Removed] [Removed] idea, it is clearly motivating to think of ourselves as knowledgeable individual's that can truly impact science. This gives us hope of finding antibiotics and making an impact.","When looking at our bacteria last week, she said she hasn't seen anything like our sample before. She was excited about it and said it's a great research opportunity!","We would be referred to as researchers capable in making an impacts.","I recall at the beginning of this course, she talked about the benefits of a research course and how it could help us students in the future.","During lab, [Removed] would emphasize that the tiny earth project that we were doing could lead to new discoveries and how in the past students found a bacteria that is now being studied.","We see resources in pre lab and overview","The only time I can recall this happening is during the beginning of the semester and the TA was giving introductions and introducing herself and she applied how this bio is relevant to her studies here.","She talked about how this research helps [Removed] [Removed] find more antibiotics","I just remembered at the beginning of the class sawyer spoke about our potential and what we could do with the skills learned in this class.","N / A","Our instructor pointed out how the research we are doing could potentially lead to new discoveries.","Mrs. Hall has mentioned a few times that we are all learning how to work in a lab, for instance with streak isolations, and that she doesn't expect it to be perfect at first.   Additionally, with identifying cell morphologies, she said she understood that we aren't experts at this and to take a best guess.","Implied in the course based on our majors and interests.","This lab is constructed around the [Removed] [Removed] Project, where students perform research and take part in finding solutions to the worldwide [Removed] crisis. By performing experiments every day with soil isolates, students are one step closer to finding a solution.","She asked us to write a reflection on how college and the course will impact our future.","My professor has always encouraged us to ask questions and emphasized that we are learning content that can help us in our future!","When we learn something in genetics that can be applied to the real world, she mentions how we can use our knowledge in genetics to understand how diseases can be carried and inherited from certain generations.","Dr. [Removed] provides us with activities which cause us to reflect on our personal experiences In these activities, Dr. [Removed] allows us to write on what we want to accomplish in the future in our professional careers and she provides us with insight on how we are capable of accomplishing great things.","Dr. [Removed] pushes us as students. She always makes sure we can do the best in her class.","She made us write a reflection on our future plans","Dr. [Removed] always encourages us to keep trying because she knows we can improve. She often says that she knows some of us will go on to be doctors or researchers.","Our instructor has had us to multiple reflection activities while in class in order to understand what our goals are. Also, she has pushed us to understand our strengths and weaknesses in order to accomplish to our fullest potential.","Our teacher has told us during class when we do reflections for exit tickets that we can accomplish many things and do a lot with our lives.","Dr [Removed] is very encouraging, and sends out weekly [Removed] reminders that are motivational. She emphasizes the fact that her students are fully capable of learning even the challenging material in the course.","She always encourages participation in class discussions, telling us that it's okay to be wrong as that is what allows us to learn and grow. She also tells us to not be discouraged if we're struggling in the course as it means we are actually learning.","She always speaks about us with respect and hope for what we can accomplish in the future. She thinks of us as intelligent students.","I'm not sure if it is something that she explicitly said but it is just the vibe that she gives off in the classroom. She seems to be very welcoming towards all paths of life and very non - judgmental.","Dr. [Removed] holds high hopes for each and every student in her class not looking down at them at all and encouraging all sorts of collaboration and active learning. She refers to us as people with more than enough potential to achieve our dreams.","Dr. [Removed] has us write exit tickets which focus on how and why want to help others. She also encourages us to be great scientists","After the first mid - term, Dr. [Removed] told us to not feel discouraged by our performance. She emphasized the importance of learning and growing from our mistakes. She also has us do reflections in class, which encouraged us to think about the things that matter to us and what we want to do in the future.","It happened once towards the beginning of the course as an encouraging moment.","In the beginning of the course, she tried to empathize with us saying how even she didn't know things like deoxyribonucleic acids and said that it's ok for us to feel behind as long as we consistently study and come to lectures.","Always says we can do something even if it's hard","Instructor has included in discussion slides about what our aspirations are and given us hope that we will accomplish those goals","The instructor always affirms that the students are very intelligent. She never makes anyone feel incapable.","We wrote a reflection on how our college experience will prepare us for our future endevours","In lecture.","My instructor had us write reflections about our future and what we wanted to do.","Dr. [Removed] made us write down some sheets in reference to our future and what / how we would be able to use this course in preparation for our personal and professional lives.","Dr. [Removed] let us view ourselves as developing experts and people who can change the world.","She truly believes in us","Dr. [Removed] sees potential in each and every student and always encourages us during hard times. She is encouraging and truly wants us to succeed and dream big.","She is very encouraging, and always talks about growing as a person and a student. She also mentions our future in a positive light.","She constantly refers back to researchers who have created big names for themselves from the discovery of [Removed].","Dr. [Removed] told us that we can achieve anything we set our mind to accomplish. This includes doing biological research in evolution or ecology.","Dr. [Removed] encourages us to thing like professionals in the past month. The instructor told me to think like a professional.","Dr. [Removed] showed a movie clip in class about astronauts on one of the [Removed] missions after an exam. He emphasized that even though people make mistakes, it is just a small setback and you can still have a large impact in whatever you choose to do.","Our instructor has often said that anyone can learn physics and takes a growth mindset perspective, encouraging us to reflect on mistakes. He repeats this often and especially after things like tests.","Dr. [Removed] recognizing the difficulty of physics and the [Removed] of it and every day lives. Because of this, it helps me to feel that when difficult topics come up, and I took full courses later on in my academic career, that I will be prepared.","At the start of the semester he said anyone can learn physics and we could all be great physicist if we chose to. This was the first day of class.","In class, Dr. [Removed] likes to start off by giving us facts or news about the moon which allows students to gain an insight into a world outside of just physics.","Our professor focuses on the idea that just because we fail once, no matter big or small, it does not define us, and we can continue to learn and conquer the task. He did this after the first exam. Dr. [Removed] reminds us often that anyone can learn physics and to ask questions so that we can learn.","In lecture Dr. [Removed] has mentioned growth mindsets and how we can do better in the course, he hasn't necessarily talked about our \" futures \" \n","Dr. [Removed] is always helpful and wants us to succeed.","Dr. [Removed] talks a lot about maintaining a growth mindset, especially in the past week. He encourages students that having this mindset is extremely valuable and guides you to success in the future.","He encourages students after our exams during lecture","The instructor had shown us our grade average on midterm 2 and said that we can accomplish hard things. Dr. [Removed] said that to be a researcher, a physician, etc. we would need to apply ourselves to do hard things.","Dr. [Removed] will connect physics concepts and class to our life skills and will teach us life lessons.","When students were having hard time after taking Midterm 2, Dr. [Removed] used us as examples of future doctors. He stated that in order to cure things like cancer, we need to be ready to tackle things unfamiliar to us. This essentially motivated us to do better on Midterm 3.","When we did bad on the first exam, he said he would not give us a curve because that's not how real world works. For doctors researching cancer, they will not find the cure by getting curves and they have to work hard for what they are doing. Because of this, he made us take a half exam for half points back for exam 2","During class, we look at a lot of real life examples of how knowledge in physics can be applicable to complex real - world problems. For example, aviation and space travel.","Our professor has allowed us to complete reflection exercises to work on our own understanding of a positive growth mindset. He has taught us that we are in control of how well we perform in these classes if we work towards a better mindset.","Dr. [Removed] gives us real - life examples of physics in our everyday life. He shows us that it's all around us and how the things we learn can help us understand things better.","He basically just operates and speaks under the assumption that most of students are going into successful careers or graduate programs out of college, with most of the class being pre - health majors. There's no antagonism and he wants us to do well.","He told us that we can apply these facts to real life situations in and out of class, for example, the [Removed] 14 crew on the moon.","I can't remember exactly when this was said but he creates an environment with this mindset. He also talked about mistakes and how it's alright to make mistakes but we shouldn't internalize them because everyone makes mistakes. He wants us to learn and believes that we can do physics even when it is hard.","Emphasis on growth mindset. Dr. [Removed] talks about it often and encourages his students to really use it.","Dr. [Removed] talks to us about growth mindset and how going into healthcare requires that we have this mindset and also that we are able to apply things we learn conceptually.","Dr. [Removed] said how the concepts we are learning will be useful in medicine and for the [Removed].","They explain how important concepts are for the [Removed] and also future jobs as engineers, etc.","I can't remember an exact moment but he has mentioned throughout the semester that this class can be applied to many professions especially considering how many students our on different pre - health pathways.","Yes, the professor talks about positive mind set and how we should be hopeful for our improvement and use the meothids in the class to improve.","I forgot","Dr. [Removed] lectures biology and was going through what we might need to know for the future. This is when he brought up that since some of us will be doctors and will need to go to professional school, there will be some information that we should remember for the future.","Dr. [Removed] cares about his student's, their futures, and ultimately their success. He reminds the class that the exams are important, but do not define us. He also pushes students to challenge themselves and improve.","He asked how much of the class is currently on a pre medical track, and then stated how the content within the course can be useful and helpful in the long run, at the syllabus day.","Dr. [Removed] has mentioned before that those in class are future doctors, engineers, and researchers. He mentioned that we could also be scientists taught in school when teaching us about notable scientists.","I do not remember a specific time that Dr. [Removed]'s referred to us as \" developing experts who can accomplish something meaningful in the future \", however he does imply that his class will be beneficial to our future. He has acknowledged before that we will use his class to help us in our later classes and professionally in whatever occupation we pursue, so this supports our abilities to be successful in the future.","A lot of people like me did not do very well on the recent test, but the instructor had words of encouragement and told us \" if you knew everything, you would not be in this course \" which was really comforting. He offered people to reach out to him for help with the material to do better next time!","Last night he had a zoom call to [Removed] peoeple find [Removed] research opportunities.","He always reassures us that our exam grades do not define us and we just need to work harder and not give up.","Dr. [Removed] goes beyond what is regularly taught in comparing biology courses, as he believes that it can help us in proceeding classes. He explains how concepts we learn are not limited to this course specifically and will reoccur and can be applied to our future studies.","He reminds us that we need to learn and understand this information for our future careers, often times envisioning potential research or medical applications.","When describing what we could be using this knowledge more, he often mentioned the path for many in the class, the pre - med career, something many strive to do, although not me personally. He would make connections of what we needed to purse such goal. He would often relate current problems to what we could do to change it.","Constantly reassures students with positive words.","he has a lot of faith in his students.","I feel like the best example of this is the research opportunities that he helps freshman get.   He posts announcements and holds [Removed] calls to give advice for freshman trying to do reasearch.","He will sometimes say in lectures about the stuff we are learning is building us for the future and be helpful to our success.","Dr. [Removed] constantly discusses how important his teachings will be in medical school and in the future is you hope to go into healthcare/ any science career. He says this at least once a week by relating the concepts to other concepts we will learn in the distant future.","Our professor highlights that each of us have different educational backgrounds and futures. We are learning to apply these skills to our futures, even though they may be different.","The professor is always very respectful and positive, she supports through the use of a growth mindset and whenever we're stuck or struggling she treats it as an opportunity for us to improve and get better.","She has talked about how what we do in class will apply to our future careers on multiple occasions.","very good","Talks about what she does as a data scientist and the types of tools she uses.","He professor will ask us how we are doing with our projects and assignments and create drop in hours to help students and also give students motivation in class by making us understand the basics of coding and simplifying it.","Lots of good career advice and our project is like a career prep thing in a way","What she teaches us is importantly for analyzing data and visualizing it. She sees us as developing experts and allows us to grow in this class.","In the beginning of the course the professor gave examples of certain careers in which data science is useful.","[Removed] and every project given in class is in reference to the idea that one day we will be able to use this data positively, and actually become better thinkers.","She has mentioned before about careers in data analytics and how these skills can help you if that is the path you wish to take.","I vaguely remember professor [Removed] mentioning that programming is a completely trainable skill that anyone should be able to master and use as a professional.","The major project we've been working on throughout the semester has been repeatedly emphasized as excellent real - world problem experience that students can expects to face and have to tackle in related courses and jobs. The work is so relevant to future experiences that our professor recommends that we submit our work to data science project competitions and also consider the optional possibility that we present our work to the city of [Removed].","The teacher talks with us professionally and with repsect during class.","She teaches us as if we are all planning to be industry pros.","I believe in the first class she mentioned how R code could be a skill we can add to our resume.","She always relates her teachings to things we can do in the future with it.","She mentions us being pre meds and using this information for our future goals. She explains that statistics is important in all careers.","She always acts sure of our abilities and has little to no doubts about our accomplishments","Dr. [Removed] shows us how the data and R studio functions we learn in her class can be applied to outside and real world experiences. These can be used for meaningful projects.","I guess when she brings up real - life applications of what we can accomplish with what we are learning.","Never has Professor [Removed] made anyone feel like they wouldn't be able to go through this course successfully. She always reiterates the potentials students have to work hard and learn.","She tells us not to worry about current mistakes.","[Removed] is very encouraging toward our success in the class and mentions how it will translate towards whatever career we want","the instructor never really talked about career paths and such.but in discussion the TA was very comforting in talks about how our careers may flourish in different aspects as well as research","I think we were talking about why we were taking this course and ended up discussing the different pathways that the students were on.","Told us about all the different career paths ecology can encompass, this happened the first week of school. Mentioned that no matter what we feel about ecology, there is most likely a path or job that relates to things we enjoy.","Having a professor passionate about their work really encourages us to branch out into different fields of study. They have shared personal experiences of their own research in different fields and how it has being an meaningful experience for them and others.","The professor explained how understanding mathematical modeling and statistics is critical for research careers and how the process we use in class for making sense of models is transferrable to studying other ecological, mathematical models.","She gives encouraging words in addition to class material. This helps show how she believes in us.","She talks about us being able to do experiments in the field like the ones she shows us in class.","During the first few weeks of school when she described why we might be taking this course, and talked about future career options.","I'm not quite sure when she has said this in class.","After taking our first exam last week, the instructor made an effort to remind us that doing poorly on an exam does not indicate that we will not be successful in the future.","We were talking about a topic within the lecture and she mentioned that maybe one day we'll be able to solve that problem.","The professor always gives us resources to aid in our understanding in order for us to succeed in the future.","I can't remember an exact example, but she is very passionate about our success and speaks about how what we learn and who we connect with matters for the future.","professor helps explain how different curriculum especially when working with excel is helpful for the future.","The deadline for a group assignment was coming and Dr. [Removed] was reminding us that group assignments are part of what can help us develop collaborative skills that will help us accomplish bigger things in the fitire.","Our professor wants to motivate us throughout our time in class and sometimes brings up what we we want to be in the near future.","Dr. [Removed] announces opportunities for us to connect with other professors and peers as she believes one day we will be colleagues. She also lets us know that our grades are a way to learn from mistakes instead of feeling down for a poor grade.","She will give us her experiences about learning physics then connect it to our future","When she explains to us that knowledge is not finite. and we can always know more and get better at physics","Talks about future sometimes. Gives hope in studnets.","She always says we are the future of science and makes note that compared to when she was a student there are more women taking stem courses and that it's cool to see the future of science be so diverse.","She talked about physics being a possible field for all of us, this happens I think once a week. She just talked about her experiences and how it is possible for anyone.","During lectures, usually after telling a personal physics story, she'll encourage us by talking about a growth mindset and how we can succeed in the future if we believe that we can grow. However, she never exactly stated that we are \" developing experts who can accomplish something meaningful in the future \".","Always explains her experience as being an expert","Dr. [Removed] cares a lot about us. She always at the beginning of the class talks about how everyone can succeed in this physics class. Then shoe goes on to explain how everyone can succeed in this field of science. She talked about how everyone can do well and do amazing things in the future.","sHE ENCOURAGES STUDENTS TO BECOME FUTURE PHYSICTS WHO MAY ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING BIGGER AND [Removed] IN THE WORLD","She is always telling us about her own experiences and any failures that she has overcome to encourage us to continue, even when we want to quit.","The instructior constantly encourages students that phsyics is a learning process that with time and practice that many of us will become very skilled at physics.","The professor is always encouraging us and telling us that we will succeed. She is not really specific when she says that we will do something meaningful in the future but she does encourage us a lot.","She always giving advice on how failure is okay","He told the class that his grade for his first grad physics class as well as undergrad was around a 50 %. He then explained how it doesn't matter how we start out since we all grow to be able to accomplish anything","comments when the class performs well on [Removed] and on exams, encourages us by telling us his own journey with physics","He often brings up how he wasn't great at physics when he was an undergrad which I find really encouraging. He brought up a really low first exam grade in a physics class he took in college, but said he kept working to understand the material every week.","Mentioned a similar statement once, likely at the start of classes.","he gives us praise that we will become good workers in the future. he also encourages us to always keep trying","Often, our instructor would acknowledge most of our majors and identify topics commonly associated with them. Then, he would continue to do his best to explain the material and answer questions so people can understand what we learn and try to apply it to real - world problems.","Provide examples as to how what we are learning is applicable in research settings.","n / a","I think one time he might have mentioned something like that in class i don't remember the details","Professor [Removed] encourages students to attend office hours if they are performing poorly. He also allows for students to learn from each other in discussion sections","Dr. [Removed] has brought up a few times different job applications that physics has. There is no particular time or order he does this in, but more as a personal outstretch of his own knowledge to inform students of potential job opportunities, or at least the types of job opportunities. However, he does this infrequently.","I can't really remember a time where we were specifically referred to a developing expert who can accomplish something meaningful in the future. I do remember being referred multiple times to external sources that were interesting and sometimes unrelated to the specific topic we were learning, but very interesting nonetheless. He did this through prelectures or announcements shouting out those sources.","I think that the way in which our instructor replies to questions asked in class is whenever I have observed this. This is because the responses to the questions are usually followed by good comments regarding the question. I would also say that this occurs whenever he challenges us to ask questions.","Our instructor said that regardless of the grade that they may have started out with, anyone could have become a better physics student with a better future if they tried harder next time ; experts in physics who can get a meaningful grade / problem solving ability.","This was when our skills were complimented last week in lecture as far as the good skills that we had employed on the recent test.","every week in the class we have pre lectures for participation points. these pre lectures make us apply concepts to real life scenarios.","Our instructor usually asks how we are doing in other classes and what are intentions are for our future careers and what we will need to get there. She offers insight on resources on campus to develop our careers.","She is very supportive of the scientific imagination and uses it as something important to develop for your future jobs. She teaches a biology class so a lot of the students are pre - med meaning they will make a impact.","She mentions future biology courses ( like evolution or ecology ) and how that contributes to our development as scientists / thinking scientifically.","She will refer to researchers and professors that are working within our campus. This allows for people to go to them if that is a field they are interested working in.","When she speaks about our careers","She does this through encouraging us both personally and academically during lectures.","She connects the content in class to real world experiences","Dr. [Removed] always states how we can learn and how mistakes are part of the way to success.","Our professor often says that we are all from different fields and hope to pursue different things but still come together to become more knowledgeable in physics. She encourages us to keep trying and pick ourselves up if something goes wrong \n","During class she alludes to students being future professionals","The professor regularly refers to questions that may be on the [Removed] or other pre - health exams, and correlates ideas to things we would see as healthcare providers.","Dr. [Removed] is very positive and introduces physics in a positive light, as she wants all her students to succeed in her class. She always calls the students \" future doctors, \" which is motivating as I remember the purpose of the class and encourages me to learn. She always encourages us to ask questions and to reach out for help.","Before the lectures, he always encourages us. During the classes, he makes good jokes.","This idea is most prevalent when Dr. [Removed] discusses how we can all succeed if we put the work in for the course. He's constantly encouraging us to reassess our study strategies and to seek out help if needed, which I'd say is implying we can accomplish something meaningful in the future.","The atmosphere in the class is very motivating due to the fact that even though we may be struggling with another class, there is always someone there to help us. Our instructor is always encouraging us to keep going.","She believes we can do anything we set our mind to. She always validates our feelings.","She always encourages us by telling us how we are all scientists and how we all have worked hard to make it to where we are today.","When I had a meeting with her she referred me to the person in charge of the pharmacy program here.","Well [Removed] I don't rember but he makes connection of materials we learn to other classes were taking.","I don't think she used the term “ developing experts, ” but she's makes it clear that she's confident in our success. This is a message that she makes sure to get across as much as she can.","She provides us with many resources to better ourselves and relating to our futures.","This happened today in class when [Removed] was talking about our futures and what we want to pursue in.","In class today actually 11/19 we went over the different jobs and possibilities there are with a degree such as biology. I actually love the fact that [Removed] has had so many different careers to show how we can evolve and deviate from our path for the better.","Always encouraging us in what we want to do","In the first few days of class, he told us his story about how he became a professor and his research he currently does. He told us a lot of his struggles and experiences with this class and related it to us and showed how we could take what we learn find what we enjoy and then that into something.","The instructor shared their background experiences and compared his work to our future potential as engineers and scientists. This happened during syllabus week.","At the beginning of the class, he asked everyone what their majors are and what they want to do with that. After that, he looked at the responses and talked about how vast the different career paths are and how so many converge on these specific topics.","The professor often references the things that we students will be able to do with our lives after college, whether that be getting involved in research, as he has chosen to do, or following our own respective career paths.","If I remember correctly, in the beginning of the course he introduced the main topics we were going to cover. He also showed why we might learn these topics and how they apply to majors.","My professor takes the time before beginning the lesson to talk about experiences of her past students. She uses it to encourage us in our own abilities and help us find a sense of belonging in this course","She always put motivational slides at the beginning of each class to give us encouragement about what to do and how students in the past and struggled. She even details her own experiences.","Reminds us how this class is important even if it does not seem that way. Motivates us constantly.","Around the time the professor acknowledged our diverse academic backgrounds, she also implied that we would be able to move onto great things that didn't necessarily require [Removed] … i think","I don't remember","Ties information in to what our careers will be","“ If you want to do [Removed], if you want to do xyz, ” etc","This makes me feel good. To be told that I CAN do it. She encourages us to keep going and that feels good.","We were discussing time management several weeks ago. In this discussion, and the activity attached to it, we learned that the skills developed would extend past just college.","[Removed] sees us as awesome, high - achieving students. He has such high expectations of us, and he is always encouraging.","[Removed] always ensures that we can accomplish whatever we want in college, and in the future. He provides a great atmosphere and makes his students feel welcomed and comfortable.","I can't remember if they talked about this"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

So that was her way of encouraging students to consider different career.","She described her own career path, noting that her career trajectory chnaged many times until she found her calling.","the instructor discusses different opportunities in relation to chemistry and how to get involved with them.","She brought up pre health opportunities and encouraged those of us who were going into that field to look into a specific thing / concept we learned about in the lecture last week.","The instructor has not done this.","She talked about how she decided to minor in biology later in her college experience and how we could do the same thing if we end up changing our minds. Made sure we knew that that was perfectly okay.","She told us how her chem education has shaped her career and talked about her various pathways to educate us on our options in the future with this course.","Dr. [Removed] often refers to various opportunities around campus to help students branch out and consider future pursuits. For instance, she includes organizations geared towards pre - med students that would help students get to know about the profession.","Throughout lectures, my professor is very optimistic. She pushes us to go above and beyond.","She offers options to drop or add classes related to chemistry and makes sure students don't feel uncertain about their decision.","She mentions like how a specific topic will be beneficial for a particular field or etc.","Throughout her lectures, [Removed] mentions various ways that the chemistry we are currently learning can be applied to either future courses or careers.","Maybe becoming a science major on how passionate she is about it can make someone else be passionate and change their major.","The instructor covers many topics in the course. While learning she connects to many real life scenarios that the topics can be applied to. This helps the students to consider a range of career opportunities.","Our instructor has discussed how many of the people taking this course are some on sort of pre - health profession track, and she has mentioned some of the various options and how this course will benefit us in getting there.","For pre med students she told us about course registration and what classes we needed to take for it, including a new one for the pre health professions certificate.","I can't remember","I don't remember when, but she has mentioned students to consider field that go into chemistry. It has been briefly mentioned once or twice","Encouraged to study bio / chemistry and to take [Removed] ( next course in the sequence )","I think she mentioned how a lot of people are pre - med but mentioned how others also might not be and doing other things like engineering.","Encouraged different major / career options","Dr. [Removed] has told us about different careers she was in, and the careers one can get into with a degree in [Removed], or a background in [Removed].","She made concessions to how this course can be translated to other facets of education. This was done at the beginning of the year.","At the beginning of the semester, Dr. [Removed] addressed the class, emphasizing that she wanted the chemistry course to be beneficial for everyone, regardless of whether they were chemistry majors. She expressed this by saying something like, \" I hope this course helps you see the various paths you can take, whether in chemistry or any other field, and understand how the skills you learn here are applicable across different careers, \" which made the class feel more inclusive.","On the first day of class, the professor mentioned to us that chemistry was just a step in the direction we might want to take. It was mentioned that we can do whatever we put our minds to and that chemistry branches off into many career paths that we can possibly take.","The instructor mentioned how specific content in the course can be used in a variety of fields apart from just medicine. Displaying the applicability of the content while simultaneously encouraging diverse interests in the students.","She told us at the beginning of the semester to keep an open mind to our career path and that chemistry was an interesting path we might become intrigued in after the semester.","She always says that pre med isn't the only thing we can do with a science degree and that there are other opportunities too. This is good for the students who aren't pre med or want to drop pre med.","A while ago, Dr. [Removed] encouraged students to consider different pathways in science. She explained how students can participate in advanced research, enter the medical field, or other science - related career paths.","After the first midterm she told students that they can retake 2 of their worse midterms. Congratulated those who did well and let people know that their grade isn't final.","Roughly near the beginning of the semester, our instructor talked about going into medicine, or any other field in STEM and talked about the many different career paths we can go into. She also brought up some programs specifically for students going on the pre - med track","She spoke about how many students from different majors come to take the class and that you could learn about other paths from eachother","I have not had an experience when the instructor encourages us","She talked about how one could apply the information from this course into other courses and talked about how someone could take a course that was more interesting to them based on what they learned. She also once talked about how a minor can prepare you more for possible opportunities in the future.","I don't remember this happening.","She often talks of chemistry application in research and health related careers.","Our professor told us about the opportunities available to people seeking different career fields.","Well, she sometimes has different fields that need chemistry. Also how the stuff we are learning now can be used in the future.","[Removed] has mentioned briefly about different paths that is possible in the realm of chemistry. Which leads to students taking interests and asking questions.","In class, she talked about it","She mentioned multiple TA opportunities that would be provided in the future for those who would like to do that in the future, also about what premed fields would benefit from the chem classes.

I accidentally clicked the button and I can not go back","I can't remember a time this has happened.","Dr. [Removed] lightly mentioned how one class can spark an interest in us in something we might have never before considered.","Tells us it's okay to not be great at chem and that it's okay to change course.","My instructor has done this because I feel as though she really highlighted that there are various pre med, pre [Removed], pre [Removed], etc tracks you can take for your future. She manages to bring in content from our chem 301 class and explicitly states whether or not one thing or another is truly needed for a certain pre - health track.","Dr. [Removed] is very encouraging and she makes sure that we are aware of our options.","When she would encourage us to consider various career paths, we were talking about the necessity of chemistry in Pre - [Removed] occupations. We were told about how we would also utilize the knowledge in this course in future courses, but we do not go in - depth about the importance of this course in our future professions.","She just brought up the fact that most of the things we learn in class are applicable to other fields so it would be wise to learn the material correctly. \n","Dr. [Removed] encouraged us to consider different career paths, especially within a specific field. For example, in engineering, students can go into biomedicine, biochemistry, and so on, and that what we learn in class can benefit a bunch of different career paths.","Before we take quizzes or exams, the instructor assures us that we will be okay, as she knows we are capable of doing well.

That makes me think about possible careers in research.","N / a","In one of our class sessions, the instructor facilitated a discussion on various career paths related to our coursework by inviting guest speakers from different fields. They encouraged us to think about how our skills could translate into various roles, saying, \" Your education opens many doors — let's explore how each of you can find a path that resonates with your interests and strengths. \" This approach not only broadened our perspectives on potential careers but also sparked engaging conversations about our future goals.","When she first introduced herself, she said her career and daughter's path, and let the TAs introduce themselves. They all had different career paths.","At the beginning of the lab, we talked about the goals of the lab and introduction to what this lab class would be like. The instructor emphasized how this opportunity could help you better understand what your future career could be like in the research industry.","I do not remember","I don't think it has been exactly telling us that there are various other options to pursue for a career, but more that we are introduced to many options. Obviously we are introduced to research through the lab, but a lot of outside assignments introduce us to other plausible options.","I just remember during our first week of lab she mentioned her past and was talking about different career paths biology research can take you. She also gave details about what she has accomplished.","very positive","I think that she said we could potentially do more research on antibiotics, this introductory lab gave us a good foundation with a research purpose on what a real laboratory project would be like.","The instructor has always encouraged us to do our best and has always been encouraging when talking to us about our future plans.","I don't believe this has necessarily happened but she always reminds us to ask her any questions and is willing to give us advice","I believe that when she first introduced herself, she talked about how there are different career paths for everyone. She said to be open - minded and take challenges.","I think this one is mainly implied, as if you like the research aspect of the class then you will be more inclined to wanting to continue down this path. I ve often heard people ask the instructors how to apply for their certain position, etc, showing new interest in lab directing.","Although she doesn't directly state it, she is highly encouraging and motivates us to work hard toward our goals for the future","From taking genetics, we can pursue different career paths based on the knowledge we gain in this class. Our Professor is very supportive of us students and wants us to do well and pursue what we are passionate in.","Genetics has various pre - med students, so Dr. [Removed] does often speak about that and how this course is an important stepping stone to that. Therefore, when learning about cystic fibrosis, for example, she ties it back to how if you go into research you could help research a specific gene of that.","My professor uses real world examples when explaining things and encourages others to enforce change.","During lecture, we were discussing the things like protein and chemical pathways, and Dr. [Removed] briefly mentioned how we could be pre - med or pre - research ( etc.. ) if we wanted to learn more in depth.","The professor showed us examples of researchers who study the same stuff we went over in class, letting us know of the feasibility research career paths can have.","[Removed] [Removed] has various reflection prompts in which we think about this question. I love how it is anonymous and low effort which really encourages us to think in a thoughtful way.","Dr. [Removed] posts weekly announcements encouraging us to get to different events on campus. One week I attended a research lab seminar that was recommended by Dr. [Removed], and was able to explore more career paths through that.","She asks us what we're interested in and wants to know about our values. She tells us how smart we are and builds our confidence as well.","She doesn't directly encourage us to consider different career paths, but she always provides us with resources to various opportunities on campus. These opportunities often introduce us to new specialties and areas of study.","Sometimes in class Professor [Removed] will mention how genetics can tie into research, technology or medicine. She provides weekly / daily updates with seminars we can attend that cover various fields related to biology and different research opportunities.","she makes us keep all options open which is very enlightening","Sometime, she would send out announcements with different opportunities that students can take.

She often informs us about certain jobs that analyze the material that we learn in class.","She asks why were taking the class, and what we plan to do with it.","In all of our homework, we can make a real - world connection to our learning from this concept taught during that week. She often explains how processes are done in labwork as well.","She talks about how you can explore research, pre - med, or even other health career oriented careers.","During lecture Dr. [Removed] will briefly mention the professional applications of a concept or slide she is presenting. For instance, during the [Removed] module she mentioned how a lab researcher would use this method to identify sequences in a protein / gene.","Professor occasionally send an announcement about career spotlights or symposiums related to genetics / biotechnology. She encourages us to attend or take a look at those events.","The professor has never done this.","The instructor is a very kind person and encourages us greatly","Dr. [Removed] always mentions that physics can tie into a lot of the biological sciences that his students are taking, and that physics is a lot more involved in that than we'd think. He encourages us to open our minds to physics and its influence.","I don't think this has happened","I don't specifically remember Dr. [Removed] saying something like this, however I do not think this is an important thing to talk about in a physics course.","We cover a lot of different real world applications to the study of physics in the class and he encourages us to consider the wide range of possibilities both in terms of examples and how we problem solve in life. This happens regularly in class and it makes us feel confident and curious about the other possibilities of thinking and solving.","I don't recollect if Dr. [Removed] specifically said different career paths, but I think he did mention how physics would be applicable in alll life sciences.","He shared personal experiences throughout the first week of lectures, emphasizing the value of knowledge and cultural sensitivity as well as the acceptance of exploring alternative job paths as one goes through life.","Encouraged us learning physics","He always talks about the moon tbh","Gives ootions","At the beginning of the course, we talked about physics and how it connects to space.","different career paths is to provide them with information about various career options","Yes, he voiced it during class about how what we learn and how we learn will apply to future professions","During lectures, he suggests different oaths if interested in learning more about biology or other science fields.","On the first few weeks of school, the professor posted a question on [Removed] asking why students were taking the class and what profession they were considering. He openly expressed that there are many career options available with an understanding in [Removed].","Dr. [Removed] made us consider multiple career options and study abroad opportunities last month. He said that it would be beneficial for us to gain international experience.","While explaining some material concepts required for the course, he goes into the aspect of very unique important career paths with these concepts. He encourages students to look into these paths as it could be a passion, but he doesn't force ideas onto students.","During lecture, Dr. [Removed] emphasized the importance of understanding content rather than memorizing it. H stated that if we are ready to open our minds and truly try to learn, then we are also capable of considering different career paths and creating different goals, no matter the difficulty.","I don't remember","He has talked about researching and pre med and lots of opportunities.","The professor discussed the majority of students are pre - med in the course I am taking. The instructor said this is admirable, but many options are open to people with a degree in [Removed].

He stresses that there are plenty career options that can be performed with a CNS degree.","Dr. [Removed] is aware that some students in his class are on the Pre - Medical track, but he also hopes to inspire others to consider biology as a career. He does not discriminate his teachings to any one interest section of the class, he caters to all his students.","I can't remember a specific instance but there has definitely been times during our lectures especially during the first unit when Dr. [Removed] would refer to how this course would be beneficial to us even after undergrad as most of us are Pre - Med students. He's talked about different professions within Pre - [Removed] and how biology applies to those.","In the [Removed] 311C course, within the first month, Dr. [Removed] introduced a biotech study abroad opportunity. This was meant to encourage us to think about careers that could combine biology with global experiences. He highlighted that \" these opportunities can open doors to unique career paths and help you gain perspectives in biotechnology, \" which made me consider how a study abroad would be super beneficial to my career path. \n\n\n\n\n\n","Dr. [Removed] will give tips about studying habits and career pathways before class sometimes","The professor explained health career paths as well as research. He talked about it in the first few weeks of school.","The professor definitely encourages students on their \" pre - med \" or whatever other journey they me be on. He emphasizes the foundations that this course teaches us.","The instructor would mention the high demand for data science in all industries during the beginning portion of class.

There is still time to change paths.","Dr. [Removed] has discussed different career options that work with statistics.","I don't exactly remember specific moments, but Dr. [Removed] often praises other disciplines in biology and ties back a lot of ecological foundations to evolution or genetics.","During the first week of the course, the [Removed] spoke about many different career options that are related to [Removed].","In our first discussion, our activity was to explore different career options that are related to ecology. We read different articles on career paths and shared what we found interesting with our group mates.","In the beginning of the year the instructor described different research she conducted and how her knowledge of ecology contributed to this.","The instructor went into detail about the professions one can go into with knowledge in ecology. They described the market for each profession and what they entail.","Many majors that have to take ecology have a career in mind involving something related to research, and with the amount of research we cover for each topic, those who conduct it and their methods can come up as a topic of discussion. In this way, the professor says \" if you are a researcher in this situation, you should do this \" or \" You would be dealing with things like this under this field of research. \"","During the first week we looked at different careers available for those interested in ecology","N / A","Had a discussion section on jobs in ecology.","Maybe in passing, but I can't remember a specific example.","She's mentioned her experiences with such a topic and how she originally didn't consider to be a professor, however, here she is! This is something that's good to hear to keep your options open and allow your life to place you where you belong, not necessarily where you always want to go at first thought.","During class, she stated how physics sometimes is struggling and she has had times where she wanted to cry but she got through it, and even through it is hard you can create different career paths out of it. I found this very helpful to hear her struggles and how she got through them.","Professor [Removed] uses problems that apply to real life and make us start thinking about how these situations apply to concepts outside the classroom","She tells us during lecture to be open to different career paths, especially if we find physics interesting because it is a field for everyone.","She made sure we understood the implications of physics","Dr. [Removed] tells us to always find a field that we are comfortable and confident in, so it wasn't so much that she was outwardly telling us to choose different career paths, more so that she wanted us to keep an open mind about our futures. I think this approach is much easier on students in STEM.","Our instructor has told us that we should be open to all different career paths. Even if you think you are bad at something, you might discover you enjoy it and want to do it.","an in class example of using a syringe to figure out pressure last week ( 10/31 ). the instructor asked people whether they were going into the health care field and applied an in class problem.","This happened in class. She basically told us to cast as wide of a net as possible and soak in all that interests us.","Dr. [Removed] has talked about her students pursuing a career in physics. She has said many times that physics can be for anyone and you do not have to be a genius to pursue this career path.","She tells us that anyone could work in physics if they work hard.","Dr. [Removed] would advise us to keep an open mind with what we decide to do with our future when she would ask us how we are doing in the beginning of each class.","She definitely is very happy about physics and always tells us stories of stuff that she and others she knows have done within a physics career, despite knowing that many of us are wanting to go into other field. She is encouraging us to keep the door open for other pathways","He would say that he wasn't good at physcis but ended up doing it","The instructor during lectures mentioned his path in college and how they ended up on a career path they didn't think they would take when entering college, and also talked about imposter syndrome in college and how that can carry over to career so don't let it discourage you from trying different career paths and try different things till you discover what you like.","He talked about different career paths that he considered and how he ended up in physics. He encouraged us to explore and to not be closed minded. He talked about how he changed his minds and how he ended up becoming a physics professor.","The professor considers the various majors that take his class and how the class may benefit their specific career.","The instructor spoke about his passion for physics and his hopes that he could encourage a few of us to pursue it further. This happened during lecture at the beginning of the semester.","The first day Dr. [Removed] had us answer a few questions on a notecard. One of which asked, \" Why are you in this class? \" Students had varying answers in terms of their career choices, and he let us know this was a very diverse course for differing majors.","I don't think he has done this I just can't go back and click no.","Professor [Removed] has used his personal experiences to help provide information about different careers. For instance, he has spoken about his background in particle physics and the lectures he provides in different parts of the country, which many students may find interesting.","all good","The instructor perused through various career paths including engineering, physics research, or otherwise. This was sometime at the start of the semester.","Dr. [Removed] includes a final slide at the end of every lecture with more information about the topic. She references professors who research the lecture topic and links their websites on the slide, encourages interested students to reach out to these professors, and is a very good arbiter between them.","She thinks that s vital for students","She will talk about a topic in class and then say something like “ You would need to know this in such course but if not then you won't go too into detail about it. ” I personally appreciate this because it lets me know if I need to take it into account or not.","Tells students how they belong both at [Removed] and in science at [Removed]!","Dr. G sends out canvas announcements about a wide variety of opportunities that have to do with different career paths. She also relates biology [Removed] to different paths.","I can not remember an exact example","Dr. [Removed] mentions our futures often and suggests how physics may relate to our prospective careers.","Can't exactly recall but she always mentions the different fields physics is relevant to.","The instructor always eats us know if the many different career paths available to us within [Removed] and the resources provided to us by the university. She even mentioned to us that experiment with our interests and gain knowledge from different professions.","We were going over possibly changing majors and the process that goes with it. She emphasized that we must envision other paths we may take.","When she went over a slideshow giving information about pathways she spoke on how she had to help another student change their school. Instead of saying he should have stayed, she spoke on how it is good to do what you want.","Today, we talked about possible career options and switching majors","Lecturer had a seminar focused on different career paths. TA mentioned how it's fine to keep changing majors and mentions how medical schools like seeing gap years or 5th years.","Again, today she talked to us about exploring many types of career opportunities, as life is about “ experiences ” and not exactly just the major or education you receive.","Galitzki talked about the different careers and locations he has worked in. Including how he used to work in [Removed] which was really cool to hear about.","Shares his work about his research and astronomy before every class to grow interest in people.","I vaguely remember a day in which our professor posted an online poll in class so that he could gauge which majors he was teaching. He also included a poll question that asked us for our current career path, and once he had the answers, he discussed them briefly with us.","When Professor [Removed] talked about how he worked on a telescope in [Removed] I m pretty sure I remember him expressing how he never thought he would do that in his life and that your career can take you to unexpected places. Even after talking about how he became a teacher and researcher at [Removed] it just kind of showed me that anything can happen in the future after college.","In class","Instructor talked about his career, and how us, students, could pursue similar careers if we wanted. This was during syllabus week.","Before each class, through the reflections written by former students, the professor gives us enough opportunities and possibilities to think about different future careers, which is very helpful to everyone.","Professor [Removed] does not force a career in physics on her students. She understand we each have our own interests and encourages us to incorporate them within the class.","She has specifically stated that taking this class doesn't mean you have to become a physics major. Or even continue down that path in the future. She is very good with understanding the students and what they may want.","Our instructor encouraged us to explore different career plans and degree options. This included finding the difference between a [Removed], [Removed], and [Removed]","He asks us to consider what we would be interested in if it isn't our major","They tell us to consider how all the different paths we may relate to the course material. This is done to suggest that the course material has relevance to any person regardless of gender, ethnicity, background, etc. as we can all learn more about education by examining how the education system can be refined.","Our instructor is able to show us the paths we may take as first year college students. She understands that not everything will go so well for everyone so she encourages us to consider other options.","It is very good to think about all the possibilities of jobs and take chances so you truly know what you know."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

She shared personal experiences about how the subject had impacted their own career and encouraged us to think beyond just passing the class.","She would say that this content will be used for the rest of my career in medical field.","She talks about the importance of hard work and how important it is for the future.","Dr. [Removed] helps students make connections between the course and later accomplishments in life because she often mentions different career paths and the connection that chemistry has to them at least once a week. For example, she connects general chemistry to achieving success in future chemistry classes and the pre - health field.","She mentioned how one of the topics was relevant to the medical field and is used in medical practice.","We were talking about a concert. She said it would be interesting and useful to pre - med students","My instructor talked about the practical applications of learning about quantum mechanics not only later in the course, but also in later courses and our possible career paths depending on our major","At the very beginning of the semester, the professor made connections between the material we could cover in class and how that could be applied to engineering, jobs in the medical field, etc.","Professor teaches really well. I hope to be a chemist because of her","My instructor has made it known where to look for help and who to go to. She does this every class.","Dr. [Removed] has provided us with real life examples of elements and shown us how they react. Demonstrating us with an experiment with blowing us ballon filled with certain elements to correlate with what she was teaching us.","My professor encourages students in all types of majors. A few weeks ago, she ensured us that we will all be successful in the future.","Dr. [Removed] often expands on certain topics to show what we will need in further classes or what specific majors may want to prepare for. She draws connections between certain chemistry topics prepare biologists or those in the medical field.","At the beginning of the course, the teacher talked about how this class could help students in the future. She described the importance of STEM and learning.","Whenever we get into certain topics, she'll make the connection to pre - health students, which I am. She will mention how this would benefit me to know an understand now as I'll end up using it as a foundation.","Dr. [Removed] always tells us to not stress too much over this course and the material because in the end, it will all work out. This helps a lot of students relax and focus during class rather than worrying about the next grade. She says this before exams and makes sure to reassure all her students thatt they are going to do great.","The professor emphasized the importance of learning and understanding chemistry.","Tsfsajopasrbjiosbojgr","Gave examples on what we could use chemistry for what we want to do in the future in class and how it applies to many jobs","Every few lectures, the professor includes examples of common things happening around us, so one of those things can certainly influence what students. I think she has also mentioned using same principles in particular jobs.","This happened when she was explaining the compounds of molecules that could be used down the road if you were in a pre - med track. We were studying formal charge and bonding. Dr. [Removed] said \" those of y all in pre - med will see these compounds later on down the road \"","Although a base course, [Removed] 301 is taken by people from different majors and schools. She often would relate these topics to other subjects like physics or engineering.","Connecting STEM courses to real life and understanding how to practically apply our coursework in future academic scenarios have always been very helpful for me.","This course is very helpful when moving on in any science degree or path. This intro chem class is the foundation of science, and the content is very important and interesting.","connect course material to how it could be applied briefly.","I would say overall in this course we talk about ways to succeed and taking away info in this class for future goals they might want to accomplish. I would say about once or twice every 2 weeks we kind of come back to this if we have more time in class and aren't rushed.","N / a ( clicked by mistake )","This hasn't happened in the past week, but she does tell us about what we would need for chemistry two if we want to continue, she occasionally does this","Applied this course to other topics in other fields. Like atomic theory to physics and quantum mechanics","Lots of times she talks about real life examples of how chemistry can help you. One time she talked about coking, another time she talked about buisness","The professor did some experiments that show the real - world application of the concepts we are learning about in class. This has shown me how the information we are being taught has a broader application and can be applied to my future aspirations.","Our instructor is very thoughtful and kind, she truly cares.","Dr. [Removed] helps her students make connections between [Removed] 301 and our goals in life by providing a grading system that caters to only wanting the best for a student's academic success regardless of their extenuating/ personal circumstances. She understands that we have ups and downs and allows room for those to occur as we are taking her course. Moreover, Dr. [Removed] tells us that it's okay to make mistakes and while its hard at first we will persevere through it by working hard.","Our professor talked to us about different careers and other majors that we can go into. They also went over specific skills we can also try and develop in order to succeed","She made an effort to know who was majoring in what and get a clear idea of where everyone was going. She then made a personal anecdote about her life and how she ended up with chemistry.","The professor basically told us that if we want to pursue medical jobs then chemistry will be helpful. They explained that the fundamental knowledge built in this class will be the building blocks for our future careers.","We were discussing something and our instructor told us how this can benefit med students when taking the [Removed] and compared studying strategies for her class to those for the [Removed]","Dr. [Removed] mentioned chemistry is one of the core courses for pre health pathways and said this course will be crucial for students who are planning to go through the pre health paths","we were learning about a specific compound ( nitric oxide ) and she related it to the healthcare field because it widely used there. This happened during the last lecture. She encouraged students to look into it if they're interested.","My professor has mentioned when covering certain topics, such as bonding, that they will come up again in people's educations and career if they are pre - health.","Professor [Removed] occasionally refers to important things to learn from the material that is important to the Pre - Med track. I can't remember a specific instance or what happened before or after, but I'm sure it happened.","I think, one day, Dr. [Removed] talked to us about how we could use whatever we were learning about ( I don't remember ) and take it for organic chemistry. It never really has gotten to life yet.","Our teacher mentioned that if we were on a pre - med track, we would need to know the specific concept of resonance structures later on. Her mentioning that concept now, although she didn't go into too much detail, helped me know what to grasp for future classes on the pre - med track.","Dr. [Removed] has talked about how there are so many unique fields of work available for someone that has studied / researched chemistry and how there will always be an option for us to do something in the future with our majors.","During lectures, Dr [Removed] spoke about how we can apply chemistry to real life. These connections to real life can reflect what we, as students, hope to do in life.","Professor [Removed] often connects the basic concepts we learn to more complicated ones that progress in higher areas of learning and employment.","The instructor made connections between how chemistry will be present in our biology journey.","There would be random times she adds comments to her teaching talking about how the equation, or how the question is formed comes from a real life scenario and likes to comment that she might not know what we want to do, but if we are going into STEM or medical school, we will be expected to know or it'll be helpful to get some exposure for experience.","Content material is structured timely and reviewed as needed with every unit. The learning modules help significantly and capture how the information can be used in the future.","[Removed] helped make lots of connections. It helped us understand the entire course. It makes the course easier.","[Removed] tells us which unit will help with certain courses in the future and why certain topics are important for certain careers every week.","The instructor was teaching thermodynamics. She highlighted how what we learn now will be used in higher courses.","The professor once a week approximately emphasizes how the content of her class will be applied on our lives in the future based on the careers we want to achieve one day. For example, one time she made a connection between a concept that will be used in biochemistry and in the medical field.","As mentioned a few questions ago, Dr. [Removed] begins each class with an announcements slide, and she will occasionally relate the course to our future careers.","I can't think of specific instances because they're mostly comments here or there that spark it, but Prof. [Removed] does reference what we learn in conjunction with career pathways such as engineering, medicine, and research. Especially now that we're studying thermodynamics, which is a subject that is important in future classes, she has mentioned this.","In our [Removed] class, Prof. [Removed] makes a point of showing how what we're learning connects to real - life issues, like how thermodynamics plays into energy conservation or how reaction rates matter in environmental science. She does this throughout the course, especially when we start new topics. She'll say things like, “ Think about how this concept shows up in things like battery tech or even climate change, ” which really helps us see how chemistry could be useful in our careers and everyday lives.","She briefly mentions how some of the concepts can be applicable in real world situations.","I don't really know any.","The instructor has referred to real life concepts on the basis of chemistry. She's also pointed out which concepts are important for future careers in the medical / research field.","This statement was said in the beginning of the school year. Dr. [Removed] emphasized the importance in basic chemistry and how some units will stick with us in future courses.","The professor gives us various ways that this course can connect with out major or goal after college. The professor also recommends us further chemistry classes that can achieve the same goal.","She tries to remind us that this course is the base to all upper - division scientific classes and future scientific careers.","Refers to concepts that may be useful in the future such as [Removed] [Removed] and medical school.","Dr. [Removed] will always make connections to our potential careers in the future because most people in the class are on some kind of pre - health path. She will always make reference to how this course is very important to our careers.","She talks about the future careers in the STEM majors. She has done this verbally.","The happened not very long ago. The professor stated that chem was important for many future careers and that it was very useful especially for medical careers.","Dr [Removed] has linked concepts we're currently learning to future concepts that could come up in more advanced chemistry courses, or to the types of real world applications they have. I am not a pre - med student, but most of the things she mentions are relevant to pre - med coursework.","Occasionally after a new concept was introduced in class the instructor would touch on practical usages of the concepts and how they can be applied in real life.","My professor never really connected chemistry to real life, but I do believe that had more to do with chemistry and not my professor.","The instructor has connected how the course connected to their own life in their own jobs outside of teaching. They did this on the first day of class.","State things being taught that will apply to later careers. This happens in class","I think that the connections you make in this course can set the ground work for future classes that you take and can help you in your career with a basic knowledge of chemistry.","Caudill in a recent lecture I forgot what day but within this month introduced us to another course that could benefit us for the future depending what we wanna be.","Again I do not know if this happened. She is encouraging and talks about future chemistry courses but that is all she can really do in the context of our class.","I met some very nice girls coming into this class, and now we see each other before class and study together. She would encourage us to speak to each other before class.","The instructor showed how concepts apply in real life by referencing careers or tasks.","Dr. [Removed] often uses real world examples to connect topics in the course to things that students hope to accomplish in life. This includes research application, medicinal application, and generally the way the world functions due to chemistry. This happens often throughout the semester.","The course is mainly for students who are majoring in natural science or engineering ; however, the instructor makes this course easy to understand and fun for students other than STEM majors.","Dr. [Removed] always tells us how the material we are learning in class can be assigned to topics for careers in the future. This happens at least once a week in class.","Occasionally, we will have demonstrations done in the class that show real life application of the content that we're learning. She doesn't do it enough times for it to assess everything we learn, but we do it sometimes.","The instructor pointed out the applications of thermodynamics to physics. This applies to engineering.","N / a","The course outline is a way to keep students interested in STEM fields by giving them research experience. It also allows students to see other fields of STEM that they may want to pursue.","This happens nearly every day because my TA always connects what we are doing to the real world. I feel like a lot of us want to make a difference in the lives of others, and we are reminded that our research has the potential to help people.","By participating in ethical discussions regarding the field of biology and research, I am learning how to make connections between what we learn in lab and how I can apply it in my future, as well as apply it to the discussions we have. Our ethical discussions occur every week, with one assignment that encourages all students to collaborate in a meaningful discussion and express our views on real world issues. The instructor provides us with the content, and as a class, we discuss the content.","I can not remember an exact time this happened.","At the beginning of the semester, we looked into the [Removed] [Removed] Network which focuses on giving students an active - based learning experience to inspire them to continue pursuing a career in science.","She has explained how the procedures are similar or different to other procedures done in other labs outside of this course.","This did not happen","She would show how these soil bacteria may be a new antibiotic if they have rings of inhibition. She showed how this was applicable as she told us that there was an antibiotic resistance problem and to combat it, we needed new antibiotics.","This has happened when discussing how important the research we do is, even when the results are not what we expected.","I don't remember","She was very passionate about this course and it reflected on her students too","We learned about how learning lab procedures is important for our future, whether it is to do research, for medical school, etc as it helps us become better learners.","[Removed] has provided examples of how the things we do in the lab is standard lab practices for biology labs in the future, even for professionals.","Since this whole course is about benefiting society by potentially producing antibiotics, quite often do I hear that the things we do will help us in the future. Since I am on the pre - med track, I can relate to this. I see these on emails and weekly assignment information.","Just when we were discussing the process of spreading the solution on [Removed] plates, my TA said that this can be important if we want to do more research in the future.","Students in [Removed] lab generally want to pursue some type of STEM career path and many specifically want to go to med school or science research. This lab teaches a lot of base knowledge of lab techniques that will be used in future labs. Also the background knowledge is useful for future biology / medical students.","Because it is lab and we are so close together with our groups I get to learn so much from each of my group members as well as share my knowledge that I have.","Providing is the opportunity to explore the [Removed] center.","What happened and when : We were performing [Removed] and she told us that it would benefit us in future lab - related endeavors because it looks good when you already know how to perform a [Removed].","The instructor helps us develop our microscope and pipetting skills, which are all things we are going to have to know in the future because most of us want to go into healthcare. \n","Mentioned new discoveries","The instructor has elaborated how the different procedures we learned and practice in lab could help us in the future. For example, when we learned about [Removed], she said that it was an important skill to learn because research labs would be more likely to select a candidate that knows how to perform a [Removed].","Sometimes [Removed] mentions how the tests and experiments that we carry out in the lab can also be helpful in our future medical or research careers. Most of the students, if not all, are wanting to be in a STEM career path, so this course is like an intro to laboratory techniques ( especially when we learned aseptic techniques ).","She has told us how we can use the techniques we have learned in other labs","Dr. [Removed] always provides articles about genetic breakthroughs in research and provides examples of the importance of genetics in the real world. In the homework problems, she always encourages students to reflect on how they can apply the concepts learned to their daily lives. \n\n Also, Dr. [Removed] often starts off the class with philosophical quotes about life and learning before her lecture, which I find very lovely.","At the end of each homework assignment ( once a week ), we are given a reflection question and one thing you can talk about is drawing connections between what was learned that week and how it will help you accomplish something in the future.","She constantly makes a connection between this course and the things they hope to accomplish in life. She will give us examples of what career options are there.","Just this past week we completed an exit ticket where we reflected on the things we want to do with our lives in the future and thought about what we've been learning through our time at [Removed] and how to two things connect.","For each module Dr. [Removed] provides an article that links what we've learned in class with real life scenarios. Moreover, she often provides links to different seminars relating to genetics and other backgrounds that students can attend. She often connects these resources to different career paths, but it's ultimately up to the student to pursue a deeper understanding of the connection.","This happens in some classes where in the first slides she explains somethings an how they relate to certain fields. This, then, connects the instructor with future careers that people can pursue.","Dr. [Removed] made students to write exit tickets that relate genetics with their future career.","Dr. [Removed] consistently sends out messages during class linking various opportunities such as seminars for students to attend \n\n","In today's lecture, our instructor changed the seating arrangement, so we can meet other individuals in the course and grow more connections.","Dr. [Removed] is very encouraging of the learning process in general, and often uses [Removed] announcements to highlight opportunities for students to get involved in science outside of the classroom, like a [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] or a Guest speaker who is coming to [Removed]. In class, she encourages us to think about connections between genetic disorders and resulting phenotypes, which can be helpful for those considering medicine or research.","The teacher would relate the concepts to things we will learn later down the road.","Dr. [Removed] talks about how genetics comes into play in our future careers because genetics is a lot more complicated than it can seem on the surface. Through this, we will gain critical thinking and problem - solving skills.","Dr. [Removed] includes a reflection question on the homework that asks \" What is the most significant thing I learned and how does it apply to the real world or my life ( personal or professional ) \". She does this for every homework. She encourages students to think of the worldwide application of what we are learning.","Dr. [Removed] sometimes has us reflect on our true goals in life and I really appreciate this. It helps put things into perspective and allows me to shift away from the tunnel - vision mindset I sometimes have.","In our genetics course, the instructor helped us connect the material to real - life goals by relating concepts like genetic inheritance to careers in healthcare and reaserch. \n It happened in class and we were going over a problem and they said something along the lines of now if a medical professional where to do this what things would they look for.","The instructor would talk about certain genetics topics and connect them to real life diseases and problems, then explain developments being made currently and that we will have to understand if we choose a career in related fields.","On every homework assignment is a reflection question that asks how the material we learned that week relate to our lives or careers.","The professor is always connecting real world occurrences and what we will be learning and/or learned in class. For example, there was an outbreak of listeria recently and she connected it to how we were learning about how bacteria was able to multiply due to meiosis.","Instructors constantly remind us of how this class is connected towards our future goals. They are extremely supportive of us and wish us the best.","Dr. [Removed] made us write a reflection at the end of class that highlighted this topic. We were asked to write about what we plan to do in the future, and how our college experiences will help us to achieve what we want.","At the end of every homework set Dr. [Removed] has three questions that we can choose to answer as the 5th hw problem. These questions encourage us to apply what we learn in class to a real world situation in the world or our lives.","Something Dr. [Removed] highlighted from the beginning of the course was how it required students to develop a problem - solving intuition. Thus, even if we do not end up using genetics or biology in our future careers, it is very possible that the analytical skills we gain through this class will manifest in future classes or careers.","She made us write about our career goals and infer how the skills we learn in genetics can be applied there","There are always reflection questions related to real - world connections / impacts in every week's homework.","There's always a question like this in our weekly homework","The professor talks about the diseases that we learn about often.","The real - world examples of scientists who use the things we're learning about in class provide a connection between the classroom and life accomplishments. Additionally, in class we talk about different technologies that can be used in a variety of different fields that students in class may or may not be considering.","Dr. [Removed] makes sure that students that make mistakes have access to the TAs and her during office hours to ask questions about anything we might be confused on. Additionally, she makes more time for those students who didn't perform well on exams to reflect on their mistakes to fully comprehend their mistakes. This helps us to know how to correct our gaps in knowledge to apply them to further topics in the future.","On our homework assignments every week, Dr. [Removed] gives us reflection questions. One of the questions asks how the material will help us with real world applications.","My professor really likes the moon. He talks about it every day. He gives us an example before class of how physics can be used in the real world.","N / A","Relates physics to real life problems that may not seem apparent in everyday life","Dr. [Removed] has recognized that the students taking his class come from all different types of majors and are on various career paths. With this being said, he has applied what we are learning to different circumstances, each special to a different career path. He also has various models that he uses in class, and when explaining a problem he uses these models and applies them as a type of machinery specific to something one of his students might encounter in their life.","The instructor frequently related physics concepts to real - world problems and experiences, allowing me to explore how they could apply to various career paths. This happened during lecture.","He has compared physics to the real world","During class, I believe last week, Dr. [Removed] explained to us how physics is important to pre - meds and pre - dental students. He did this by emphasizing how important the way the blood flows through the body and how physics is applicable to our health careers.","The instructor encourages us to discuss topics regarding problems within our control and out of our control. This encourages students to take a new perspective not only on physics problems but life problems.","My professor always reminds us of a \" growth mindset, \" and that physics is everywhere! After our first exam, he reminded us that mistakes are okay and that all we can do is learn from them and not let our mistakes affect us negatively.","I remember my instructor connecting a lot of our lessons to real world examples. This can help us students understand how to apply these physics problems in real life. For example a few weeks ago he discussed how roads are slanted on sharp turns due to static friction which helped us apply this in class concept to the real world.","The day after the class had a low average on the midterm, [Removed] asked us to think of difficult problems that we would like to solve in the world. He related doing poorly on the physics midterm as another difficult life challenge and talked about how with a growth mindset, solving these difficult problems is possible.","Today in class, we discussed fluid mechanics. Dr. [Removed] acknowledges that many of his students are planning on going into healthcare, so he related the lesson to blood flow in our bodies.","After the second exam we reflected over our career and how physics is similar in the way it is challenging.","Usually, after exams, we have a class discussion about reflecting on mistakes. Dr. [Removed] always encourages us to have a growth mindset and not let our mistakes affect our well - being or self - value. This mindset allows us to view mistakes as stepping stones to future goals.","He shows us applications of our content in different fields like engineering, astronauts, divers.","The first day of class, Dr. [Removed] described the way physics has an impact on all of our lives and future career regardless of what we are pursuing. He showed us different ways physics is relevant in healthcare because I think a lot of the class was pre - health.","He makes connection to the laws of physics and how it may effect or provoke discussion on other aspect of life. For example, in medical circumstances.","Dr. [Removed] has reflections that we are able to complete that give me a place to reflect about another perspective for example one of the prompts was to think about factors that can influence a students ability to do well.","On one of the first days of class, Dr. [Removed] related physics to a heart diagram in order to show us how physics shows up in biology. Many of the students in this course don't plan on pursuing a career in physics but he helped relate it to professions that many of the students are going in to.","He's said we're capable and can learn","I think we were talking about astronauts. I really like the astronaut videos and how we apply physics to them. It made me want to go to space.","Before class, he will show us videos of astronauts or other careers and relate it to physics","Dr. [Removed] has us complete reflections on the course and often reminds us of things we can takeaway from this course, outside of just physics. One prominent example of this is in his discussions about what we can and can not control.","Yes, he always applying how we work in class will input how we will succeed outside in the world.","WHen discussing how hard the exam was, he related it to issues we personally want to solve in life ; these issues are big and hard, and he encouraged a growth mindset because in our future careers, we want to learn how to solve hard problems, not ignore them and chalk it up to \" it was too hard'.","He mentioned that we need to have strong problem - solving abilities when we are physicians one day.","During this corse the instructor makes clear connections to the real world. An example of this would be his connections to space and he also takes time to speak about our mindset.","The instructor often incorporates real - world examples, especially in the rocketry field, to illustrate how these concepts could apply to real careers.","He will remind us that big problems are big. Love it","Dr. [Removed] constantly describes how what we are learning is applicable to various common day to day tasks. He typically starts each day with a new example.","Dr. [Removed] equated the difficulty students had with the exam 2 problem set to the type of struggle we'll face when solving real - world problems in the future, like cancer.","Well for one physics is necessary for a lot of engineering jobs and he relates what we learn to real world examples of people using this skills in their job","In class today we were learning about fluids and pressure and the professor was talking about how we ( the students ) are going to be future doctors and can apply this concept to when we are taking someone's blood pressure","Dr. [Removed] has made it a recurring theme to adopt a growth mindset, which we can learn from physics and apply to our thinking in the real - world. As many students in his class are pre - health, he mentions relevant issues and describes to us how the problem - solving we learn in class can be applied outside the classroom as well.","He's very big on the application of biology to any type of medical field. During the cell - defense lectures, he gave examples regarding the future of medicine.","The professor will on occasion mention opportunities to study abroad and utilize their knowledge of biology elsewhere. This being said,   this is not making connections between the goals students have in the future and the course material unless they want to work overseas in their field.","My instructor was going through a lecture over defense mechanisms for various organisms. This happened around a week ago. He provided many examples of how the defense mechanisms smaller organisms and the process they go through everyday is similar to how we, as students, can keep moving forward in life to accomplish our dreams / goals. These smaller examples are encouraging.","I'm not completely sure when this happened, but I know once during a lecture he was connecting the content to health and biology majors. I'm also not exactly sure how in - depth he went, but he did explain it once.","In our course, the instructor organized a abroad research seminar in the third week, where we reflected on our personal goals and how course concepts could align with them.","He brings up how what were learning is relevant to the real world. Ans mentions how many professions we need to know what he is teaching","The instructor often commented on how this course will be necessary for the future courses most CNS students will take, especially pre - med students.","He talks about how biology is important in life on the first class and first unit.","He has talked about how taking biology and biology lab would translate to medical school.","He just doesn't","On the first day of class he told us that he believes that every one of us can do great in this class and in the future. He knows a lot of us are pre - med so a lot of his examples have to do with stuff in the medical field or labs.","Even from the beginning of class Dr. [Removed] asked us what we wanted to do with our biology knowledge. He said whether or not we were going into the medical field or doing engineering each concept was important and interconnected. After this happened during the class he has been connecting each topic to real world examples important to each field.","He often talks about the pre med track and the important biology for that specific career path but he also makes sure we learn about all the topic for biology.","Pre med professions are often discussed. References are made but these professions are not the main point of the course.","We often talk to each other in class. We do not have connections outside of class though. We have not networked for our future as a result of his class.","He connected material to med school and the medical field.","it was about a meeting for where we the students could meet and work for people that are in the fields that we want to be in and it was told about a month ago and reminders go out every now and then for it.","Our instructor reminds us that passing introductory biology is necessary for pre health professions. Our professor did this at the beginning of the year.","He makes multiple examples of real life problems matching with biological concepts.","Dr. [Removed] often helps to correlate his class to real - world examples. He talks about how we might already know a bit about what he is talking about.","Sometimes Dr. [Removed] will say that this course is a great start for medical school. This happens during class.","Multiple times Dr. [Removed] has talked about how [Removed] can help connect us to resources that will benefit us in the future based on whatever we want to do. He talked about getting into research laboratories, internships, etc.","He wants us to succeed.","Dr. [Removed] has mentioned to us that we could succeed in his classes if we merely listen. He has encouraged us in his lectures to become whoever we would want to be in life. I think this happened when he was teaching [Removed].","In the course, while explaining certain concepts, the instructor will connect these concepts to how they relate in the current scientific community or things in the past scientific community that led to coming up with medicine or discoveries.","During the first week of school he talked about having a planner to help pre meds know what specific things they need to do each year, and he has talked about research opportunities.","What : Dr. [Removed] encourages us to be great students. \n When : Nearly every class. \n Words : Uses inspiring words to help us.","Some data about data science careers was presented at the start of the lecture, allowing students to think about what they wanted to do with the knowledge and skills they gained in this class. This happened earlier this semester.","They included potential careers that we could move into with the knowledge we gain from this course.","instructor emphasizes the importance of coding in our job market and how valuable learning R is.","[Removed] [Removed] has helped make connections between this course and the things we hope to accomplish in life by showing us different ways that R [Removed] can help with analyzing data that is used in the real world.","She has shown us real world example datasets that show real information and data about certain things such as the housing market in [Removed].","The work with the city of [Removed] database is a clear example of this. It is real data that we can engage with and we can freely use it to create a project in the class.","Talked about how R is used widely in the real world and is an important skillset to have if you want to get into data analytics.","The teacher often shares how to apply what we are learning to real situations.","Connected it to various jobs such as analyst, finance, etc. in what we learn in statistics and R","N / A","Gave a briefing on how this course is relevant to the real world","She constantly stresses the importance of statistics and proper application of statistics. Last class ( 09/20 ) she mentioned how it would be unethical to remove data from a visualization if that data doesn't meet your expectation / would change your interpretation of the hypothesis.","This course is structured around [Removed] Science skills which are valuable for anyone looking to solve a problem using data. This happens constantly in the course since these are skills the course a structured around developing. Dr. [Removed] has mentioned that these are real - world skills that are used by [Removed] [Removed] and [Removed] [Removed].","Our instructor has acknowledged that we may not all go into the same career, but they've also emphasized through the class structure how learning more about statistics can be incorporated into your future career. This is less so something said in words and more so something reflected in how the class is more application based rather than exam based.","The labs and in class activities apply to real life data and applications. These aren;t made up data sets and completely fabricated numbers.","Show how we can use this skill in real life","The instructor has discussed data science as a career and all of the fields / subsets it encompasses, including her personal journey to where she is now. Through assignments and opportunities, she allows us to sometimes personalize the course to our interests and learn more about what we want to accomplish, such as choosing the data for our final project.","at the end of the class, always happened at the Each friday","During lectures, the professor would connect the information presented with a real - world application. This would help students to think of other situations, allowing them to make connections to what they would like to accomplish in life.","During her lectures, the professor explained everything in great detail and connected it to how it can be used in the real world. That pattern of teaching has been consistent.","She s very good at helping us understand this","Connecting statistical components with content in other courses.","She always tries to make real - world applications to what we are learning. Mostly uses scientific studies to show how we will use these skills in the real world.","In lecture, she has related what we're learning to how it could be used in a lab setting. As a stats class for science majors, I feel like she puts in an effort to relate it to research / medicine using examples. This has happened multiple times in different lectures.","She gives us real life examples as to how interesting and useful statistics can be. For example our final project is a way to utilize our hobbies and turn it into something statistical.","This week, we received the guidelines for our final research project, and Professor [Removed] encouraged us to explore topics beyond our school life. She provided a list of various data sets ranging from regular interests and hobbies to potential career fields.","We use a lot of real - life examples in the course where we are able to connect the formulas and problems we are doing with things that happen in everyday life. Using R - [Removed] has also showed me ways I can apply it to doing other research that I am interested in.","My professor tries to relate everything back to real world examples to keep us interested. We also had to do a survey about us that was then made into a huge data table to help us learn statistics.","[Removed] connected the real world, like football players to stats. She used a variety of words, like [Removed], goal percentage, etc.","Since the beginning of the semester, Professor [Removed] has said that we can and should put proficiency in R code on our resumes, and that it will be a useful skill to have which I agree with. She also allowed us to pick projects based on our specific interests, which could apply to future careers.","She frequently references medical backgrounds and how this can apply to those routes. Although she doesn't branch out much from that, its still helpful to see how this can relate to those medical field or science subjects.","She talks about different things she has done and different things we could use the course for. It has opened a lot of ideas for me personally as a future educator.","I would say that this was something that was addressed since the beginning of the course. Dr. [Removed] from the beginning of the course discussed her experience as an ecologist and how other ecologists are used all over the world to better understand the environment that we live in. How these ecologists have been able to make strides in the betterment of the world overall.","She told us about her own experiences being a terrestrial ecologist, showing it is possible to go on that path that most pre medical students are not on.","Gives us insight into her respective career in academia and how the world of academic study goes. Branches ecological concepts to other biological disciplines frequently.","That this course is a stepping stone for understanding things around us everyday, although most of us aren't planning to be ecologists.","The instructor makes many connections to actual labs and research that she has done. She describes how different biology majors can get involved in ecological work.","Our recent assignment requires us to use excel which is beneficial for many future career paths.","She would talk about how these concepts can be used towards everyday life. I can't remember the exact words but she encourages to use these concepts moving forward","She brings up potential jobs frequently that are from the get to know me quiz/ discussion we had. She'll point out certain things in lecture that can include more than one specialized interest when it comes to jobs.","Giving examples of the experiments could be useful for people who are considering doing something like that in the future. I think if it was mentioned it was more off hand then explicitly \" You could do this. \"","[Removed] Notes and discussion.","Not 100 percent sure how the professor has done this. There is no scenario where this could have applied is not very relevant to the professor's teachings.","the instructor during class encourages us to think of things we can do for the field, and suggests possible careers that might involve ecology","She had us explore different career options, allowing us to visualize how this course can impact our future job.","She usually caters to majority of her students that are going to health profession fields as the class is mostly pre - medical, pre - pa, etc.","[Removed] [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] AND ACTIVTIES IN HER [Removed] [Removed] THAT WE CAN REFER TO LATER.","She would talk about how we could use the skills in this course to further our future careers. For example, the critical thinking and logic skills we learn from this class could be applied to many of our fields outside of this course.","I can't remember if it was before or after the time period this is supposed to be for, but I remember her talking about different possible applications of what we were learning at that time. Dr. [Removed] has also talked about the importance of familiarity with excel no matter what field we go into","not clear when but she did","Connected physics to bigger goals in life.","My instructor gives real - life examples of physics. She does this during lecture, and these examples can be applied to our everyday life / accomplishments.","The instructor did not really do this besides demonstrations and allusions to real life scenarios.","The professor constantly reiterates the idea that students in this course will be amazing people outside of class. She states that our life has much more meaning than a class grade and we are people who matter. This means a lot to me as a student.","At least a couple of times a month, my instructor would talk about physics and the other possible job opportunities it provides. She would also talk about her experience as well as an immigrant german woman pursuing physics.","She often talks about her own experiences as a student, which reflect an openness and vulnerability to the class that creates a safe space. The emphasis is in helping to build our self - confidence that will help in other areas of our life, not only physics.","She would show her own stories and make the connections together so we can understand how things relate with each other and how we can benefit from it","She talked about how you can apply physics in everyday life. She also mentioned that physics is important to know in our future.","Professor [Removed] explained that it's ok to fail in physics and real life because you learn from your mistakes","She gives her own personal experience with physics and her life","Applying physics to how we might use it in the medical field or other professions after graduation. This has happened this past week when explaining the pressure of the fluid in a needle as an example for the fluids section. She also praised us for wanting to go into to the medical field.","I can not really remember.","The professor is often trying to tie the lessons and demos that we learn / do inside of class to things that we could / will encounter inside of our day to day lives as well as inside of any of our future careers.","Talking about how learning is a gradual process","In class professor [Removed] relates a lot of our physics concepts and questions to the medical pathway because a lot of her students are Pre - Health professionals. For example, when describing rotational velocity, she related it to a dental drill. When describing pressure, she related it to administering a shot.","She tells us struggling in the class does not mean we won't be successful in life, considering she struggled in her way to being a professional too.","Professor applies a lot of our material to real life scenarios. Especially since we're all engineers","During lectures professor gives real life examples of physics topics using demonstrations and occasionally discusses examples of where it is applied in real life.","He hasn't specifically mentioned what we will do in real life, but he has made connections to future classes and concurrent classes.","The instructor connects course concepts to applications. For example, he connected capacitance constant to flash drives.","He talked about his research and circled it back to physics and future careers.","He brings in demos every class to show us real life applications for what we are studying. He also explains how different industries use the concepts we are learning as well, like semiconductors and capacitors and other electrical design aspects.","A few weeks ago, the instructor discussed different ways which the concept of Torroids could be useful to engineering students and future physicists. He did this by telling us about how [Removed] Colliders utilize Torroids to move electrons near light speed - which I personally found very interesting.","Generally, the professor tries to make connections between what we learn in this class, and how we could apply it elsewhere. For example, he would explain his own challenges in the course when he was a student, and what he did to improve himself.","Sometimes prof. [Removed] will talk about the real world applications of concepts we are learning. He will explain how they can be used in research and lab work.","Dr. [Removed] often provides real - world examples related to the material we are learning at the moment. He once provided a mini lecture on his own lab's research ; this might be an example of applying course topics to potential future options.","Technically clear how these skills would be applied as a physicist, but sometimes unclear how we use course material in other roles.","[Removed] regularly describes how the content of the class will be used by engineers in their future careers as well as for researchers.","talk through real work examples and demos for us to see the concepts we are learning in action","The instructor connects the things we learn to what jobs they might apply to in the future.","I am certain that he does this because he always emphasizes that he doesn't want to just teach the course material. Rather, he wants us to understand the problem - solving concepts as well, which will apply to all courses throughout our time in college.","This was also in the first week of class. He asked what exactly we hoped to get out of this class.","He let us discuss about our favourite scientist in class.","He mentioned this during the first lecture. He said that physics and the problem solving skills taught during the course will help you in everyday life.","In the beginning of the semester, he told us about his area of studies and encouraged us to use the material we learn in this class to help us figure out what kind of career we'd want. He was a positive influence towards post - college endeavors.","The Monday before we took the midterm on 9/25, Dr. [Removed] gave us practice material, which was do redo some of our homework problems. He told us that these problems were useful in our future engineering courses.","Far reaching questions are encouraged, and people have asked things directly pertaining to their interests and have been met with well thought out responses each time.","Our professor stays grounded and relates the equations to real life applications that we can make sense of, everyday","The instructor provided a step - by - step guide on how to solve numerical problems using the given information. He explained how we must start with equations, rearrange them to useful forms, and only in the end [Removed] the numerical values to finally solve it. He emphasized how this is useful in almost every field of science and how it will help us simplify the process of solving numerical problems.","The instructor usually tires to make connections often between things we learn in class and things we might need to know for our future endeavors.","Brought in examples during lecture about different career paths. Talked about research and the evolution of speices.","I think that with our biology lectures, Professor [Removed] relates almost everything we discuss to broader contexts. Similarly in our discussions, we're encouraged to create metaphors that create a connection between parts of our daily life and classic biology terms.","she provides many opportunities for students to relate the content to their goals","The professor talks about how the course is foundation for medical schools and such.","Our instructors and [Removed]'s reassured me in my field of study throughout the semester. Making these connections from our classwork to my major made me feel reassured and safe in what I am currently pursuing.","Dr. G gives us examples of how to apply the lessons we learn in real life and how professors at [Removed] are doing so. She provides resources for her students in this regard.","Talked about life and teaching us the topic","I decided to schedule an Office [Removed] meeting with Dr. [Removed] on October 4th, 2024 to introduce myself and ask for some possible advice on studying, since I was not doing as well as I hoped on the quizzes. After discussing some possible ways of improving my studying ( focusing more on the objectives, doing the practice quiz, and looking at the lecture notes before hand ) the topic moved to my goals for the future, particularly my anxiety about not feeling smart or passionate enough to enter a STEM career due to my poor academic history. However, Dr. [Removed] encouraged me to still consider STEM as a possibility by stating how professional and academic settings are very different from each other and helping me look into various activities such as labs and events in the area of [Removed] that I was interested in.","2 weeks ago, Dr. G at the end of lecture mentioned professor who were working on reproduction topics such as \" [Removed] [Removed], [Removed] [Removed], [Removed] [Removed], and [Removed] [Removed]. This is specifically significant to those who want to further research in academia with either a master's or PhD program next.","We are often told about how topics in class apply to real - world studies or careers like what many of us aspire to be. She also explains how vital understanding some concepts are for those of us going to medical school.","The professor mentioned at the beginning of the term that the author of the textbook almost quit physics after he first introductory physics course, but then was able to go on to be the author of an intro physics textbook indicating we can accomplish anything we want to.","[Removed] Dr. [Removed] is aware most of her students are pre - med. There are multiple instances where she connects physics topics to potential medical education, or emphasizes the importance of skills learned in physics in the real world ( medical application ).","Dr. [Removed] use a lot of example in this course and connect it our daily life. In addition, Dr. [Removed] make connection on how a lot of example is applicable to our future job such as knowing wave length as a doctor.","During our lectures, she makes connections between the material we are learning and how it relates to our everyday lives.","Dr. [Removed] helps us reflect on how physics relates to other subjects","[Removed]'s teaching style creates an environment where we have to constantly be reviewing physics questions not only in the current chapter, but previous chapters. This occurs during the homeworks and the recent midterm we took. For future midterms we will continue to do this by revisiting challenging problems from previous midterms.","We were doing an assignment on time management. It was two weeks ago and she said these are skills that can transfer to all areas of life, even jobs.","I m not sure about when he said anything related to this.","This instructor teaches us life and academic skills and also touches on how to apply it to life outside of undergrad. Various strategies such as scheduling, self care, and more are all things she has touched on and taught us on how to utilize these skills onward","They offer office hours and provide resources that can help us interact better.","I do remember her explaining that time management is overall important not only as a college student, but also a general life skill. This is why she put an emphasis on us creating our planned schedule to study.","the course helps students understand campus resources and options for careers, so i feel this is an example of helping students understand [Removed] better and therefore their future as [Removed] students","Well last lecture we were focused on utilizing different formulas in order to find power. Then we were given a real world example were our work actually helped. This connection showed us that what we learn in class can be used outside the classroom as well I'm whatever we choose to pursue.","Throughout the first few weeks we did ice breakers where the professor related our majors and careers to the material in the course, much of it being engineering.","At the beginning of class two weeks ago, the instructor began by showing a picture of how he used what we are learning in his own research and then mentioned how E &amp; M applies to different engineering fields. I don't remember any exact words.","The instructor had shared how concepts from this class have helped him throughout his professional career. Furthermore he has connected these concepts to several areas.","Dr. [Removed] begins each class with either an anecdotal story or a message from another student about how to overcome any struggles during the course and often discusses how this introductory class lays the foundation for future learning in physics.","The instructor gives us an extra credit opportunity to write a paragraph about how the skills learned in this course and in college will help with things in future lifes.","Make connections to the way topics in the course affect real life jobs","She usually would reference how the physics is important. And she would do so by tying to relevant things. She does this quite often when showing a demonstration or working through a scenario.","The professor gave us examples of real - life situations and career paths that directly related to what we were learning.","Dr. [Removed] always encourages her students to delve into their options upon graduating, and frequently talks about her experience as a graduate student and post doc.","The professor would relate the course material to real world. For example, relating [Removed] to batteries, computers, and how some people do research about this for their phd.","Dr. [Removed] has talked to us before about different career options within physics — and outside of physics.","On September 11, [Removed] has sent an email about words of encouragement and reinforce the students with positive thinking. He is always about having a growth mindset and promoting this belief amongst the students.","He made descriptive and attention - getting [Removed] that gave advice relevant to school and everyday life. He advises every class and encourages us to explore what interests us and encourages us to understand why it interests us.","This occurs throughout the occur and is considered the basis of this class as this course is made to help us accomplish things such as goals in life by teaching us skills like writing emails and using a calendar to sort your life. [Removed] would have us do activities for the class that day that centered around a skill that can help us in the future.","we talked about testimonios and how it is important for people to give their own. so i think i could relate it to that","A lot of this course involves self - reflection on your own biases and ideas. This self - reflection has better helped me understand who I am and what I want to achieve. Therefore, I'd say this course gives you the ability to better learn about yourself.","Most of the article's we read talk about young latino males and other males of color and the choices that have been offered to them as they think or purse their future's, a lot of the time they have not been given a lot of resources or guidance or choices when choosing to a future career. Since we discuss these topics in class, our instructor helps us make correlations between what we read in articles and ways to maybe break that cycle and realize you do have more choices than what you might have been told and to explore those.","Sometimes when we would go over a certain topic, our instructor would give an example of how to use the knowledge in a career. He also would sometimes have videos of technology and explain how physics was used to create it.","At one point during this course, time management was the main topic of discussion. Our instructor taught us the importance of time management and establishing a proper schedule. She then went on to describe how this provides a good sense of organization not only now, but also in our future careers, stating how it sets us up for success."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Critical thinking skills can be applied anywhere.","The skills I can gain from this course will likely help me for my future classes because of the work required to gain an A.","When introducing this class, Dr. [Removed] took the time to show us how this class can be important in our future careers. Given that many are taking this class as part of pre - med requirements, he made sure to give medical examples of why physics is important.","He often relates the topics to our future professions.","Dr. [Removed] is very good at telling us we can do hard things, including things like solving cancer or world hunger. If the material does not seem important, he does a good job of showing us demos that explain why we should not speed around a corner, etc.","He does a good job explaining how the problems we are working on in class relate outside of class","All I can add is the growth mindset Professor [Removed] instills as well as reminds us that it will always be there as well as that physics is used in daily life!","Every class period Dr. [Removed] will explain the learning objectives.","Although I can't remember him explicitly stating the benefits of these skills after college, he does relate these things to everyday / experiences in the real world. I would say he tends to do this in the beginning of the class, where he tries to make us understand what we are talking about from a more perceptual view.","Dr. [Removed] had a coversation about growth mindset and not giving up when we approach challenging questions because those problems are what we're facing in the future. And we can cure cancer!","Especially in the first week of class, the professor made an effort to determine the makeup of our class and their future career goals. The majority of the class raised their hands to indicate they were in a health science major and we discussed previous courses that have been accomplished to be eligible to enroll in physics.","Every time Dr. [Removed] teaches a new subject, he starts by explaining how it can be seen in our everyday lives and how it is important to us. This helps students to realize and appreciate the importance of what they are learning and connect it to the real world.","[Removed] always connects what we're doing to real - world things. Whether that's a big thing like the [Removed] missions or a small thing like walking. He wants us to see that physics is not just a bunch of theory, it's a science that can help us understand the things we experience and see in the world.","Physics are a daily part of our lives. This happens almost everyday and he isn't wrong. Physics are everywhere.","He talks about how putting effort into things you do often comes with a reward in the results, that applies to all aspects of life including his course.","The real world examples help a lot in making sure that these concepts do indeed apply in real life","I do not recall our instructor identifying skills that can benefit students after college in this class.","He bring up current day problems and connects the concepts we are leaning to them, showing that physics isn't only something just for college and requirements our degrees","Dr. [Removed] explained to us how [Removed] applies to healthcare, especially when he mentioned that our testing strategies will help for thoes taking the mcat.","Time mangaement skills","My instructor has many times informed how his class is a stepping stone to future endeavors. He encourages the premeds to go to medical school and chemists to pursue grad school.","He's spoken about his real life experiences and given real life examples of the things were learning about and thus what they're connected to in the real world. This was during unit 2, he showed us some fossils he found himself in his backyard, displayed real - world application.","He talks about how his class provides a fundamental understanding of [Removed] one that will be built off of in the future. In addition, because he talks about how each topic is seen in the real world, students are able to make the connection between that class and situations they could encounter in the future.","He makes every concept very application based so even just fundamental knowledge we gain from this class can help us in the real world like understanding the basic building block of life so we can make smart decisions with what we put into our body in the future.","In almost every class Dr. [Removed] will make connections with content we learn to different fields and areas of study.","Dr. [Removed] often connects our class material to real - life application scenarios. Specifically, he connects our lectures to topics involving nutrition and medicine.","During the first few weeks of class. We were told that our fundamentals shape our experiences in later classes and this would allow us to implement it in our jobs.","Dr [Removed] often makes connection to the real world, and how biology and chemistry overlap. He also talks about research opportunities fairly often, and how to get involvved.","Dr. [Removed] emphasizes how connected biological processes are to our daily lives, often using real - world examples like sugar - free products, eating different pigmented vegetables, and storage of excess acetyl CoA. In other words, Dr. [Removed] clarifies skills developed in the course that can benefit students after college in terms of their physical health.","He discussed how biology is applicable to many other sciences, and how it is the foundation of many disciplines within the college of natural sciences.","During lectures he always talks about how learning and truly understanding the different concepts of this class will be very beneficial to students that are planning to go into the medical field or even going into some type of science lab.","Dr. [Removed] always reminds us how this class is just the start of our journey as pre - med students(for myself, but also acknowledges pre - dental and etc. ) and how everything we learn in his class is the building blocks for the rest of the classes we take in the future.","He would continuously delve deeper into the topic we are discussing and help us understand why it would benefit us in understanding the world.","About once a week, during the introduction of class, Dr. [Removed] will explain the relevance of the topic we discuss in the that lecture as well as provide opportunities such as research for students that's will benefit us in pre - medical pathways.","Dr. [Removed] really emphasizes the idea to understand a concept and not to memorize it when going over material in class. I believe this is helpful in the future outside of college, because memorizing information, such as for medical school, does not necessarily mean that I will be able to apply it to real life instances.","He relates the content we learn in [Removed] [Removed] to our professions ( pre - health ) after college","When Dr. [Removed] is talking about certain topics during lectures he refers that we may remember this in our future careers. I can not remember any specific moments, but it happens somewhat often.","She will talk about how important data science is and how applicable it is to other fields","she showed what the skills can do and she did this at the begining of the course.","Many data science projects involve teamwork, and students must communicate their findings effectively. These experiences are invaluable in the workplace, where collaboration and clear communication are essential. \n\n","Dr. [Removed] has made it clear in the past week how coding can be useful to make graphs for any data we are trying to represent.","The professor continually reminds us how she has used the skills that we are learning in the real world and how practical everything that we are learning truly is.","These are all industry standard programs, methods, and pipelines for students to present data. Very very very useful stuff. Constanly mentioned in this course.","When explaining how cleaning and interpreting data in R [Removed], Professor [Removed] explained how in the real world, data is hardly easy to clean and understand quickly. However, she provided us with solutions on how to wrangle data to make more sense.","She told us about career opportunities.","I do not remember the exact details, but she has brought real - life scenarios into lecture and explains some important takeaways we get from it using the class's content.","Everyday in class","They have mentioned how the tools and skills we used in this class could help us in future jobs","Throughout the course, it has been mentioned how important data analysis and coding is especially in a world turining digital","She talked about how data wrangling is done with big data sets in October.","The professor often connects data analysis with potential careers in the future. When looking at data, the professor talks about how the analysis may affect our future.","In class when presenting slides","Dr. [Removed] shares how some of the concepts we learn in class are applied in data science / stem careers.","just talk about the course","The instructor showcased the most used programming languages and skills used in [Removed] [Removed] roles as well as what jobs can be offered for those with experience in [Removed] This happened about a month ago.","Professor [Removed] enabled us to work with real data from the [Removed] of [Removed] to show the students how statistics and coding in R can make a real difference in examining data and drawing conclusions.","Made it clear since the start of class and gave good examples in how R can be useful in analyzing data sets every class.","At the very beginning of the semester, Professor [Removed] would talk about data science and the skills needed to be in the field.

A specific example was how to win a certain game show. We participated in group activities to figure out the answers ourselves, then we would put all of our data into one excel sheet to analyze which method would work the best.","I believe [Removed] briefly mentioned at the beginning of the semester that she would teach us statistical skills that will be useful in our future jobs.","A lot of the times the professors mentions specific examples in class when do practice problems over specific topics that relate to what many of the students in the class are geared towards in their career path, public health, biology, and sociological / psychological studies.","Talked about how stats in used in research. Through the second lab","Using [Removed] can be useful for resume and future jobs.","The instructor told us about how we can use statistics [Removed] our own lives and is going to make us do this in the upcoming project.","We went over the importance of stats in the very beginning of course in order to see the greater benefit in the long run.","She uses examples that are simple and relate to real life. For example she wanted to know if her cat was sleeping too much compared to the population and this could be used to determine whether they need to visit the vet or not. She uses examples like this pretty often and it's easy to see how stats is applicable to us even if we don't go into research.","I felt like we worked on real world applications of data","These benefits were stated in the beginning of the course when talking about the syllabus and how this course can be helpful in real - world problems.","This course will help me with future things like the [Removed] and other classes in the future. The teacher told us that this will be helpful if you plan on pursuing a medical career. This happened at the beginning of the course.","I think she. gave us a real life problem in which we applied statistics to it.","Professor [Removed] emphasizes how the statistical analyses we have learned from this class can potentially help us in post - graduate research, healthcare careers, etc.","She used real life examples such as citing game shows and how people could win if they knew the specific statistics to follow.","Emphasizes how we can use statistical tests and apply it to our real lives.","She emphasized that R [Removed] is an important skill to develop if we plan to go into research or other fields that deal with data analysis.","She s talked about how what parts of what we're learning can be applied to different jobs in STEM.","Dr [Removed] often described in the beginning of this course how an understanding of ecology can help students understand conservation and ecology efforts made by the government or corporations. With the threat of things such as climate change, many conservation threats are current and Dr [Removed] described how a basic understanding ecology may aid students to understand these threats.","Dr. [Removed] provides real - world examples of how ecological research is conducted. We also occasionally watch informative videos in class about what ecologists do in the field and as a job.","Dr. [Removed] tells us this during the beginning of lecture, especially when she says that the math models we use will be useful in the future.","Mentioned how this course prepares you for after college during syllabus and course introduction.","In our first discussion section we had some readings about pursuing a future with an ecology background","The professor prioritizes excel abilities in projects and talks about how these skills will be useful in the area of study and for other courses.

And the [Removed] Note projects are super helpful for people specifically going into research related areas in an easy and less intense way.","She helped us get better at excel since we would need it in life. she thinks about what we need to know about ecology to know the world better and such important environmental facts.","She did emphasize on how each points of the contents can be applied to the real world such as analyzing environmental happenings and identifying what's a carbon sink or a source.","In discussion we read about how ecology is used in a vareity of different fields and discussed it with the class.","She talked about how students learning new study methods and practicing to be better [Removed] something they were not good at the beginning is very important for life.","She likes to speak before she goes into lecture and makes me relate to her in a way that makes feel like I could learn the skills","Our professor continuously will tell us relatable stories that she went through in her journey of becoming a physics professor, and has taught us skills that she learned that we can apply to our lives. Also the in person demonstrations are relative to real life and can most certainly be applied to benefit us after college.","The skills developed in the course can benefit students after college because students will have learned a new language. Students will be able to travel to different parts of the world, restaurants, or any places and utilize the new language they learned. It will be nice for the students who learned this new language to connect to others who speak it, whether that is their teacher, other students in class, or people native to the language.","On the first day of school she mentioned how we might not use physics on the daily after college. However, she said that a good understanding of physics will allow us to interpret the world around us.","My recollection of this event was the professor explaining her persistence in the subject as she had suffered with self - doubt. She told us if we could learn to not be so doubtful and be open to help with physics then we could apply that to other areas of our life. This occurred during a few different lectures.","Learning about failure will help in life.","She sometimes talks about how physics can be used outside of the classroom. Examples include medical settings.","Today during lecture, we learned about liquids and pressure. Dr. [Removed] used an example of a syringe and mentioned how she used this example because a lot of us are pursuing careers in healthcare, and she wanted us to understand how physics applies to our future careers.","I think the instructor mentioned developing analytical skills and learning how to apply the skills they learn here to different topics.","The instructor would use real life examples to show where physics would potentially be used. The professor also was very supportive of the level of physics experience when learning each topic.","She talked about how this course can help in the future by providing real life examples.","Focuses on building a positive growth mindset where students are not limited to their current skills.","Markert talks about how physics is important and how it relates to us everyday.

This is super helpful to determine if I am in the right major.","The instructor compared how concepts about electricity and circuits were connnected to real life applicaations.","Physics can be applied to anything in the world so it is fundamental to understanding the basics of science.","Most of us in the class are engineering students. He talks about how the physics in the class is relevant to our future careers as engineers.","During the intro to the course, Dr. [Removed] acknowledged the different reasons students may take this course, and he explained its connections to life. After the first exam, he shared a story about his first college exam, and it showed me a life lesson of not being afraid to ask for help after failure.","Professor [Removed] said a couple of weeks ago that the study habits we create in this course will help us benefit ourselves after college. I thought this provided a helpful perspective.","Dr. [Removed] talks about many different engineering applications and demonstrates how the content we are learning allows us to understand these applications. These applications are showing us, as students, how physics could be applied in our future experiences / [Removed] / [Removed]","The professor may connect a topic to a real - world application that could be linked to our future careers.","Dr. [Removed] stated the skills, mainly critical thinking and applying physics material to real world problems, will help in our future careers related to STEM. He stated this at the beginning of the semester.","At the beginning of the course when the professor was explaining to us the process of redoing our exams, he explained to us why we are allowed to redo them. He explained that he wants us to get better at the learning process and redoing the exams helps us to see how we can learn better.","Sometime around the beginning of the course the lead instructor described the values of the course material beyond the course itself and in a future career setting. He described what we would learn and why it is important.","Dr. [Removed] provides us a lot of feedback on how this could help us in the future when it comes to after college. She helps us discover the things we like such as providing a lot of resources about research programs that we might like.","My instructor explains that learning the skills in this course like question and hypothesis formation is going to be important in any future career. She emphasizes critical thinking in her discussion assignments which will be beneficial for the future.","Dr. [Removed] talks regularly about the importance of life - skills and knowing how to work well as a human being on top of being eager to teach us about biology. Around the time of each quiz, she'll ask us how we think we're doing, remind us to be smart but also kind to ourselves, and to remember we are capable.","I remember the first day of class when we were going over the syllabus. She was going over the part where she said we would have content questions every week in which we would have to submit a question we have over the lectures for that week OR something we are curious about. It really stuck out to me how she said that it is important for us to always ask questions and stay curious in general. She said \" It's important to always be asking questions \" and I think that can be applied to things outside of the classroom. That is how we improve things in our life and gain deeper understandings. She also mentioned how no question is stupid and shows that we are trying which I also really liked.","We were talking about [Removed] squares, last week. Dr. [Removed] mentioned many of us are most likely pre - health and further delved into the topic because we may have to take genetics later.","She always puts at the end of her slides professors that do research in the topics we've covered and encourages contact with them for a greater understanding of the subject and possibly a way to get research experience for a future career.","In our biology course, the instructor often connected course material to real - world applications, like healthcare and environmental sciences, to show how these skills could be beneficial after college. During discussions, especially around topics like cellular biology, the instructor would highlight how understanding these concepts is essential in fields such as medicine and biotechnology.","Tells us about how things go beyond college and into real world.","After our first exam, Dr. [Removed] told us this information and course will be useful for us who are pursuing a career in healthcare. She said it is challenging but we are able to get through it.","She says it's a college level physics course so the skills we gain are hard and challenging but will help us critically think. She also explains that for physics we need to think simple like how to get the answer and that's it!","It was the second day of the of class and the instructor asked us a question that was asked during [Removed] interviews. It was a relatively simply question that required us to apply typical logic. The instructor noted that these are the kinds of things we'd have to think about in everyday life, as well as in this course","Dr. [Removed] calls some of us future Doctors and says how being confident in our answer is important for our future career and how it's okay to take risks. She will also try to relate certain physics topics to real life things and different careers.","When we do physics problems we discuss sometimes how engineers will use these same skills / methods","Dr. [Removed] understands that many of her students are pre - med. She often expresses how the material we are learning will help us on the [Removed] and as a physician. Additionally, sometimes she will give us physics questions that we answer by a show of hands. She will then ask us to defend our answer, and she expresses how being able to defend what you believe or explain things to someone is important for our careers.","Dr. [Removed] talked about how physics and problem - solving can be useful for our future careers. He's said it doesn't matter what our future career will be because this course will help nonetheless.","Dr. [Removed] encourages the importance of general physics understanding to comprehend the world around us. As a many students are prehealth, this plays a big roles in our career","The instructor Dr [Removed] was giving announcements at the start of class when he stated that it disappoints him when people don't think of themselves as having a physics mind and drop the course without consulting him. Preserving and trying new things are skills that can benefit one after graduation.","The professor provides real - life examples which help to take abstract concepts and apply them to tangible experiences. This can be applied to scenarios where students may consider a career that encompasses these situations \n","We were discussing time management in one of the first few weeks of the course, and our instructor gave us examples how she still uses the same strategies she was teaching us for college in here everyday life.","My instructor has preached to us that preparing for the real world is an essential part of college. This is because when we are in college we are getting a little taste of what the real life experience truly is.","My instructor used examples from her personal life to give us guidance","The instructor mentioned that after finishing this course we would be doing everything by ourselves. This was around the half way point of the semester. I don't remember the instructor's words","During one of our lectures, my instructor mentioned how she had worked in many different areas throughout her life and how at each stage she developed skills that would later help her in her next position. She told us how what we're doing now will play an important part in our life after college. How we do in our classes, how we connect with others, and how we carry ourselves will positively impact how we do after we graduate.","Study habits and communication skills we learn in class can be helpful for anywhere outside the classroom. When we learned about the best way to study for an exam, she demonstrated not to procrastinate and to always put the best effort in.","Every mourning Professor [Removed] starts the lecture slides with a fun cool scientific slide and explains how it relates to our material and the real world. This usually ends with him talking about his own studies in the telescope field and his own jobs that he got after college [Removed].","The occasions I remember mostly occured during the kinematics unit. When we worked on problems, Professor [Removed] would sometimes provide examples of the material applying to real life, and how it does so. This would either happen in the middle or towards the end of class time.","The professor has stated multiple times about how this basic / foundational course in [Removed] is designed to bring everyone - no matter their background - to a level playing field, allowing students to develop the skills needed for their future, more advanced courses and post undergraduate studies.","I think we where learning about a specific equation and Dr. [Removed] said that if you knew how to solve these equations consistently it would help you get a job","Last week in class Dr. [Removed] talked about how materials, specifically dialectic constant &amp; capacitors is important to careers in researching battery technology.","Dr. [Removed] always tells us the importance of what we're learning in class and how E&amp;M is important both in physics in general, but also in grad school ( and other future career paths ).","A lot of the time, she mentions how learning this material will teach us how to approach completely different problems, even outside physics","I believe that after this class, I am able to know how to manage my time and use my resources.","Our professor near the beginning of the semester told us we would end up using these skills throughout life. Most of what we are taught will continue to stick with us because the things we learn are important for our lives after college. We learn time management, note taking, etc that are all things we will still do even after college.","He has helped us see how being a part of [Removed] can help us further our education and improve the experience that we get at [Removed] [Removed]. He has talked about the connections that we can gain through. this course and the other ones we take, while also encouraging us to keep trying our best.","Well not directly after college, but [Removed] helps navigate future semesters and years here on campus. Each week the seminar gives reassurance to each student so they feel more knowledgeable on the resources available to them."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

This offers examples of why different materials in the real - world behave as they do.","She talked about backgrounds of professor and sometimes some things that are happening in the world.","She talked about how chemistry is used in everyday life. We see reactions everyday and are able to even taste them in the food we eat, things we drink, and etc.","She mentioned what its like to be a scientist dealing with issues that have to do with chemistry, which excited me. This was recent, I believe when we were first dealing with bonds.","I'm not upset that this criteria hasn't been met, it's just the course material we're learning right now is pretty straight - forward and \" real world \" examples about molecule orientation and VSEPR models doesn't necessarily require a real - world example.","On the fourth week of class, my professor mentioned haw what we were learning and then connected to the real world through her own learning experiences and relating to her PhD.","The instructor showed us an example about fireworks and how that related to our studies","It was when we were going over the spectroscopy spectrum and how she admired Dr. [Removed] ( the guy from the videos ) in how he visualized orbitals and their relevancy to atoms.","When Dr. [Removed] taught us about the photoelectric effect and [Removed], she incorporated real life examples of light and wavelengths that we interact with often to better help us understand the concepts.","Considering the course is about chemistry, which is very applicable to the real world, most of the material covered is a \" real - world example \" and \" application \" of material.","I don't specifically remember what it was, but I feel like I remember some times where a topic would be mentioned and an example of its use would be referenced. These are not focuses of the lectures just might be occasionally brought up.","The instructor always related what we learned to practical real - life applications, such as when we learned about emission spectra. She told us that this is used by astronomers to tell what elements are present in the atmosphere of exoplanets.","We were learning about the wavelength spectrum, and she often made real - life connections when describing how the wavelengths will excite / relate to the electrons. She made the comparison of microwaves spinning the electrons in an atom the same way it spins your food in a microwave oven.","Showing us demonstrations and common examples of compounds in real life. This was towards the beginning of the year when we were discussing the light spectrum, was a very engaging lesson.","other ways to think about it","My professor will use examples of everyday thermodynamic processes like ice melting or combustion from a fire to illustrate what we're learning in class.","Professor [Removed] normally has a lot of examples within the lecture slides that try to relate what we are learning to something that is tangible for us to understand. Like ice melting to gibbs free energy and the transference of heat. She does this frequently in class.","The professor explains real - life examples in conjunction with the concepts learned, which helps students better understand new knowledge. Occasionally, they also conduct experiments to deepen students' understanding and leave a lasting impression.","Throughout the unit, my instructor will perform demos to demonstrate certain processes we've learned. As she performs them, she talks about the chemistry behind it and how it relates.","The example problems we do in class always have something to do with the real world. Our questions on out pre - class modules are also related to the real world so that you can think about how it may apply to your life.","The purpose of some equipment and how it relates to what we're learnjng","She does this with just some basic examples with certain chemical reactions and even demonstrates these chemical reactions in class.","Doing the actual experiments in person to demonstrate the relationships between variables.","There were times during the end of the lectures where the professor brought real life chemicals to experiment and show us the result of what she was teaching. \n","We just had the solutions unit so it was easy to incorporate examples like water or dry ice to think about properties","When my class began the thermodynamics unit at the start of this week, the professor applied path and state functions to real life phenomena life logs burning in a campfire and ice melting.","We are currently learning about thermodynamics, and she helps the class understand by using real world examples such as wood burning.","She does real world examples sometimes. She was like be careful you might get wet and then proceed to create a cloud","It was last Monday and we the students had to pretend to \" be the system. \" She used different hand / arm signals to represent work and heat being done to us \" the system. \"","With melting of ice","The instructor uses examples of cooking an egg and the way in which the heat that comes off results in an exothermic reaction.","She always uses real world examples to explain the concepts that we are currently learning. It helps so that we can understand the relevance of it to the real world.","During the thermodynamics unit, she used examples that are well known and simple to understand like melting ice.","We have fun examples in class. We've seen the different colors of exploding balloons filled with various gases, balloons being inflated or deflated using liquid nitrogen","When introducing new topics, the professor will bring in modern ideas and examples into the lecture. Usually has a real - word application to it, such as new discoveries in chemistry.","She demonstrated experiments with balloons and liquid nitrogen.","Sometimes during the chemistry lectures, the brings out graduate TA's that perform physical experiments about the topics we are learning about. During [Removed] law she brought out balloons filled with different gasses to explain the photoelectric effect. During boiling points she brought out different liquid gases to see how fast they boil. She has used liquid nitrogen and balloons to explain the ideal gas law.","uses examples that help us understand","she would explode balloons","She would use examples like fire burning for thermo. She also uses really cool experiements","The instructor mentioned in class how we can use what we are learning in real life.","When we went over stuff in Unit 1, she went over how this applied / worked in a real world setting.","The course incorporate real world examples through using life - time examples.","She would show us videos of the applications or sometimes real life examples of chemistry.","We were talking about bonding in class and there was a demonstration of the shapes of what the atoms truly look like in a three dimensional space. This demonstration occurred in the second unit of the course and the instructor asked us questions to allow us to find our own way to the answer.","During the first week of classes, Dr. [Removed] showed us experiments of how burning different elements resulted in different colored flames. This was cool because it connected to the lectures that week and we were able to learn why the different colors were created.","experiment","There are chemicals in the real world. Like in my lecture this week, she would show how common substances ( water, methane, etc ) would appear as molecular structures.","She demonstrated minor experiments like different flame colors and electrical glow. At the beginning of the year.","The Professor incorporated the real - world example when talking about ions dissociating in water. She mentioned it in class and it was in the presentation slideshow as well. She used the example of [Removed] that we see often, dissociating in water as a way for us to connect and understand the concept.","From the first day of class, Dr. [Removed] has included demonstrations of the topic we are learning in class at least 4 times. For instance, when learning about electromagnetic radiation, we got to see how different gases interact with a flame ( each gas produced a different color based on its atomic composition ). Most recently, the past two classes ( [Removed] and [Removed] ), Dr. [Removed] has used a 3D model of molecules to help us understand molecular structure.","Dr. [Removed] has talked about how bonding works for chemical applications we see everyday. It helps us understand the content of the course.","The instructor frequently incorporated real - world examples, such as discussing the chemistry behind environmental issues like climate change and pollution during lectures on thermodynamics and chemical reactions. This typically occurred when introducing new concepts, and the instructor would say, \" Understanding these chemical principles can help us address real - world problems, like how carbon emissions affect our planet. \" By linking theoretical concepts to current global challenges, the instructor made the material more relevant and engaging for students.","In [Removed] 301, Dr. [Removed] frequently incorporated real - world examples into lectures, making the material more relatable and engaging. For instance, during a lecture on chemical reactions, she discussed the science behind everyday processes like cooking and environmental pollution, showing how the concepts apply outside the classroom. He emphasized, \" Chemistry isn't just in the lab — it's all around you, \" which helped connect theoretical topics to practical applications. This occurred regularly throughout the course, particularly when explaining complex concepts.","Professor [Removed] has previously connected things we learn in class to higher level lab work.","During lectures. Professor [Removed] provides examples of the material in real - world applications through experiments, which happen at least once every month.","It is chemistry, everything she teaches she has to equate to a real world example because this is the study of the make up of the world.","Our instructor mentions certain topics and how they relate to the real world. This occurred in a past lesson as they mentioned solids and how they connect to the real world.","When talking about endothermic and exothermic reactions, she uses examples of water freezing or evaporating to help us understand the concept better. We have also done a live show of a balloon exploding, which helped us further understand exo and endothermic reactions.","In the learning modules she uses examples that can easily make sense for things we see in real life like potato chips for calorimetry.","In the course, the instructor used real - world examples to illustrate complex biological concepts, like how certain environmental factors affect human health.

This happens almost every lecture, as we usually do practice problems with these various examples.","This occurs as a connection to different chemistry stuff. She uses demonstrations which show examples of the usefulness of different reactions.","We do demos in the class relatively often, once every two or three weeks. The demos she gives us are usually applicable to real - life processes and and she usually explains why things happen and how we can use them.","Show lived demo and provide pictures with the lecture slides that describe real life material and objects","Most of the questions we solve are real world examples","When explaining concepts ( ex ; the properties of liquids ), she connects it to real life application. For example, she used images of a bug on water to explain surface tension.","She created an experiment with dry ice and water. It wasn't per say real world, but it actually happened.","Throughout the course, the instructor regularly used real - world examples to illustrate complex concepts, saying, “ I want you to see how this knowledge applies outside the classroom. ”","Whenever we were learning about intermolecular forces, I think that the real - life examples helped. Such as, viscosity and honey, surface tension and the water strider, etc.","The professor incorporates examples and applications into the lecture materials as well as the learning modules we complete before each class. These examples usually detail how specific concepts apply to broader ideas in the real - world. While discussing chemical reactions, the professor highlighted the chemical reaction that takes place in rockets and cars.","Discussing how chemical reactions are seen in everyday life, and the daily world. Also describing common place objects with their molecular components to help us understand how   chemistry is everywhere.","Everything we learn to related to stuff in the real world. Whether it's how its used in the real world, to real world examples, to different careers.","She does demos and experiments in class to show us how the things we are learning apply to real life. For example she lit up different colored gases to show us how photoelectric theory works.","When we went over electron configurations, Dr. [Removed] made sure to explain which elements displayed certain configurations and why this is important for various fields of science. She went over this in lecture. \n","Again, I can not think of exact details where this occurred. We discuss when different chemistry topics were discovered and how they are important in different instances, how this affected the realm of chemistry as a whole, and more.","Dr. [Removed] in her modules and a few times in class has connected the models we learned about to more practical applications in the medical field. She has talked about the importance of chemical bonding behavior to more relevant and common uses by scientists.","She showed the neon light colors and lit balloons that popped in different colors.","Our instructor would give us videos to watch and have us see diagrams that helped represent how what we are learning in class is applied in real life.","She incorporates the use of real world chemicals for the lab application. This is helpful to understand the process of what happens during the labs.","The professor explained real - world examples of topics such as electroscopy that we learned about. Some of the topics we learned about in [Removed] were also directly used in our chem lab.","She did real time experiments / demonstrations at the front of the class that were very cool.","Almost every lecture, she explains the concepts in class by using real life examples to help it make sense to us. It also helps us understand why we are learning the materials.","We discussed the [Removed] spectrum about 2 weeks ago, and she provided real - world examples for each wave on the spectrum, allowing us to visualize them. Ex : UV rays are so strong that they cause sunburns.","Mostly in the beginning of the school year, but we would have demonstrations with elements which both helped explain a concept and entertained the whole class which is really helpful in such a big lecture hall.","I don't truly remember exactly when she had incorporated these things into the course.","How wavelengths can be seen around us","The instructor would explain more in depth about the contents we would have to prepare before lecture, and we would have ample time to practice the material during lecture. Students had help through teaching assistants and have active learning practices.","They did demonstrations of concepts that in class","The instructor would incorproate examples of what she did before.","The course itself is the \" real world' but in a microscopic level or a deeper understanding of our surroundings. For unit 3 lots of the word problems where based on volume, gas, pressure, and moles. Which are real world reactions, and are applied in research and overall the real world.","When learning about reactions she talked a lot about phase changes which happen all the time in every day life. Learning how water freezes is a good everyday example for teaching chemistry.","She tries to incoraporate real word examples when explaining certain concepts to try to make the concept more understandable and applyable.","The professor usually uses examples that are simple objects that everyone knows to demonstrate properties or any sort of happenings that we are learning.","The most popular application that Dr. [Removed] has to incorporate real - world examples and applications into the course lectures is having experiments during class time. This is not every class, it maybe happens twice a month, but it is extremely entertaining and interesting when it does happen. Most recently, she blew up a pumpkin so that it would look like it had a face carved into it. She will do these experiments towards the end of class so that we can learn the lecture material and then see the real world application on it.","The demos in for gas laws such as the compressed balloon really helped explain the relationship between the gas laws variables.","Shows chemistry applications within real world situations and demonstrates them through experiments","The instructor constantly provides real world examples of how the different chemical reactions and properties we learn about can be seen in everyday processes.","She talks about pistons and balloons for volume in thermodynamics. She outlines real examples all the time its kind of hard to name specific examples.","Dr. [Removed] put on an experiment where she mixed some solutions and they reacted. I thought this was important because we learned the different results of mixing different solutions.","She would do small demos in class, thunderstorms, or crushing cans to explain how different units would be in our daily lives. She would also explain laws, give real - world examples, and how we could see them in our day - to - day life, balloon expanding, breaking a pencil, etc.","She uses real life items during experiments to show us that there are real- world examples.","Through out our learning she has provided multiple examples of real life scenarios to explain the topics we are currently discussing. Recently she used a bag of potato chips in our learning module to explain a topic.","Sometimes, Dr. [Removed] will include real world examples in slides that are medicine related or apply to the way the world works. This happens about a few times a month.","This is constantly occurring when we do practice problems, using specific grams and calculating what's necessary. We do practice problems a lot in class, which would tie into doing real - world problems or applications during lectures in this course. The instructor is really good at giving us time to solve this problem first and then going over it with us clearing up anything we did not understand.","She usually starts a unit with demonstrated reactions which helps use understand the reaction. She does this many times in a unit.","We have regular demonstrations of concepts that are very enjoyable and something to look forward to.","When learning something, she likes to use examples such as melting of ice, water freezing, etc. to make things easier.","There are experiements done in class that show what specifically is happening and further the understanding of why we are learning something. An example of this is the exploding pumpkin that made us understand the low gas heat capacity and the reaction that would happen with it. There are also sections in the lecture notes that connect real world examples.","All of the in - class examples are real world examples, such as saying \" an open water bottle \" or \" a cup of coffee \" and talks about them as chemical reactions.","She did this through the use of basic principles with ice and water to show different states of matter to explain transitions with thermodynamics.","Like make problems with real world situations","She used the elements such as the co2 or [Removed].

This is a spontaneous reaction ( negative delta G ).","She talked about the real life application of the project we are conducting.","We learn about antibiotic resistance.","The TA reminds us our research is important. We have the potential of finding a new antibiotic.","Our instructor introduced us to the [Removed] [Removed] Project. This is a way for us to apply our research to a real - world problem the world faces with antimicrobial resistance.","Usually in the form of music playing as we conduct experiments.","In the prelabs, we often explore the real world applications of the properties we learn about. The one that immediately comes to mind would be the discussion of penicillin. Additionally, we do ethics assignments and often have to think about our experiments in terms of life interaction within the real world.","In our pre - labs we have to read and analyze research that is relevant to our work and real - world applications","I don't remember any instances this happened.","The provide examples that make concepts more easier to understand. That is helpful when learning something you don't know.","She gave us a lecture on [Removed] [Removed]'s real life impact and how our lab is contributing to their research.","The lab we are doing incorporates real - world examples and applications.","Explain how our work occurs at scale in big labs. \n","Dr. [Removed] has centered the entire course around a real - world problem of antibiotic resistance. Most assignments require us to research and complete pre - labs that put the scope of the course in comparison to the real world. This happens most weeks with pre lab assignments. The instructor does not lecture students but rather sends [Removed] messages about upcoming due dates.","I don't remember exactly","Well the whole point of the course is that the soil isolates are found in nature. These things are naturally occuring in the environment","When doing the earlier pre - labs, we learned about common bacteria that expressed the properties we are studying, such as antimicrobial - resistant bacteria, as well as the effects this has in the real world, such as death due to antibiotic - resistance.","They talked about how the techniques we practiced in lab are going to be useful in other research environments","Our instructor requires us to watch lessons that involve modern day research and ethical discussions where our class discusses the recent issues. Not only do our peers discuss these issues, but there is always different perspectives from those affected by the material discussed and expert discussions or articles.","Avery talks about how some bacteria in a lab environment can't grow","I remember when we were doing the ampicillin lawns she explained how this is used to find real life antibiotics i found this very interesting.","She likes to prove that everything we learn in lab is also applicable outside of lab. This most likely happened before lab during her presentations","This project is connceted to real world problem ( antibiotic resistance )","One time, the instructor explained the real - world applications of [Removed] and how the amplification of a single target gene has changed medicine and biological research. There were several examples shared, but I can't remember off the top of my head. \n","Being in this [Removed] Lab course also puts you into the [Removed] [Removed] Project, a network of undergrad students and researchers looking for antibiotic - producing bacteria from soil. Being a part of research that can directly impact the world and communities makes this course feel more special and rewarding.","I don't remember exact examples.","I can't remember an exact moment when my instructor did this. But, I am sure it would be along the lines of a famous researcher, or when certain devices were used, etc...","We talk about [Removed] [Removed] a lot, and the research they are doing to help fix the anti microbial resistance crisis in the world.","Our instructor uses our research frequently ( [Removed] ) to show what [Removed] [Removed], a research group focused on antibiotics, is doing in the world with undergraduate students. We use this to relate what we're doing to what students have done in the research world and how much they have learned about antibiotics. \n","The way incorporate real - world examples and applications into course lectures or materials is mainly through the prelabs where they show how the research has changed the world and will continue to do it. Also, my instructor tells us in class how these techniques can be applied to other STEM fields as well.","Professor always mentions the importance of our labs and how they contribute to out [Removed] [Removed] goals against antibiotic resistance","The entire course has real - world applications and examples due to it being a research course. We are constantly looking at real world examples of other research done on the same topic ( antibiotic resistance ).","Collaborated with big research institutions like [Removed] [Removed].","The whole program of [Removed] [Removed] gives real - world applications of the course material as it is an initiative to find new antibiotics to combat the antibiotic resistance crisis.","Our whole course centers a real application of biological lab techniques : antibiotic discovery from natural products.","They talked about the real world example of the antibiotic crisis and how it is impacting us. tHis happened at the beginning of the course.","In the lab we work with actual lab tools and with real bacteria / samples that can be easily applied to future research venues that students may take. In our prelabs we learn about the current research or understanding that we need for the labs.","The course is centered around real life issues like antimicrobial resistance so it's not really that the instructor talks about the applications every class but more so that the purpose of the class is to make real life contributions.","She would tell us additional information. For example, when we were learning about [Removed], she talked about how [Removed] uses the [Removed] process.","Our course involves the [Removed] [Removed] Project, which is a organization that is trying to discover new antibiotics. We as students are trying to discover these antibiotics from soil sample we collected. This incorporates a real life problem where we need more antibiotics to fight off illnesses","Our instructor talked to us about the [Removed] [Removed] project and how finding antibiotics can help the future.","I don't remember specific examples but I do remember hearing a few pop culture references.","One specific instance that stands out is when we discussed the application of microbiome research in soil health. The instructor linked this to current agricultural practices, illustrating how microbial communities impact soil fertility and the fight against soil erosion.","Our instructor would use real world examples in our pre lab assignments as well as In our quizzes, in occasion.","The professor included various examples in the autosomal disorder section such as sickle cell anemia from the deformation of the beta part of hemoglobin due to a recessive allele also there is an example of [Removed] as a [Removed] which causes a faulty [Removed] protein that damages nerve cells. Also, they mentioned the [Removed] gene which appears in males from the [Removed] gene area in the Y chromosome. These examples were given in various classes from two weeks to one week ago and the words they said during it was that it explained paths of inheritance for those disorders and separately how male formation works.","Professor [Removed] showed us news articles demonstrating the applications of genetics in the real world, like [Removed] and the cure to sickle cell anemia.","Since the instructor teaches a genetics class, incorporating real - world examples / applications is relatively straight - forward. She is able to relate inheritance patterns and mutations to different species and diseases in everyday life.","When discussing sex - linked traits, Dr. [Removed] used the specific example of [Removed] to explain how sex - linked traits work through a pedigree. She specifically demonstrated how [Removed] was passed through the royal family as a X - linked recessive trait. She also used the real - world example of tortoiseshell and calico cats to demonstrate how sex - linked traits result in mostly female cats.","Our professor publicizes lectures we can attend and also provides real world experiences in class relating to genetics in the real world.","When talking about genetics, the professor could apply certain [Removed] phenotypes to diseases that impact people in the real world. This is a good application if you are also interested in medicine.","Dr. [Removed] has examples of diseases that are relevant to whatever topic we are learning at the time. She explains how it relates to the genetic topic.","She includes different examples of diseases and other relevant examples that apply to the genetics topic that we are learning in that class that day. For example, she brings up the example of the [Removed] disease in order to apply to the topic of slippage and triplet repeats that occur in DNA sequences in the [Removed] region. Using this example helps us visualize what are the consequences of the mutation occurring in our DNA sequence in the real world.","We talk about real - world experiments and ideas that contributed to genetics and scientific knowledge of biology. We also use real diseases and genetic abnormalities to discuss the impact of various genetic processes.","Dr. [Removed] always attaches recent advancements and publications into the lectures. She seems to be very familiar with current world events.","In nearly every lecture, real - world examples are used extensively to inculcate understanding of any given topic. The real - world examples are incorporated into the learning process in this course.","For certain modes of inheritance, chromosomal interactions, etc, Dr. [Removed] would provide a specific trait or disorder that followed the pattern. This allowed it to be clear how our analysis of genetics factors into real world outcomes.","Many times during the school year, we have gone over recent diseases and other illnesses that are relevant to genetics and how they are being tackled.","For many of the modules in class, she has discussed or linked articles on real - world examples and applications of course material. For example, during the first week of class, she discussed instances when genetics were in the news, such as when the [Removed] approved a sickle cell treatment that used [Removed]. Additionally, for every textbook homework assignment, she includes a question asking us to reflect on what we learned and how it applies to the real world.","At the beginning of lectures, she sometimes discusses current events in genetics or even connects to real scenarios that showcase a certain theroy that we are learning.","This happened when we learned about [Removed] genes and how they play a role in determining sex in males. We learned about experimentation in rats and how a real experiment was able to determine that these 9 genes directly controlled gender.","For example she briefly mentioned [Removed] I think at the beginng of the last unit ( DNA sequences and stuff ). She said something about it relevance and put up some news briefly on the board.","Dr. [Removed] provided recent research regarding what we were learning in class last week.","Dr. [Removed] explained the different experiments and researches done with the course material we were learning to be able to understand the material better. Additionally, Dr. [Removed] often gives reflection questions that allow us to reflect how the material could be incorporated in the real world.","In the lecture slides, Professor [Removed] will provide real - world examples of what some mutations or conditions look like and what individuals with these conditions experience. Sometimes she includes ones that aren't in the textbook. She also adds articles at the beginning of each module in canvas that cover real - life connections to what we're going to learn in the module.","Since we talk about genetics ( and specifically health ) a lot in this course, many of our lectures include real life applications of the topics cover. For example, we are currently talking about diffusion in class, and Dr. [Removed] included cystic fibrosis as an example of how diffusion can affect health. It makes the content a lot more interesting to me ( someone who is pre - health ), and helps me understand the relevance!","Dr. [Removed] will talk use relevant examples to show real - time application of concepts. For example, she talks about genetic engineering, she's used common conditions like sickle - cell anemia or hemophilia!","Dr. [Removed] has used lots of real - world examples in this course from using actual diseases / conditions that can be developed and telling us how they are inherited to telling us about the way discoveries have been made and who made those discoveries. \n","Problem examples are usually based in reality and at times she references real genetic events or unique episodes.","She gives us problems to solve based on real world situations both in and outside of class","We are taught genetics concepts in class but also regularly practice these concepts by doing HW / Quiz / [Removed] problems that put them in real - world [Removed].","She used our real world data for our lab","The instructor talked about real world diseases and real world genetical developments and explained the biology behind them.","She would compare genetics to real life subjects in slideshows.","Since it is genetics, she would mostly reel in medical experiences and genetic probability of diseases. It exposes us to different types of diseases.","Dr. [Removed] includes interesting research articles about a certain topic about what we are learning about at the beginning of the module that we study in class. In class today, she talked about the impact os [Removed] and [Removed]'s discovery of the double helix structure of the DNA. Dr. [Removed] said that the structure of DNA was found due to those two people.","She provides current research articles that relate to genetics","Dr. [Removed] explains real - world research in her lecture slides. By including information about current events, the relevancy of the information we learn is apparent.","She gives examples in class","Sometimes during lecture, Dr. [Removed] would make connections between our class discussion and a news article or a new development of technology or a specific case study that exemplified the topic being discussed or uses / applied a topic that we discussed in class. For example, discussion about [Removed], videos of first hand accounts of stories of DNA sequencing, exploration of DNA databases, case studies about genetic experiments, news articles, and more.","During modules 9 and 10 the instructor gave many examples of current bioinformatics databases that are used to sequence genomes. This was brought up during regular lecture and presented as new content to us, she also went through a demo using each database","A lot of genetics is real world, and so when certain mutations or instances of significance we're discussing come up in class, Dr. [Removed] uses direct examples or images to show the real - world examples. Real world applications also come up, like in gene sequencing or how we identify suspects at a crime scene.","Several times in the beginning of lectures she has talked about things relating to genetic sequencing and how it is being used in medicine and ecology.","Throughout many lectures, Dr. [Removed] incorporates real - life history regarding the research on whatever we're talking about and current uses for the technology. For example, we were learning about genome sequencing, and she used real life examples of crimes being solved due to [Removed] and DNA comparison due to sequencing technology.","Our instructor always tries to apply genetics to real life. This better helps us understand.","Dr. [Removed] gave an example in lecture about a week ago about the [Removed] [Removed] winner in chemistry for a computer model to predict protein sequencing. She said that this is an amazing advance because we are learning about how complex and long the sequences can be and how difficult it is to predict structure without the model.","She did not.","The example problems in class are asked as instapolls and they reflect real - world diseases and syndromes that allow for insight into personal interests. Dr. [Removed] encourages discussion of these questions and collaborative work for these specific problems.","Pretty much every time we jump into a new topic, the history or research of the topic is used to introduce the new lesson. This helps form connections and garner interest for the topic.","Incorporating real - world examples normally happens each lecture since genetics itself requires learning applicational uses to cloning, gene frequencies amongst a population, and genetic expression.","It's a lot of work, but so worth it!","Sprinkled throughout the course were genetic diseases that we now know the cause or cure to due to developing technologies and research. For example, a recent development in treating sickle cell disease was introduced to us after learning what caused sickle cell.","When introducing a new topic, he makes sure to include an example such as things related to [Removed] or everyday objects.","Dr. [Removed] always shows us how the physics we are learning about is used in the real world. His examples always include space exploration which is awesome.","We have been focusing on forces recently. In one particular example, the instructor used the model and compared it to pushing an object up a hill.

He does this by showing various [Removed] videos about a real - world scenario. Some specific ones I have watched so far include the mechanics of skydiving from space to display certain external forces and an air hockey table to display the removal of friction. These videos and examples with the use of his models have allowed me to understand the bigger picture better and quicker than if I did not get exposed to application tactics.","He always uses real world applications of physics in our lecture to help us understand. He even uses videos from the moon to help us understand","The instructor brings in models that can be tested throughout lecture.

Basically every problem / question we do can be applied to the real world.","Every lecture has real world examples","In each of the units we cover in class, our instructor normally performs demos that help us understand what we are learning. With that said, even though the demos are easy to interpret, the material is not always easy. \n","As a class, we were discussing gravitational force and how it applies to our space systems. Dr. [Removed] showed us a video on the moon and the sun and the relevance of [Removed]'s gravitational pull to them.","Dr. [Removed] does a demo practically every lecture that helps incorporate real - world applications and examples into the course material.

He gives a lot of space examples and real - world examples on how physics is used. ( [Removed] 13 )","The number of times the professor used space and the [Removed] missions as examples in class is utilized often in class. \n","My professor has used countless examples from space missions to relate to physics. This has been the case for the past couple of lectures. My professor quotes words from said space mission and then relates them to physics.","I guess I sort of answered this in the previous section, but [Removed], at the beginning of pretty much every class takes a few moments to connect what we are going to be learning to a real - world example.

He tied this back into what we were learning that day, evolution.","When we were going over some biological processes, Dr. [Removed] would talk about how the food we ate for lunch impacts the various systems in our bodies. He was also able to connect some of the concept we learned with cell structure with the plants that he would grow in his garden that he would show the class.","I do believe that Dr. [Removed] tries to incorporate as much of the material as possible into real world examples. I would say that he does it every class.","In our [Removed] class, the instructor regularly incorporated real - world examples to help us understand complex concepts. For instance, during a lesson on cellular respiration, they explained, “ Think of how our bodies convert food into energy, just like how a car uses gasoline. ” This happened during our discussions on metabolism, making the material feel relevant and easier to grasp. By connecting the science to everyday life, the instructor not only engaged us but also reinforced the importance of understanding biology as it relates to our own lives and the world around us.","He's so so sweet but he doesn't really explain the diagrams. You have to venture to figure out what's going on a lot of the time and it's a lil frustrating only for it to not be on the test … like cmon.","One example is when Dr. [Removed] mentioned how L - dopa is effective, but R - dopa is ineffective. This was happening during unit 1.","She used examples relating to earthquakes","We looked over real data sets and analyzed them with the tools we had learned so far in the class.","We were given the opportunity to look into the datasets compiled by the city of [Removed] for our project.

Also, our project aims to work at using overall data from the [Removed] government.","When lecturing about the course content, the instructor continually utilized real world examples to explain concepts within statistics and provide practice problems for quizzes.","I have realized that by taking this course statistics is everywhere, even when you don't notice it. The topics / examples / questions we talk about in class are related to the real - world.","She used soccer statistics in the example slides to show us a real - world example.","After the first class, she had us take a survey. We then used that data collected as an example to learn about probability. This was incredibly engaging, and the examples helped me understand the material ( the different types of numerical and categorical data ).","We used the \" [Removed] \" game as an example to find the probability of something. This is a real life game where you could apply the elements of statistics in order to have a greater chance of winning a car in the game!","During the first few lectures, she had us do an activity in a group where we would come up with how statistics would be useful in our future career and then share out to the class.

In addition, on one of the homeworks, we read a short research article about physicians and patients and answered statistical questions about the article.","We learned about standard normal distribution and the instructor used examples of wight to hip ratios. This is relevant to the real world because it shows data that had been reported by individuals and how this data can be relevant to the rest of the population. This happened this past week and the instructor explained what this ratio was and how it worked.","I remember a certain example given when going over that correlation does not equal causation. She used the example of peddlers in [Removed] being at intersections with a higher crash density, but it was actually because peddlers were at more high - traffic intersections. I feel this is an excellent example of real - world examples in the class that helped me understand the content better.","We do many examples in class where we look at real world examples. Recently, we tested among the students who had the same birthday among us.","She once analyzed survey answers from a survey students took. She went over categorical and numeric data as well as how each are analyzed.","One of the example problems in class went over animal preservation efforts in national parks. And how a certain species of animals population is affected overtime through preservation efforts.","Dr. [Removed] talked about all the different applications that statistics has within different career paths.

This happened during the beginning lecture.","The instructor frequently shows slides of living organisms that relate to the topics we are learning about and explains how each organism relates to the subject material.","She uses examples of animals, studies, etc when defining a vocab term","Since our class talks a lot about climate change, we watched keystone species videos and we've talked about corral bleaching in a lot of lectures in the past weeks.","The instructor had us do an interactive activity during a discussion section, where we looked for real - time pollination. The instructor has also had us do a project in which we see the carbon emissions and temperature change over time.","in the powerpoint slides, there are many examples that relate to the real world. For example, there was an example about the rain shadow effect in [Removed]. This happened last week.","The subject of [Removed] is the study of ecosystems around the world they make up. This study is almost entirely based on real - world examples of interactions in ecology, and even if they don't refer to a local or popular real - world example, it can be easily tied to one or deserve a space for its own novelty.","When discussing weather events, we discussed the rain - shadow effect that occurs on mountain slopes near the ocean. When discussing this, she provided real examples of the [Removed] mountain range in [Removed] and asked us to explain how this weather event occurs.","For the majority of the ecology topics, Dr. [Removed] incorporates a real - life example to ensure we understand the concepts.","Our content covers ecology which is very easily applied to real life examples of climate change, changes in ecosystems, etc. So it's basically constantly mentioned","In her slides, she puts examples","she always uses real world examples, in almost every slide to show how relevant all the class info is.","Talked about examples in the community of climate change, plant types, etc.","She will provide examples of what we are discussing in class by mentioning her research or providing examples of locations near us.

I think this is beneficial because it's much easier to see when in practice rather than throwing information and equations at you.","Professor constantly does demos of the topics learning about in class. These demos give an example of the topic in the real world.","The instructor has done a lot of demos that showcase how specific principles work. He has also discussed how certain demos can be used in the real world. I remember him doing a demo where he cooled down wire to increase the B field(I think ). He then went on to talk about how this can make circuits more efficient.","During the labs","He gave the example of Eratosthenes measuring the circumference of the earth using the length of a shadow.","During our prelectures and lectures, the professor gives examples about how physics affects vehicles, canons going off, and the static force on buildings like the Leaning [Removed] of [Removed]. Occasionally we also have problems based on the examples he gives us.","He's put up several examples of real life experiments performed by early physicists and use them as logic to explain modern day phenomenon such as why we can't feel the [Removed] rotate.","We have had topics in which he would illustrate events that have occurred and connect them to our current studies.","This course is called engineering physics in which most of the applications we learn about are applied in the field of engineering. Dr. [Removed] is really good at creating problems or examples that reflect real - world scenarios that people may encounter in their respective engineering field / [Removed]","Professor [Removed] consistently incorporates real - world examples, including complex scenarios involving centrifugal forces, normal forces, and fictitious forces.","We were learning about gravitational acceleration the last 2 weeks and Dr. [Removed] always gave us real works examples that make sense because of the laws and equations that are given to us. He would go over theory first and then give us a multitude of examples.","Most of the time, professor would expand on the subject and bring in real world examples and problems. Especially during a discussion of a squarecap question, he would relate it to a real world phenomenon or problem.","Early on in the course when we were reviewing geometry concepts he explained the concepts to us through the story of how we figured out the world was round. He showed us the process of how [Removed] deduced the circumference of the earth to incredibly close accuracy by observing the shadows of sticks on roughly same longitude but different latitude and showed us how we can use [Removed] we are learning right now to solve this.","We were discussing kinematics and projectile motion. The example we looked at had a ball falling in the shape of a parabola on a flat plane. However, he suggested that more than likely in real life most objects would fall over a cliff instead. He then proceeded to write out how we would solve the problem where the ball would fall down the cliff instead of on a flat plane.","It's tough to provide real world examples in a class full of idealistic models, especially at this point in the course where we're just getting into everything. But just today, the topic of how much entropy is transferred from the sun to the earth came up, and I think that's a great example of how he's helping us to build intuition of how the world works.","It's hard not to incorporate real - world examples in thermodynamics since it happens everywhere. Ice melting alone is a good topic that can teach many ideas.","He explained example cases of temperature decreasing as energy goes up ( [Removed] ), entropy goes down as energy goes up ( ferromagnetic metal )","I remember he uses the example of microwave to discuss the thermodynamics.","For every concept, Dr. [Removed] provides real examples involving real species and organisms in her presentations. This happens each class and she explains the examples thoroughly.","She makes sure to provide real life examples and explains the ways they impact our lives. This helps students understand the material better.","Gives real world occurrences of some of the phenomenon we learn about in class.","She would explain research that is done as of current time ( that is related to the topic ). She would relate the topics things we would experience in real - life such like weather in [Removed] or relatable examples.","Dr. [Removed] regularly uses real world examples. She also puts pictures on the slides and uses word problems to help us understand.","We have described many real - world phenomena such as someone throwing a stick in the air to describe kinematics and angular velocity / acceleration.","The instructor regularly references real - word examples when lecturing about physics concepts being covered in class. For example, when teaching weight and mass, the instructor brought up the example of elevators.","She brings out many models for us to see.","She does this a lot. Real world examples are pretty common in physics. Just asked if anyone cut their finger with paper and said it was caused by the friction   by the [Removed] paper.","Most real world examples provided by the instructor come as a form of demonstration. For example, once, to show [Removed]'s laws, she used hammers and blocks to show that an object in motion stays in motion, and objects in place tend to stay in place.","I remember the professor talking about elevators and weight change when we were going over that closer to the beginning of the semester, and she even encouraged us to go ride in an elevator specifically to feel how it made our weight change.","Had lots of practice problems in class about real world problems and setups that helped us understand the concepts more","We always connect the course material to real world applications and many practice problems in class relate the material to things like cars, space science, and everyday activities.","Talks about situations that can happen in real life and works them into problems","Dr. [Removed] shows us demos of a few of the problems we see in class. These demos are very insightful and help us visualize what happens in the natural world.","Most of the problems we discuss in class are real - world examples","Dr. [Removed]'s example problems and lectures often incorporate real world examples and we can picture and relate to.","Dr. [Removed] uses a lot of models in class, and he shows what we're learning as it applies to the real world.","All of his problems are based on real world application","[Removed] uses [Removed] so we can visually understand the concept.","Physics overall is a very easy applicable concept for the real - world. Most examples are realistic questions that come from a real - world setting.","Last week, the Dr. [Removed] presented a question about a car going in a divot. This question was to learn more about circular motion.","The instructor related kinematics to cars. Velocity can measure the speed of the car and acceleration is related to pressing on the accelerator.","Dr. [Removed] would incorporate things such as the “ [Removed] ” into problems. This happened before the first exam. This would make the problems more applicable to me as a [Removed] student.","talks about how physics relates to us walking to class or him walking from his office","We do demos in class everyday to show real life examples of the content we are learning!","Usually when we go over a topic, Dr. [Removed] goes over the applications of the topic in the real world","Every class, the instructor will ask students to give her examples from their own experience and relate them to what we're learning. She also makes a lot of jokes and keeps the spirit high.","We have many discussion about what we can do once we get our degrees and what the best options for what we want to do are.","In the course, we always discuss real career paths that relate to our majors.","My instructor gave an example of a researcher who was from the [Removed] of [Removed] and was educating the public on the [Removed] vaccine","She talks about her real world experiences","In class today, [Removed] talked about her major when she was in college and how her career didn't specialize in her major choice.","Many of the concepts we learn are hard to visualize or put on a scale that is reasonable, so he will equate values to colloquial uses of them, like the voltage of a circuit to a tea kettle.","Almost always incorporates real world examples after teaching the theoretical concept like the underlying principle or equation. The professor also comments about the feasibility and expected outcomes when performing this in real life.","Professor consistetly relate's lecture topics to natural phenemenon, [Removed], and applications to physics research. Very engrossing.","He will often include videos of how what we are learning applies in the real world ( transformers, generators, etc. ) and will almost always have a demo to also show what we are learning.","He does this pretty much every class at least at the beginning and he also uses [Removed].","Dr. [Removed] will present real - world demonstrations during both in person and prerecorded lectures, illustrating physics concepts that we are learning.","Experiments and real time examples explaining specific physics applications in the real world \n","Speaking on chemistry, the professor spoke on many life experiences of hers in terms of learning the material. This helped to bring everyone closer and make them comfortable among each other","making questions involving real world topics","They would take some examples that are happening right now and try to incorporate it into the lecture alongside the material we are learning right now.","using [Removed] nearly every day to help explain concepts","The professor does a lot of in class demonstrations. Since the subject is very abstract, I find the demos to be very useful to aid my understanding. The professor typically always has some sort of demo out during class and does something with them around 50 % of the time.","The professor brought a large battery / conductor to class.","Our instructor illustrated two real world examples of effective and ineffective studying habits and the consequences of each ; one being cramming and the other involving studying half an hour everyday a few weeks before the exam.","he asks us questions about our interests and relates that to our topic if relavent","While we were discussing schedules, the TA, [Removed], explained why we need our degree audit, how we access it what it is for. She then showed us her degree audit to get more acquainted with the how and the visual explanation of the what and why was very helpful for me.","In some of the readings / articles I had trouble in understanding the article and I decided to contact my instructor to help me understand. We met on zoom and the instructor had given me very helpful advice.","My instructor has been able to relate some of his personal experiences to articles that we read and discuss in class, which in return enriches us as students cause were able to hear from someone else's point of view and gain more exposure into the topics we discuss about.","After we discuss and hear someone's presentation on the article that was assigned for the week, our teacher then leads a group discussion referencing real world scenarios that we could relate to and dissects the article in terms that sometimes simplify what they were trying to convey through it","He'll give quick demostration of physics. For example, if we're learning about currents bringing a high voltage circuit to show the actual effect."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

I thought it was a great way to incorporate the TV show into our learning because I used to watch a lot of jeopardy with my grandpa.","The instructor has only sort of mentioned pop culture references.","She doesn't really do this too often but she makes jokes about the football games at the start of the class. However, they aren't related to the content.","Cause I'll does this by mentioning things from pop culture in her lectures. This keeps us engaged and focused because we can relate in some way.","offers classes to take","Like holiday events, such as [Removed] pumpkin experiment. Including elements of what we already know.","This happens thoroughly within the course.","In this course, we have a demo almost weekly and they usually align with the timing that it is presented during. For example, during Halloween time we had a demo that used a pumpkin.","Dr. [Removed] would incorporate students' interests by having real - life examples of an experiment she was explaining to us. Such as, the exploding balloon experiment where each balloon has a different gas and would explode in different colors.","I'm not sure this happened. I wouldn't consider this pop culture, but she mentions chemistry youtubers sometimes.","I don't think my prof has.","I honestly can't remember the exact specific reference, but I'm pretty sure there have been a few pop culture references here and there.","She has not incorporated students' interests yet, but she has introduced us to experts of certain topics of chemistry.","During lecture the instructor would bring up the football team and how well they are doing at the time and talk about national rankings.","No the proffesor hasn't incorporated pop culture","n / a","Dr. [Removed] will often find real - world applications to the content we are discussing in class. This is exemplified through in - class experiments which are particularly interesting and fun to watch.","During halloween week, Dr. [Removed] briefly talked about how the exam was a day before Halloween so it worked out well.","She blows things up a lot, which in general I would say is a student interest because everyone is always engaged, and she blew up a pumpkin once which was a tie - back into the season and kind of fun.","She usually starts off the class with a small conversation which is good for getting attention. Topics that would be interesting to college level students","I feel like she might have incorporated student's interest into course lectures but I don't have a specific example for it.","The instructor showed examples of memes and 21st century references to make the kids laugh. This happened throughout the course on the slide show that is presented to the entire class.","There haven't been any popular culture references.","Whenever we learn about chemistry, she uses a lot of examples. The examples are always related to something that we know about and chemistry. This makes it easier to connect chemistry to our daily lives. She did this last week while in a lecture talking about thermodynamic reactions.","She asks us to make up memorization words / phrases to help us study \n\n","The professor utilizes many ways to keep us engaged in the lecture and uses modern techniques. She does stuff like mini labs at the end of the lecture to further prove everything she was lecturing earlier in the lecture.","The teacher showed us cool experiments that correlated with the materials we were learning in class. on Halloween, the teacher was teaching combustion and performed a combustion experiment with a pumpkin. The teacher then explained the process of gas exchange and how it exploded the pumpkin.","In my chemistry course, the instructor connected complex topics to recent popular science trends by referencing real - life applications, like the chemistry behind electric car batteries and climate change solutions. During a discussion on redox reactions, they said, \" Think about the lithium - ion batteries in electric vehicles — understanding these reactions is key to advancing sustainable technology, \" making the material feel directly applicable to current innovations.","She had asked about where we would like to travel","She just references for things in the future. Happens for future courses and medical careers and etc.","Professor [Removed] sometimes mentions the importance behind the concepts we cover in class by linking them to current research projects or explaining the relevance in today's modern world. It's really helpful because it shows her students the big picture behind why we are learning the concepts in class and how they are significant.","It is more found in the modules than her actual lectures. There are few tidbits here and there, but it is ultimately not substantial enough to remember.","I can not say I can for sure reference a specific moment, but Dr. [Removed] is very mindful of our interests and tries to relate difficult concepts to something more simple that we may enjoy and may make this topic easier to understand. She has done this several times. This happens throughout her lectures.","Dr. [Removed] was explaining a topic in the course the last few lectures, and stated that those of us who would be going into the medical field would really benefit from learning about this specific topic.","At the beginning of the semester, the instructor held a demonstration where she showed us different colors of the visible electromagnetic spectrum by using fire and different elements in balloons. She then tied this into our interests by explaining how these elements could be used in everyday life.","I feel like my instructor has not incorporated pop culture references into our course lectures. However, I'm not really affected by it because I feel like there is a lot of chemistry lecture material that we should go over instead of having references.","Professor [Removed] keeps her student's attention by doing cool and interesting demonstrations. The first week of class, she did experiments at the end that captured the whole room's interest.","n / a, I just pressed whatever is close to the \" next \" button.","told stories about that part of knowledge","In the course, the instructor often incorporated current events or popular culture references to make the material more relatable and engaging. For instance, during a lesson on social media and communication, the instructor mentioned, “ If you've been following the recent TikTok trend about …, ” and then tied it into a broader discussion about how digital platforms influence public opinion. This made the lectures feel more dynamic and connected to things we were actually interested in, helping to spark deeper discussion and making the course material feel more immediate and applicable. \n\n\n","I can't exactly remember, just think she has.","Our instructor has used pop culture references sparsely in jokes, but I can not name verbatim an event as such","Never happens","She did an experiment with a pumpkin on [Removed]","She talks about how certain topics we are covering will be later used in our classes and relates them with certain things we saw as kids.","This didn't occur","Today [Removed] the instructor answered a bunch of questions I had about pigment producing bacteria when I asked him if anyone had tried making biosynthetic material out of pigment producing microbes.","[Removed] always plays great music during class and will talk about music with students! You can tell she cares.","Music, making connections with students, etc","We have learned about antibiotic resistance which is a very important issue now a days. And has grown to be a focal point for me as now I'm more careful about taking antibiotics and encouraging others to do the same, to advise them to seek a doctors perspective or just to have them know the consequences of not following the prescribed directions towards said medications.","In the course, the instructor often integrated popular culture references to make the material more relatable and engaging. For instance, there was recommened podcast and youtube videos. This connection sparked lively discussions and made the scientific concepts more accessible, encouraging us to think critically about real - world applications.","They played music we liked during lab.","She lets us pick the music","I think this has happened in the perusals prompted by the assignments and questions.","I'm not sure","In our labs the TAs put on music for us while we are working and asks if we would like to add an music that we like. This happened during the first week of labs and still [Removed] this day. I genuinely like it when they play music because it feel comforting.","During our prelabs, Dr. [Removed] always finds a way to incorporate student interests into the material. She will add interesting content about what we are studying, like adding extra information about bacteria, the antibiotic resistance crisis etc","play music during lab from recent times and encourage talking amongst lab mates.","I can't remember what she said exactly, but there were times that my instructor would refer to how a certain topic were doing in lab to what they did in the real world.","The perusal assignments were typically about recent ethical issues in the media.","The course incorporated this by looking at trends in 23 and Me and other DNA testing services on perusal.","Sawyer definitely incorporates popular culture references, and she even plays us music every class and asks us for recommendations. She makes the classroom environment very friendly.","The instructor ads recent event, events or new discoveries in bacterial discoveries to help us keep engaged with our research and be involved in up - to - date events.","During our lab time she allows us to choose the music we want to listen to as we are working. This allows us to be more comfortable in the setting and preform better in lab.","Through the usage of [Removed], and research on papers related to the program. I gained a better understanding of the antibiotic resistant crisis.","The entire course is based on a real world pop culture reference.","Mrs. [Removed] does this by playing popular music during our labs!","I have worked in an antibiotics lab before, so most of what the instructor covers, I can relate to ( my interests ).","The TA is business focused and I like that. We get work done and we get it done effectively.","I'm honestly not too sure about it but I faintly recall it happening in an educational context. I could be entirely wrong though.","The instructor is always making sure to give us relevant information that can be used in the real world. In that way, she incorporates our interests or recent popular culture references into course lectures or materials","I don't remember to be honest.","She always has on music during labs. It isn't exactly relative to course materials but I really appreciate this because its more fun.","Plays current music during lab!","The instructors definitely remembers things about each specific student and can make conversation about it, but usually doesn't tie into the current labs because there is really no need for that in my opinion. However, they did stress about the important in certain steps of lab like getting our soil sample in person, etc.","I think Dr. [Removed] always mentions some fascinating research going on about what we are learning and how that can be important to people in different majors. For example, when learning about the resting potential and how that is a thing that happens in neurons, she mentions how neuroscience majors might want to look a bit more into this.","Dr. [Removed] doesn't necessarily use pop culture to explain the topics. However, for example she'll use cava to explain a function in the cell","I don't exactly remmeber what she did. She tries to include images and little gifs in her canvas modules.","The instructor has ice breakers some classes and connects it back to lectures.","The professor has introduced various current issues regarding genetics and health ( such as ancestry tests, genomic profiling ) into her discussions.","Gives us questions and examples in class to answer that are relevant to us specifically or to the biology / genetics world that are of interest every lesson.","Dr. [Removed] shoes real world applications of genetics in lectures such as calico cats and shows us how what we are learning is in the world around us","Let us do after class reflection","Dr. [Removed] related genetics to diseases we might find in real life when we were talking about sex - linked traits. She talked about [Removed]'s Disease and how it happens due to nondisjunction","Dr. [Removed] once incorporated a picture of a show called [Removed]'s [Removed] to explain what central dogma means. This happened a few weeks ago.","I don't really remember","Professor [Removed] makes jokes about current things in pop culture","Dr. [Removed] tries to incorporate some sort of experiment when explaining topics. Once, she explained DNA encoding by using [Removed].","Dr. [Removed]'s slides are entertaining and she put an anime reference in her slides recently. I did not get the reference but many students did.","Unfortunately I can't recall the specifics, but there was something trending on Tiktok regarding a zoo animal, or perhaps an ocean animal, and when talking about DNA sequencing she referenced this.","During lecture, she will make references to current events or have slides that have current events and will ask us questions and tell us to talk with our group members.","Physics has a lot to do with gravity and Dr. [Removed] incorporates a lot of the moon landings in lecture.","He plays relevant videos to our learning to help us understand ideas better \n","He encouraged us to vote without making known his political affiliation. Reminded everyone to get out and vote, and reminded us that we do hard things. Recent is a relative term because we've talked so many times about past historical events when discussing current space news.","I remember him teaching us about [Removed] [Removed]. I do not remember the exact connotation though, it may have been a mentality guidance after we got our scores back.","Dr. [Removed] uses physics demonstrations to improve our understanding of the concept.","He gives us examples and shows us really cool videos related to the moon a lot like playing golf on the moon and man's first steps, etc, relating it to content and theories in class. Plus he does cool demos in class as well.","he talks about growth mindset and how it relates to the course. he mentioned [Removed] bryant after the second minterm to help with perspective","he usually shows us videos of like famous physicists and what they accomplished and how we can apply that to our lecture","Includes models and in person demonstrations to show what's happening in select problems!","The lectures always include real life applications and demos. He also references specific examples in life and hobbies to explain material which helps.","Today Dr. [Removed] mentioned creatine in class. Many students use creatine when working out for muscle growth. He explained that creatine acts like X - P.","I don't remember exactly","We were learning about glycolysis and [Removed] production and he was talking about taking creatine, which is something that is relevant in [Removed] culture with people that go to the gym. He was talking about common misconceptions and why and how it works the way it does.","The instructor made an announcement about studying abroad and any research opportunities that students may be interested in. Student's tend to be interested in these topics in the first year and the resources are very helpful. \n","I don't remember when this exactly happened, but the instructor made comparisons to the pandemic and recent diseases going around.","There was one specific example I was thinking about where he talked about the body's lack of ability to break down [Removed], which is sugar - free. [Removed] is something that's been popularized recently, and though that isn't really pop culture, it's a reference to modern trends. This helped the students be able to connect the topics learned in biology to the real world, and even their own lives. \n","He often asks if we know about something that is related to a topic we are learning \n","Talking about deer and his background","I would say the professor has made sure to express the thoughts and ideas of the class in [Removed].","During one of our [Removed] sessions, my professor referenced [Removed]. That's because things that were funny were being commented in the discussion section.","Dr. [Removed] always puts specific real world and relatable examples in his lectures. He has them in his textbooks and his lectures and make sure that they are relatable.","He uses a lot of references to help us connect to the topics he is talking about. For example, talking about the half point of the max with teaspoons of sugar.","He understands a lot of students are pre - med so he will incorporate a lot of medical examples and overall things that we can relate to. For example, epithelial cells being in the lining of the stomach, the competition where someone couldn't go to the bathroom to win a [Removed] so they got water toxification, and many more.","He will bring up random topics I'm forgetting exactly what right now but he does it fairly often.","A lot of the material that we use does not even have the chance to do so. She has accommodated our interests by giving good introductions to each lecture to make sure we have an understanding of the functions of the class.","During a worksheet to fill out during lecture, data of popular rock bands was analyzed. Many of the names were familiar. This happened today as I am filling it out.","We learn about ecological data. Use real world examples. Working with real world data on personal project for class","The overall structure of the course stays relevant to the current R code and the datasets are all of relevant info, such as volcano eruptions. This was explored 2 weeks ago.","We would look at charts of which jobs use which coding languages the most. In a class where we use R and python, we could see how useful knowledge of those languages are in the grand scheme of things such as professional jobs in various fields.","Most of the data that we work with has real word application, and for our project we are allowed to work with data that we found interesting","Uses some examples of popular music in data assignments.","She let us incorporate topics of our interest during project","When working with data, the data is representative of real world data. For the project, we are also allowed to choose a dataset based on our interests from a set of databases.","We had different topics covered that were relevant. For example, the city of [Removed] came to speak to us about their daily work lives which applies to what we are covering in class.","She provided different dataset and allow us to choose the ones we are interested in.","I feel like it was more shown in the data sets we were using. We used a [Removed] set for the hw. This happened last hw ( 5 ). I think many students can relate through personal experience and this helps with interest in grappling with the set.","Had us working on a pokemon data set for hw is an example","The professor used an example of a TV show that discussed a probability question in class. We were told to vote on what the answer would be for the question and we went over the question and got the answer explained.","-Collected data that related to students. For ex, she collected data on co - ops throughout campus and then had us analyze that data.","When going over examples in class, the professor always incorporates examples about students and the activities that college students usually do. For example, how often we exercise or if we are in relationships, etc.","The instructor has included a research project for the end of the semester that has students working individually on their own interests. She is encouraging students to think about their lives outside of school and do statistical analysis on that.","The professor mentioned popular book series. Also, they talked about music but I don't remember the artist. These were incorporated into our classwork.","The instructor connected probability to [Removed], a professional football player.","The semester project we work based on what we are interested in to apply stats to.","Many of the questions that we focus on are related to real world and modern topics.","I believe Prof. [Removed] did something like this during the first week of class when we had to answer a survey for class. Something about how tall the tower was, asking for our estimates of it.","Many examples used in class and on homework and assignments are based on popular topics and student data. We even have a whole project in which we can control what we want to research.","\n In the course, the instructor frequently incorporated group activities during class, such as problem - solving exercises or peer discussions about key concepts. For example, during one lecture, they asked students to pair up and work through a challenging example problem, stating, \" Collaborate with your neighbor to see how you would approach this problem, and then we'll discuss it as a class. \" These sessions typically occurred midway through lectures and allowed students to learn from each other's perspectives while reinforcing their understanding of the material.","Professor [Removed] asked us about movies we watched and used it to present us a data sample that we could relate to.","During class lectures, Dr. [Removed] would value the importance of her students picking their own interests for assignments. For example, the final is a project in which she allowed her students to pick their own research topic to discuss.","I do not remember i just know she has","During lecture, professor [Removed] uses examples to teach the material. Often times, these examples and practice problems relate to real world things.","She discussed videogames in class and makes stuff like that happen a lot.","I would say that this goes back all the way to the first week of class. Professor thijis made sure that we knew that ecology was a needed and expanding field throughout the [Removed] [Removed] alone. There was an entire assignment about the relevance of ecology in the workforce and its importance to the world that we live in.","She acknowledged the election and gave us an easy day in class.","I'm the beginning of the course, we were asked about what we are more excited to learn about in this course. A lot of people mentioned being interested in aquatic biomes, so she integrated information from that video response to make us enjoy the content of the course better. During class she specifically mentioned what students wanted to learn more about and then presented the slides on aquatic biomes.","During our lectures she always use current information and talks about dofferent regions","Talks about current ecological efforts","I guess the class music playlist and also telling us about the climate, weather, and biomes of our state","Our professor once asked us in an in class quiz what our favorite musics artists were so she can expose herself to what we like and what's popular right now, and incorporates that into lecture.","one time we opened the class with a question of who our favorite son artist is","When she does check in question one time she asked us what artist we listen to and we saw the classes answer in her screen","She has demonstrations. They engage the class more.","Relates the energy and force units into real life examples","In the class check - ins, the professor asked the class who their favorite artist was. This had happened a few weeks ago, and the professor told us afterward who her favorite artists were.","We have been doing this since the very beginning of the course. The first quiz questions are usually related to emotions or pop culture to get the class started.","Mentions en experiences","we do little one word check in","I can not remember a specific time, but she does incorporate collaborative activities. She also does [Removed], which I find to be very interesting.","She always asks us about our favorite artist or color or fruit.","I forgot exactly what it was but he talked about some cartoon character or something.","not sure of a specific example, but he does refer to interesting real - life or fictional examples of physics concepts","Makes jokes based off movies","Some of the physics topics explains examples that adhere to the students' interests.   For instance some of the examples/ questions asked are about topics that we are familiar with to help us better understand the problems.","[Removed], ladjnkajdnkjsdnv","[Removed]","During each prelecture, people get to share their thoughts on a topic related to the lecture.","During a lecture, we were going over some formula and the cross product came up. A student asked if we could review the cross product. Instead of giving a brief review then, the professor incorporated it into their lesson plans for a future day to include an in depth explanation of the cross product.","all good","Not exactly popular culture, but he would ask us questions that relate the physics concept with real world example","Professor included a \" meme \" in one of the lecture slides. It's not exactly a meme, more like a picture of a known funny intro to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. I've seen it in other physics forums online and I never thought I would see it in my class","Show videos of real - life situations that connect back to what we're learning","plays songs in beginning of class [Removed] talks about activites.","Dr. [Removed] makes a point to apply our class content to real life situations. She explains the physics behind cool research and day to day experiences.","She often puts physics memes at the start of lecture which I think are really cute. As well as placing more humorous and pop culture situations in example problems.   One time she used [Removed] sign to explain tension, and I thought it was funny.   It helped me remember.","It was the beginning of the semester can't remember exactly what it was.","She is just very engaging and provides us with real - world examples where we can incorporate physics.","I have personally not remembered any references to students' interests. However, to be honest, that is not something I'm necessarily looking for. I'm there to learn the content.","Dr. [Removed] did a physics demonstration using a cartoon character from a childhood tv show most students were familiar with. He asked us if we were familiar with the character and kept the room engaged during the demo.","In multiple practice problems and in the free - response question on our first midterm, there were questions relating to the [Removed] football team.","It may not be a popular culture reference, but the instructor has used multiple real - world examples that many, if not all, students have experienced or at least have some knowledge of. One example is using the \" barrel of fun \" ride at a fair or carnival for an example of forces and drawing force diagrams. The professor explained how the forces are relevant and helped to clear up confusion of why some students felt there was an \" outward \" force pulling the person backwards when in reality there is not, just gravity, Normal force, and force of static friction.","She has a playlist with all of our favorite songs. She plays it when we're in class.","We did this in a activity and added what we each liked and how we had different viewpoints of things.","I m not sure.","An example of today, in fact, she plays a playlist of music made by us, the students. Making the environment more comfortable and welcoming","General references to modern technologies as they relate to electricity and circuitry components, as well as global trneds.","The instructor has provided several connections to real world's objects that behave in ways similar to the theory discussed in class.","There are just fun moments when our professor will make a reference to something in the lecture. There isn't really a specific moment that stands out. Just some fun moments during lecture that make it enjoyable and interesting","Puts funny memes on the lecture slides.","During lecture, he sometimes makes references that make the information easier to understand.","I can't recall","During lecture time, a student mentioned how she liked figure skating and the professor discussed how physics connected with this. As well as, the professor does problems with us that use situations like sports to relate to students interests which makes it easier to learn.","I don't remember the details","On the second day of class, Professor [Removed] provided each student with a personal reflection page to include our individual interests to later be used in class. She incorporates themes of social media and real life scenarios into word problems.","Throughout the semester the instructor has used relevant locations on campus to demonstrate a physics problem, such as using the streets surrounding us as the basis for an example. This can help us engage with the problem more succinctly.","I thought I selected that this did not happen. There is no way to go back so I'm just typing sentences. Most of our references are just everyday phenomena.","The Professor gave us very applicable advice for graduate school and determining whether a career path was truly sustainable for different interests. She includes funny remarks during lectures that reference recent events or personal anecdotes.","My instructor explains organizational skills by connecting techniques to examples we would understand.","They always try to include information we can relate to to make the material fun and engaging.","Talked about the applications of smart study habits. This was during the first couple of weeks of school. The instructor wanted us to consider how creating a healthy study schedule will impact our health in the real world.","In past classes there has been music playing once we walk in that we usually all like. This gives it a very comfortable feeling to the class and he includes pop culture in most material."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

I do not remember the specifics of it.","she applies it in real life \n","The chemistry can be applicable to almost anything and this is seen when we do relevant experiments / demos during class. This happened two weeks ago and a demo is almost monthly.","I can not remember the exact experience when this occurred, but Professor [Removed] brings the real worlld application to this course. I often would find myself in class wondering what this has to do with my major and how it applies, and as if she heard my inner thoughts she has on ocasion discussed how topics we learn about are important to current events in real world chemistry.","The instructor gives us time to converse with each other about the course and provides us with real life examples on how the content applies to the real world. This happened during the first week.

For example, the different series's that contribute to an atom's wavelength and [Removed] spectrum, balmer, lyman and another. Also the different models of the atoms as they were discovered. This happened during unit 1.","professor would speak about the relationships between what's happening in the real world and the internal aspects","She would just tell us the real - world applications of chemistry, either in jobs or our daily lives.","they have done 3 demos during the semester with explosions and stuff that help us remember engage and understand","The instructor ties current class materials into stuff occuring in the real world","I am not sure.","The instructor tries to help to relate this course to the current events or edge course, however gives more popular examples rather than research or up to date findings about the topics learned","It is difficult to remember specifically, but I can remember Dr. [Removed] mentioning how certain concepts relate to things currently being developed or studied.","I don't recall this","Dr. [Removed] frequently connected course topics to current events and cutting - edge research, making the content more engaging and relevant.","In [Removed], the instructor linked the course material on chemical reactions and thermodynamics to current environmental issues, such as climate change and renewable energy. During a lecture on reaction rates, they paused to discuss how understanding these principles is crucial for developing more efficient, cleaner energy sources. The instructor said, “ These aren't just abstract concepts — this is the chemistry behind why researchers are working on sustainable fuels and why it's so urgent. ” This connection made the material feel more relevant and showed students how foundational chemistry knowledge plays a role in addressing global challenges.","She gives some demonstrations in lecture","The professor has correlated the material in class to events that are happening in the world currently. She has done plenty of times throughout the unit.","Chemistry is everywhere around us. Comparing [Removed] to concerts","Well, chemistry is all about current events. So if it were like understanding chemical bonds, it's what happens irl, and is something worth the time to fully grasp. It happened last Wednesday. And the things she talked about were metallic bonds as we were grasping ionic bonds.","There was no mention into current events, but there was some mention into research, specifically in the chemistry topics for which there is still being research done for. There was not much else. \n","Recently, Dr. [Removed] was explaining how becoming familiar with one specific concept of the chapter we are currently on was important for students entering the medical field. She then continued to describe the relevance of the curriculum to real life events in the medical field.","She just hasn't really brought up any new discoveries related to chemistry of that sort.","Our professor has explained the impact of the concepts we learn in lecture to wider scientific achievement. Because the concepts are very broadly applicable there has been a lot of linking them to general rather than specific things.","Dr. [Removed] has mentioned the evolution of [Removed] and disclaimed material of older status and that it may have changed since.","I do not remember a time this was brought up.","Always compares chemistry to how we use it in our everyday lives. She does really good at this!","Talks about the progression of chemistry [Removed].","The professor relates the contents of the course to real life aspects. Last class, this monday she asked if any of us were pre - health to further relate this content to other classes we'd be taking later in the years of undergrad.","Dr. [Removed] has helped to relate chemistry and the things we learned to the real world. She will at times mention the application of certain scientific principles.","i can't think of a specific example, but i'm pretty sure it has happened","She explained the concept of heat or work using real life examples at the first day of topic4. She said   we can imagine using intuition.","Dr [Removed] has referred to new research in fields of chemistry and the relevance to the course.","[Removed]","In a class on thermodynamics, the instructor explained the relevance of the course by discussing the real - life application of [Removed] ( [Removed] ) and entropy ( [Removed] ) changes in processes like the formation of ice and the burning of fossil fuels. This occurred during a lesson on spontaneous reactions. The instructor said, \" When water freezes into ice, [Removed] is negative because heat is released, and [Removed] is negative because the disorder decreases. \"","Explaining how this information will be useful to our learning","The professor relates course information to real - life examples.","I do not recall a specific example ; however she does perform lab experiments at the end of class.","She would talk about real world examples that have to do with the material.","The information learned in this class can be used outside the classroom within a real life setting and within the class where you take more advanced classes requiring the foundational information.","By researching bacteria in soil we are working hands on in a real world problem with the shortage of antibiotics","This bio lab is based on the research for the [Removed] [Removed] project. Thus, throughout the labs, we are kind of reminded / emphasized on the importance of the lab work we are doing.","The professor has provided articles in which mention antibiotic resistance. This is relevant to todays events.","Our research is very relevant as we are searching for bacteria that could be used as new antibiotics to assist in the wide spread antimicrobial resistance crisis.","The whole course is based off of the antibiotic resistance crisis which is a current problem that is getting worse in our world. This is discussed daily in our class since we are working to discover antibiotics that kill diseases.","The class has us do frequent research and even quizzes us on the importance of discovering new antibiotics because of the antibiotic crisis.","in the beginning of the course we were introduced to the connection to tiny earth. After that we didn't talk about the antibiotic aspect much in class.","She explained the relevance many times on how the antibiotic resistance problem is increasing. Thus, we need to find new antibiotics in the soil.","[Removed] has time after time explained how the research that we're doing with tiny earth is directly impacting the world. She explains it as we are fighting the growing issue of antimicrobial resistance by putting more effort into our soil isolates. \n","[Removed] explained to us how our research was applicable to antibiotic research.","The course is built around the antibiotic resistance crisis, and we are contributing to research on the topic.","Throughout the semester, our instructor explained how the research in this course applies to the modern day issue of antimicrobial resistance. The research we are doing in the lab can contribute to advancing research regarding antibiotic producing bacteria.","The instructor frequently reminds us that our research has real world implications and that we are trying to slow antibiotic resistance rates. Our research can be used to discover new treatments and identify new bacteria.","The instructor would discuss antibiotic resistance in the natural world and how that can affect one's immune system and body functions. The instructor would describe the real - world application of antimicrobial resistance.","Instructors described how the work we put in the lab directly impacts the success of the [Removed] [Removed] project, highlighting the importance of the work to the future. This happened during the first few weeks of the course","N / A, didn't happen","This research is applied to a real world conflict that we are addressing through [Removed] [Removed].","The whole point of our lab is to explore and be a part of cutting - edge research when it comes to the antibiotic resistance crisis. The instructor emphasizes how important our findings and discoveries are towards this goal.","We do many assignments that explain what our research in lab is doing in the outside world. We also get to see examples of what this type of research has done in the past through articles.","Tell us abt her own experiences","The basis of the course is to work with [Removed] [Removed] Network to combat the [Removed] [Removed], which is deemed to be a global crisis which refers to the growing resistance of bacteria and fungi to medication.

Just last week on Friday she had showed us a documentary about killer whales shifting their diet to otters which impacts the ecosystem.","We learned about a model that is often used to compare pathogen population with human population in medicine.","Every week Dr. [Removed] explains how what we are learning is impacted by climate change and we learn how the system is impacted by climate change and how our world is changing due to anthropogenic effects.","The instructor would explain what concepts that her current lab students are doing in real time. She would then explain how it connects to a concept in the class.","By including realistic examples, my instructor is able to explain the relevance of physics in our everyday life / current events.","We haven't really talked much about this but she does share research from her peers that is being conducted, as well as that of the TAs \n","It's just instances in which you may need a real world example, and some of those examples were real world events or things that can happen in the real world","During class, she would talk about the events going on outside before class.","He explained some of the projects he had done with pictures and diagrams of the project.","The professor connected what we were learning about in class to his research group's research. This was awesome because it helped provide a real world situation and application for these super complex and hard to grasp ideas.","The professor has done this multiple times by showing real life examples in class and explaining when we might come across them. For instance, the most recent example was with a capacitor.","He taught","When we were learning about magnetism he showed how the magnetism we were learning related to his research. He researches magnetism to for semi or super conductors ( idk remember which one ) and improving [Removed] images.","talked about his research","Professor brought up particle accelerators and how they function on the same concepts as the topics we learned in class.","During lecture, professor [Removed] was explaining how internal magnetism functioned. He then related it to his own research. I found this interesting because it allowed me to see more practical applications for what we were learning ( as opposed to a bunch of theoretical situations ).","The professor would talk about machines that would be related to the material we were going over. One example would be when he showed us a magazine showcasing a person riding a hoverboard using magnets.","He normally relates the class material we are learning to his research lab in some way","In a class ( I couldn't remember which class it is ), Dr. introduced us to inertial and non - inertial frame of references. He also mentioned the modern view of space.","I think [Removed] was talking about some research relating to physics because I have some sort of memory about it","Sometime in the past weeks, Professor [Removed] would explain how we use certain physics equations in the building of highway loops","This isn't really applicable as the class is an into and shouldn't deal with cutting edge science","When we discuss a topic Dr. [Removed] will almost always include a real life example alongside it. These include the [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] when we were initially discussing units, the leaning tower of piza for center of gravity / [Removed], and many more.","The instructor provides real world examples about the application and relevance of the material we learned in class. However, these examples are usually in the past or abstract and do not usually pertain to current events or cutting - edge research.","N / A","We have heard example from the leaning tower of piza to an object being sent into the atmosphere. This additions make the class interesting and allows me to visualize specific concepts","Last Wednesday, Dr. [Removed] gave us places where they have physics research programs. He talked about scientists who did research and encouraged us to research on what we like.","While we were learning about entropy vs temperature graphs, the instructor used real world examples. While using these examples, the professor explained how the examples are currently being researched.","When describing the concept of entropy, the instructor explained how entropy increases in the universe, and how this may be of relevance to the big bang theory, one of the most mysterious frontiers of astrophysics.","I remember Dr. [Removed] mentioning how what we were learning applies to \" unresolved questions \" in physics. This has to do something with \" statistical quantum mechanics \". He posted this in [Removed] Discussion.","An example of this is whenever the professor went more into detail with the second law of thermodynamics. This was very relevant to the idea of the heat death of the universe.","The instructor often relates things we are learning in class to things that are happening currently. For example when we learn about certain subjects she will let us know about people that are studying that subject at [Removed] currently.","The relevance of the course that relates to current events includes the basic functions and mechanism of living things in life. For instance, the instructor would provide a lecture powerpoint and readings tensure that this is going to be learnt and relate in current events or cutting edge research regarding this specific course.","She has told us it is important to learn about evolution, but other than that I am not sure ( these questions are hard to answer )","Ecology and other animal biology / behavior is mentioned in relation to real - life things that happen.","She was explaining how evolution was applicable to the future of our lives, and referred to some researchers that we have on campus that are working on evolution. This was 2 weeks ago.","Like I said previously she always includes professors at the university who are conducting research in the topic of the lecture and encourages contact for a more complete understanding and if it's a point of interest for us to research in","she offers conferences and events outside of class","Since the subject is biology, the professor always ties the lectures with research.

She gives us more than one to explore our options","This instructor is good about setting up skills and topics to world scenarios such as work force. etc. However because this is just a seminar class, there isn't much connection between current events / research and what is relevant in the course- especially since the course primarily sets us up for success on a skill based and personal level","We were discussing on how to build a schedule for the upcoming registration. This happened last week.","I don't remember","From the beginning of the term, [Removed] has reminded us of the importance of the [Removed] seminar and how it relates to our current positions. I can recall from the first day of class her informing us during lecture how the course was there to \" help with the transition from high school to college \" and answer any questions or concerns that may arise. Throughout every lecture she has made ties to current events and expressed the importance of their relation to the material. When we explored career paths, she gave us resources for career fairs and other events that were going on or coming up.","[Removed] often explains how [Removed] can be useful outside the classroom. By putting ourselves out there, we can gain valuable experience for certain careers that can be helpful for our futures.","Each class he starts with how what we're learning impacts his research that he does with a very cool graphic often of the cosmos.","One of my favorite things that Dr. [Removed] does is relate what we are learning to his own research. I love when he does this because it shows that the material we are learning is real - world applicable, and his research is just super cool in [Removed] with superconductors and telescopes, even though I don't understand all of it!","Professor [Removed] has explained how various electronics and relevant principles are used in his research. He does this at the beginning of lecture or during specific examples.

Other than that we haven't done extra research on these scientists and current events although we do many real - world problems everyday in class.","I think the topic of research has come up a couple of times.","The instructor herself is an experimental physicist so she is very clear about how this relates to the general field of physics. She lets us know about research and brings in other students from [Removed] to talk about their things. This is a very beginner course so it's tough to say that it is directly related to high - level research but she does a great job of showing us how these topics at a much higher level can be applied.","She has given some examples with regards to modern research on the topic we are seeing","They always tell us how the articles we're reading about relate to modern society, and how their relation to society may have changed over time. This means discussing trends between generations and the evolution of social norms as a society over time.","Every class, we have students presenting on the reading, and usually the student will include certain questions that ask us to connect the information in the readings to our own lives / current events. The teachers will also sometimes add their own thought and ask us to think of certain situations where the topics we are learning about have happened.","She offers relevant course material to university life. Anything she teaches on relates to current events for us because it relates to things like studying and time management.","Well as science major, science is always changing and so are the jobs so this is current."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

While I haven't heard it in class yet, I'm sure it will be mentioned this week.","On canvas there are various ways to ask questions and give feedback.","Dr [Removed] is always asking us to come to office hours, where we can speak about the course and how to improve. She is also always emailing us about time changes!","The only time I can recall the instructor \" give students an opportunity to provide feedback about various aspects of this course \" is when she mentioned this survey this past week.","We have online discussion \" [Removed] \", and I think it is very helpful for all students to revise our exams. We can post our questions on this specific link with anonymous name.","We have this thing called [Removed] discussion, and you can post questions that the TAs or Dr. [Removed] can answer, the one instance I thought of was when many students kept asking if the learning modules ( our homework ) could be posted on the same day of class and not randomly over the weekend when it was due Monday.","The professor provides many opportunities to fill out feedback surveys, as well as responding to student concerns through email, canvas, and the TAs.","I am not sure if my answer correctly classifies for this question but our professor let us know in advance about this survey, explaining the importance of completing it and also giving an incentive to the class such as extra credit.","She gave us a survey to do in the last week and told us to take it for extra credit.","Throughout certain periods of the class, the instructor allowed students to give feedback about different aspect pertaining to the course. For instance, she would sometimes ask how students prefer to receive their lecture material or what methods they believed worked best for their learning.","Within our canvas page, we have access to a discussion board where students can ask questions in hopes of getting back feedback. It is available all semester.","The instructor gives opportunities to provide feedback through surveys and through an open E - discussion on [Removed]. The [Removed] discussion can be accessed at all times and the survey was given a week or two ago. She asked us to fill out the survey about chemistry and she told us about the E - discussion at the beginning of the semester.","I believe my instructor provides a feedback survey at the end of the semester once we have completed the course.","Through the TA, they always asked us like how was the lecture and it leads to us explaining how we learned in the lecture. So we kind of give them feedback about the session / lecture.","She always gives us a time to talk every after class or just with the TAs","She gives us a thread on canvas where, anytime during the course, we can go and ask questions.","The instructor provided an online platform for students to share their concerns, critiques, and feedback on various aspects of the course. When a majority of students expressed similar concerns, the instructor addressed these issues in class and made adjustments to better align with students' needs. This approach allowed for a responsive learning environment, where student input helped shape the course.","She would encourage some students to attend office hours and ask what resources she should provide for further success. Thus making her open to feedback.","Dr. [Removed] mentioned this exact survey to allow us to express opinions on [Removed] 301. Additionally, she regularly invites students to discuss any trouble they're having with the class and potential solutions to their struggles.","My instructor has created various assignments for us to provide feedback. [Removed] is one example.","The professor allows us to speak with the TA if there is an issue","I would provide feedback about the slides we go over in class, as we rarely ever get to go through every one, even though the latter ones are just as important to our understanding of the topic. This happened for sure sometime in Unit 1 because there was a slide we failed to go over towards the end that ended up being on one of the quizzes later that week, and I got it wrong. I do not remember anything being said regarding this event.","This anonymous survey provided us with a way to provide input on the course. Otherwise, nothing else happened.","I would argue that this is an opportunity to provide feedback about various aspects in the course so.","Our professor has let us know that we have any comments, questions, or concerns we are more than welcome to bring them up with her personally or a TA. To ensure that our concerns our being heard and we are given help if needed.","The professor provides many extra credit opportunities for students to share their thoughts on the course. There are many surveys that give the student free reign to give authentic feedback useful for the professor.","She has told us in the past to do surveys like these. She has also invited us to straight up tell her about this information.","This survey is one of those instances. Also, she will ask if they don't understand something or need it to be explained again.","My instructor was good at explaining and I was able to grasp every detail of the lectures. This happened every lecture and she even was able to provide more sources for us to study. She said during lecture.","My instructor has mentioned this survey several times in class. She has emphasized how our feedback really helps the department.","These surveys are examples of it. \n","This has happened through the survey I'm taking currently, but it has happened regularly throughout the semester.","She has opened instapolls in class allowing students to give thoughts and feedback. She states how it is completely anonymous and reads through all the responses","We are require to finish learning module before participate in class for a better understand, but the professor publishes the module to close to the lecture which make student does not have enough time to plan out their schedule. So someone have ask her to publish them earlier so the students would have more time for for the modules, so they can come to class more prepare. And the professor did publish the modules much earlier so we can have time to plan out our schedule and study the module so we do not come to lecture without an understanding of the topic.","In our [Removed] Discussion page a week ago, a student asked if the instructor could post our learning modules earlier to ensure that we didn't only have one day to complete the module. A TA responded that our instructor was working on it and this week, they were posted earlier showing she took the feedback and incorporated it.","Professor [Removed] has [Removed] Discussions, which are used for asking questions about the material, but people have also used to give feedback.","During lecture there isn't much of an opportunity. However the professor has let it be known that she is open during office hours and invites students to talk to her there.","We use an application called [Removed] Discussion that allows students to ask any questions they might have, provide feedback about the course, and whatever else a student might need to communicate with a professor or TA about.","This survey is an opportunity to provide feedback","She provides incentives to complete surveys about student success. She actually hasn't yet given students to directly provide feedback however.","The professor has a system using [Removed] where we as students can ask question and have them answered by her or TAs. This gives students a platform to give and receive feedback relatively swiftly.","In this class, we have the opportunity to share our questions and answers on [Removed] Discussion. We have also had various experiences with answering questions on [Removed].","Posted an assignment that was a student survey to get opinions from other students. She used that survey to help improve the course.","I'm completing the student survey regarding this. \n","Professor will ask to fill out surveys that will then give her feedback on her teaching for the future.","On instapoll, we are given chances to explain how we are doing in the course and what we need help on. Also, we get to say the things that are working and things that are not","Through these surveys, which provide extra credit, it is suggested that students give feedback as well as the pre / post exam instapolls.","This happens about once after very test when she uses the instapoll feature in canvas to get feed back. She often asks what would we want to see in the modules of teaching that would help us do better than before.","She provides us with check - in instapolls and has told us that our opinion matters","She asks us via [Removed] on ways she could improve the course and what we can do prepare ourselves more for the unit exams.","Took time out of lecture to fill out the student success survey","Students can post suggestion on the [Removed] Discussion for the class.","she offers these surveys to allow students to give feedback on the course, stressing how helpful it is in guiding the curriculum in a way that would be better for students","During office hours and during these different surveys we are able to express our feedback. She asks what she could do better.","In this survey, we are providing the professor feedback. I can not remember a specific time when she gave us this opportunity during class.","She has sent out these surveys so we can give feeback and even though it is not in surveys if one of us reaches out to TA in regard to the teaching I have seen change in the style to try to fix it","Dr. [Removed] provides us with these surveys to share feedback regarding the course. They are helpful to identify the positive learning environment which she creates.","She highly encouraged us to complete surveys and asked us what we thought about exams and assignments.","She asked us to fill surveys out which happeend for extra credit. Also, we are free to post our opinions on [Removed] if there is anythign we would like to change. I don't remember the exact words or when it happened, but i remember she always asked for feedback in the beginning of the year when everyone was struggling.","Dr. [Removed] told us about the topic and what we would learn from it. The topic is about enthalpy and she informed us about that.","We have these surveys so that she knows what she can improve on.","With [Removed] Discussion, you can just ask any question you may have about the content or the class in general. Great resource to see other students' opinions.","Dr. [Removed] provided opportunities for student feedback through mid - semester surveys and open discussions during class. Around the halfway point, she asked, \" What's working for you in this class, and what could be improved? \" She encouraged honest input on the pacing, teaching style, and exam preparation resources, using this feedback to make adjustments that better supported students' learning. This approach allowed students to feel heard and made the course more responsive to their needs.","The professor offers many opportunities for students to provide feedback. The professor provides polls and surveys for students to fill out both during class and after class. Before releasing the poll or survey, the professor emphasizes the importance of receiving feedback and asks everyone to participate.","There is a discussion page in the canvas modules. Dr. [Removed] walked us through how to use the discussion page. She explained how it is useful in providing any feedback we have about various aspects of the course.","Students were given an opportunity to provide feedback about the course through this qualtrics survey. The instructor has not explicitly stated this exact statement, but this survey would give students the opportunity to provide feedback about their experiences this far.","My professor has consistently told us that she has opportunities for office hours to talk to her about anything regarding the course or anything that may or may not need changing to guarantee student success. She has also given out surveys asking what our next steps are regarding chemistry and has told us that she cares about our feedback and improving the course.","During office hours. \n\n","Before getting into the lecture, the instructor told us that there was an extra credit opportunity if we submitted feedback in this very form.","We have had a few surveys throughout the year already such as this one where we can give feedback on what worked for us in the class and what did not, as well as what we liked. After the tests, in particular, Dr. [Removed] usually asks if there was anything that could have gone better and removes certain questions that a lot of students missed.","The instructor uses an [Removed] discussion page where students can ask questions about anything pertaining to the course, whether it's over lecture, homework problems, or supplies needed for class. Responses to questions are relatively quick, whether its by a TA or the professor.","Dr. [Removed] allows us peers to provide feedback through these surveys. These surveys are extremely helpful in determining how helpful this course is.","We have a program called \" [Removed] \" attached to the course where we can submit concerns / questions. There have been times when frequently asked / requested information has been addressed during lecture. One of these times, our respondus test browser was not functioning correctly for some students, so it was addressed during the lecture ( she talked us through what applies to each of us if we had an [Removed] or computer ).","she told us to take this survey","I can not think of a time where feedback was provided.","We have an [Removed] page for this course, which is always open for students to ask questions and provide feedback about the course's style and content. Students had asked for homework to be posted earlier so we would have more time to work on it, and Dr. [Removed] responded to this and has been posting the homework earlier now.","She does post surveys, but they are not frequent enough to be a consistent back and forth between me and the teacher. This is not to say she does not communicate, we are able to email her and create [Removed] discussions, but it is to say that during class there is very few instances of back and forth feedback.","Whenever there is something we don't quite understand, she will go over it a few more times, then after the TAs will help","In the very first class, the instructor asked for few volunteers to participate in an experiment. The volunteers applied fire to the balloons with different gas inside. The ballons popped and made a loud sound, however, it burned in different colors.","She allows us to comment [Removed] discussions about any course material. Here, we are able to ask any questions or comments we have on the material and get a response.","She invited the students to attend office hours so they could have a chance to talk about what we are currently learning. I assume you can talk about the teaching in office hours.","In my course, the instructor gave students the chance to provide feedback through an online survey outside of class. The survey allowed us to share our thoughts on different aspects of the course, such as the material and the teaching approach. After collecting the feedback, the instructor briefly addressed it, noting that our input would help improve the course experience.","The instructor has provided us with extra credit opportunities through forms like this. She just told us to finish the survey by the due date in order to get credit. This happened in the past week, after our first exam.","It comes up naturally when she asks if we have any questions about the topic we're covering in the lecture. It is added on at the end of class as well, and is made abundantly clear if we have any questions or feedback to communicate that through [Removed] Discussion, emails, office hours, etc,","She gives us learning modules to do that can help us get an understanding of what is going on. Also the lecture material helps a little too, but sometimes she can go too fast during the lecture and I can lose track sometimes.","Again this was briefly last week when she wanted to hear our experience through this survey itself.","After we finish a unit, Dr. [Removed] will open an instapoll to allow us to give us feedback on what works in the class and certain resources that are useful. She also gives us an opportunity to reflect on the material and our study habits.","We were encouraged to fill out this survey.","We filled out a [Removed] insta poll. It happened last week and nothing has been said since","We do surveys from time to time where we give feedback about various aspects of the course, such as the resources available, homework, etc.","Asked me my thoughts in office hours.","She allows us to do surveys about how we feel.","She uses feedback forms and instapolls after tests to record information on what we need to improve and how we can improve.","She has released multiple surveys. That's kinda the same as asking for feedback.","We have a discussion website ( [Removed] ) where students can ask any questions they have about a certain topic, technical difficulties, or simply clarification. It can either be anonymous or known, and a TA, professor, or other classmates are able to answer the questions. This chat is convenient, in which it's available 24/7.","We collaborated every day","My professor provides a link to an [Removed] discussion thread where students can ask questions and she will reply \n","On canvas, the class has an [Removed] discussion section where students can ask questions that are answered by the TA's or Professor [Removed]. Students can also give feedback on the class.","When we fill out the forms this is our form of feedback \n","I would say during office hours and surveys like these we are able to review. This happens every few weeks and she asks for review.","I believe this survey in itself is an incentive from our professor to provide feedback. We are given extra credit for doing these and it calls us to consider what we do in class.","Promotes and incentivizes us to complete surveys such as this one. Makes sure she creates instapolls when she wants feedback on how feel feel about content or after an exam.","An example of this is this survey. These ask for our inputs and give us a chance to express our concerns.","The instructor has given a success survey like this.","[Removed] instapolls","through these surveys","She has asked up to complete polls about how we feel with the course material. She also stays after class to speak with us.","After we took the first exam, the instructor asked us to feel a feedback form for the first exam. This form was supposed to help us study better for the next exam.","N / a","[Removed] allows us to research our own bacteria that we find interesting. She also allows us to ask questions about the course","Our instructor of record Dr. [Removed] came to our lab section and invited us to attend her office hours and tell her about our experience in the class. She also requested that we take this survey.","This is an example of that.","People were struggling with the 5 pm deadline for our assignments, so she listened and changed it to be due at midnight.","Whenever the lab for the day ended in uncertainty, the instructor would occasionally suggest we contact them if we encountered any issues with completing our work. This is the closest scenario I can think of similar to requesting feedback from us.","This survey is an example of providing feedback for the course.","The instructor has briefly stated something along these lines during the first week of labs. In addition,   my TA has taken up recommendations by students to make this course more enjoyable and expressive through allowing students to give music recommendations for the lab.","i can't remember","Surveys like this one and openness / availability from lecturers.","Today during lab our instructor asked my partner and me how we felt about the quiz. She asked if the questions were too easy or too hard.","I think the only opportunity for feedback would be anytime. TAs and professor don't necessarily say for us students to give them feedback but I think a lot of us students have questions and concerns and are open to asking the person in charge. One thing that a lot of the students were a little bothered about was that some of the assignments were due at random or earlier times and we students depending on what we have going on in our day whether its work or going back and and not being near a computer we would not have time to finish the assignment or would have to rush to get it done. This was told to professor and it was fixed which we students appreciate. This was recently.","She has told us about feedback surveys and course evaluationsm","[Removed] always ask for feedback during her classes. She is very open to new suggestion, new music to add during lab. She is extremely sweet and one of the best TA I have ever had.","When sending this feedback form, Dr. [Removed] gave students a chance to give their feedback on the course and things we would want to change.","This exact survey and the announcement that came before the survey demonstrated this.","The instructor provided students with this survey to gauge students' opinions about the course thus far.","I don't recall a specific moment during this course where our instructor gave an opportunity to provide feedback. However, I know there have been instances, such as this survey, where we can voice our concerns and opinions openly about the structure for this lab. I feel heard when I have a concern if that's beneficial.","Incentivizes students to give feedback on the course through surveys.","We have the opportunity to do course surveys pretty often \n","Discussion during lab","The instructor provided multiple opportunities for feedback by sharing online surveys at the end of each module, allowing us to comment on the material, teaching methods, and overall course experience. This approach made us feel heard and helped shape the course to better fit student needs.","These surveys. \n","She would do a good job explaining the procedures and making it simple","Once again, I can not recall specific instances, but the instructor sent out a survey awhile back and that was a space for us to give feedback","The instructors mention how office hours are a good way to provide any feedback or concerns about the course. It is very encouraged.","Basically, students emailed about assignments being due at 5 pm being rather inconvenient. With this in mind, the teacher changed the assigned due date to 11:59 pm.","Midway through the semester, the instructor gave us an anonymous feedback form to share our thoughts on the course structure, lab activities, and overall experience. Before distributing the form, the instructor said, “ Your feedback is important for making this course better, so please be honest and specific about what's working and what isn't. ” This created a space where we felt comfortable expressing both positive and constructive feedback, knowing it would be used to improve the course.","The TA would ask us if how she is describing something makes sense to us. this gives us an opportunity to share what we think","Although the assignments won't change I think the professor takes into consideration the students. Recently she changed the time assignments are due because enough students ask.","I would say that the quizzes are a bit stressful. I would also recommend more fun being brought into the class, with learning about cool things that are possible with what we learn.","Our lab TA is very involved during lab and walks around the tables talking to students each class.

For instance, many students discussed inconveniences with the due date time being 5:00 PM, so Dr. [Removed] changed the due date for assignments to be 11:59 PM. This is very indicative that Dr. [Removed] listens to her students and the feedback students provide for the course structure.","This survey is the perfect example as I am reflecting about the course so far and can give my feedback. It's perfect timing as we are about halfway through with the course.","Like I said in a previous answer she is very open to new ideas and to see what is more beneficial to us both for our research and grade in the class.","n / a","I believe she was explaining something to us and after she finished explaining she asked if the explanation was good or if she should do it another way. We told the TA is was good the first time, so she didn't have to change anything.","she learns from first labs of the week and sees how processes can be improved / more efficient. She also remembers questions students ask to make sure the next class understands \n","if we had questions concerning the course we were always welcomed to ask","Taking input from the students on the quizzes making sure that it was on - par with everyone and nothing was extremely difficult.","Dr. [Removed] has asked us already to write down our experiences in the class thus far and also given us the link to this survey so that we may fill it out.","At either the beginning or end of class, we are allowed to ask her questions ( or alternatively, and preferred by the teacher, just email the teacher ). During in class discussions, she answers questions related to the problem at hand to clear misunderstandings.","The instructor asks for feedback during class ( if we understand the material ) and always ensures we have a firm grasp on the material during office hours.","Our instructor has given us the opportunity to take a survey on the course to give feedback.

This helps us understand what areas students struggle with.","This survey is a great example of this. Dr. [Removed] also checks for our coding understanding through instapolls by asking how we feel about the coding material so far.","The instructor encourages students to ask for help and vocalize when aspects of the course are unclear. She is providing multiple feedback opportunities this semester including these [Removed] surveys, canvas questionnaires, and the university end - of - year survey.","This [Removed] survey is a an example as it is an incentive for us to complete for a grade.

This for example, is one way that us students are able to give feedback about some parts of the course.","He'll often ask question and ask of us to state where we feel confused. This is during instapolls or lectures."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

The instructor stressed the importance of completing this survey.","n / a \n","This was a chemistry course and in the first few weeks the professor discussed the importance of sharing feedback. She said it helps her make her course better for her students","This happened at the beginning of all of her lectures, where she said that \" the feedback you students give is crucial to help me adjust my course to fit the needs of y all \". This gave the students a voice that could be seemed as impactful and good.","This survey and another was recommended and ( although they are anonymous ) I thought that applied to the instructor placing an importance on collecting student feedback.","Dr. [Removed] and her TAs continuously ask students to post any questions they have about the course in the [Removed]. Much of the class has been struggling on the recent bonding unit, so she made the opportunity to state how feedback could better help teach the class.","Well this survey is giving feedback. However, she does ask in class on occasion to whether the way she is teaching or the speed she is teaching at helpful.","She told us to do the surveys that come out and has expressed that she does go back and regrade exams and see how students do, adding curve points if we all missed something or she felt as if she didn't teach it enough.","She always asks whether or not to move on. When we say no, she gives a quick overview about the topic","Our teacher created an [Removed] discussion for our entire class to ask important questions and provide feedback on certain topics they struggled to understand. This happened at the beginning of the semester.","She emphasized that we should take this survey. I feel like this is probably the only time, but I'm not sure.","Dr. [Removed] stated the importance of the student success survey.","My instructor emphasized that we should all be participating within the survey and stressed that it was very important information for the univestity.","When we finish topics and she gets the grades back on any exams and quizzes she will ask of we have any questions and any ways we could learn things differently to help with understanding. She also does instapolls and ask which question type we have the most difficulty with and will do an example of the board.","Through different feedback forms like this \n","The instructor offered extra credit for this survey.","The teacher let us do this survey for extra credit. She told us that it was important to do this survey so we could help improve the course.","In the time leading up to the feedback survey, the instructor would state the importance of getting the students feedback. Ensuring it helps the path of the course for time afterwards, paving the way for improvement.","My instructor mentioned 2 surveys ( including this one ) and told us that it was for course feedback and that it would be for extra credit. Both times, she mentioned it before class started on her announcements slide that she has at the start of every lecture, and then reminded us again at the end of class.","She has a discussion place where students can post questions for various issues or really anything. To me this is valuable as it collects information then provides for the student so they are able to resolve their issue.","She stresses the importance of this right before she offers these surveys and before the survey closes. She also stresses how this is a learning university and the teachers are trying to learn [Removed].","During the semester, the instructor would ask for how everyone is feeling about concepts. This was done through instapoll.","She'll ask us after exams how we felt and if there is anything she can do to improve.","We had a survey the other day where we talked about our experience in the class.","We have this thing called [Removed] [Removed] and one day in class Dr. [Removed] asked us if we could respond to one regarding our past test, she talked about how this helps her and the teaching team better support and prepare us for our assignments and studying for the test.","The professor mentioned feedback in the beginning of the class stating that its good for instructors to know where the pitfalls are about their lectures or about the content. The professor said that taking this survey or bringing feedback to them is critical for making the class better for coming students.","The learning modules were not posted before class so students had a limited time to complete them. Taking this into consideration, the professor now posts all of them at the beginning of each unit.","She has explained how student feedback is important in structuring the lecture material and the study resources. This conversation has occurred multiple times before the start of lecture.","Encouraged us to complete a survey to provide feedback on the course. This was earlier in the year","During class, Dr. [Removed] encouraged us to take this survey to make sure improvements are made to the course. She is also in the lookout for any feedback about typos or incorrect information presented in the learning modules and quicky lets the class know about any changes made.","I mean she put out the survey","The professor said that changes were made in the [Removed] and [Removed] / M classes in order to be more successful and this meant taking the corresponding labs at the same time as the lectures. Also, the professor tells us that we can provide feedback or ask questions in [Removed], and the TAs and professor are always very good about responding.","I believe this happened this past Monday where Dr. [Removed] was going over Exam results and asked us how we felt, but she just wanted a brief head nod or thumbs up.","She would inform us about upcoming office hours she hosts where we can discuss what we think about the course and how it can be improved.","From what I know, and I could be wrong, I don't remember her wanting feedback on the course besides this survey.","She would ask us to post on the [Removed] discussion board any questions we had about content, the syllabus, or any general questions. The idea being her or the TAs would respond, not necessarily changing the way that she taught, but allowing for feedback and the ability for her to respond.","Dr. [Removed] mentioned on the first day that she was a part of a research initiative on how to better engage students and teach them better. I don't exactly remember what she said, but I know that the [Removed] department has been able to work out a cohesive curriculum that is shared by pretty much all the general [Removed] classes, which I know isn't a too common thing.","In her September 11th lecture week, she mentioned how important it is that we fill out the surveys in order for the chemistry professors to gauge what needs to be adjusted in course content.","In this course Dr. [Removed] uses [Removed] discussion to let student post comment about the trouble they are having with the course or if they are stuck on a problem they can't understand. It lets the TA's and the professor know if anything is wrong with the course too.","At the end of each class Dr. [Removed] tells us to keep our feedback for the [Removed] Discussion which is basically a [Removed] section. She said that [Removed] is a resource that we should study and could help out success.","She gives us surveys sometimes. She also allows us to raise our hands and ask questions or speak.","Professor [Removed] has mentioned a few times this semester that she values our feedback and that we can submit our concerns through [Removed] Discussion or email.","My instructor has stated this when talking about completing these surveys. This happened over a week ago, towards the end of September.","Prior to this survey, she had mentioned that the survey allows her to improve the class and better connect with students.","Dr. [Removed] often uses exams as a form of receiving student feedback. After each exam, she and her teaching team will analyze student responses and reevaluate the fairness of the questions she put on the exam.","I haven't really seen that before which is why I put slightly certain.","Dr. [Removed] uses ed discussion to allow for students to provide feedback for the course and ask questions as needed. [Removed] can be answered by Dr. [Removed] or any of the TAs for the course. She mentions [Removed] discussion in every lecture.","The instructor provided access to surveys that allow her to gauge how the students feel about the class / content.","Dr. [Removed] explains content well and uses her own analogous terms to help us understand. When we are discussing questions with our peers during lecture, however, she asks for us to let her know of any tools we as students can share with her to help other students.","There were times when she would open an instapoll after a test to see what was good and what was bad. There are also surveys that she encouraged us to take to improve the course as a whole, not just her class.","I can't remember a time this happened.","I believe she has done this before. With an instapoll she asked what was helpful to us and if there is anything she can do to improve the course.","Around the time of the first [Removed] survey Dr. [Removed] encouraged students to complete the survey, in order for her to see whether her structure of lectures were effective for students retention and understanding of the modules. Dr. [Removed] after each class always reference her TA's office hours, as well as her office hours to help students have one on one time to ask any lingering questions they feel was not covered during class.","The instructor took another poll on the what we thought about the optional exam retakes. Happened a week ago. She asked us to give our opinion on the optional exam retakes, and she will take our opinion for next semesters course","There are multiple surveys to do relating to our opinions on the course, and there is also [Removed] Discussion that allows us to ask questions but also talk about things we would want clarification on.","I don't remember anything that took an exceptional amount of time. Usually just a couple of sentences telling us that our feedback was important to them.","Dr. [Removed] encouraged us to fill out these surveys so she could learn more about her teaching. She did it because she cares about improving herself for us.","Dr. [Removed] mentioned on the first day that she was participating in a student success research project, and strongly encourages to fill out these surveys because she is interested in improving the learning experiences for the students. She also mentions what other students have found helpful in studying for previous tests, and that helped me a lot around the time of the first test because it gave me a starting point in studying for my first ever college test.","She tells us to take these surveys so she is able to make the course better for new students.","The instructor would open instapoll questions that stated how they were doing on learning the material and stated that this feedback was important. The instructor would also ask the class in person about how they felt with what they were learning and how it was taught.","They talked about how it impacts their research as well as the quality of the class.","The teacher does surveys such as these to help us understand what we need to work on and what they need to work on.","The professor has provided us with multiple opportunities to share feedback to improve this class, such as this student success survey.","Dr. [Removed] reflects on feedback she gets from peers and will at times share in class these concerns and explain how she will change her methods. \n","During class, instapolls are completed so the professor can receive feedback on how students are feeling about certain topics, tests, or assignments, in the class.","Periodically ( we have done 2 thus far ), Dr. [Removed] will start the class with an open - ended [Removed] allowing us to explain what resources we have used to study and how effective our current study methods are. After the [Removed] is over, she explained the first time that she uses our responses to help her understand which resources are helpful to us.","This survey is extra credit which shows how valuable this feedback is. She wants all of us to give the course and her feedback.","I was reminded of when we get to rate our professor's at the end of the semester. The instructor takes this feedback into consideration when teaching.","Seeing our feedback to the course would help her improve as a instructor. This was said last week","At the beginning of the course, the instructor emphasized the importance of collecting student feedback to enhance the class experience. She mentioned that feedback would help her adjust teaching methods to better meet student needs. I think she stated, \" Your feedback is valuable for improving how I teach and making sure you're getting the most out of this course. \"","She exclaims how these surveys are important for her to improve her teaching and also asks for advice to improve the general structure of the course.","Dr. [Removed] requested we fill out surveys about the class and the adjacent chem lab course. She also asked that we utilize [Removed] Discussion to give feedback and ask questions about the course.","Our teacher has made several feedback surveys ( including this one ) available and has offered extra credit to fill these out. She has reminded us before they are due.","I do not remember this occurring.","During class time, Dr. [Removed] asks the class for feedback when she is teaching a lesson. This feedback helps her make sure that the class is on her pace and understanding the lecture materials.","There is an [Removed] Discussion in which the instructor can respond to student concerns. From these feedback, they address these concerns.","Dr. [Removed] has expressed that feedback is important and that it helps improve the course. For example, multiple students asked to have the course modules posted earlier to have more time to complete them and Dr. [Removed] has done so.","We are encouraged to give feedback so It'S better for the future and we also get extra credit","The closest thing she has done is do these surveys which is feedback, but I don't know if these go to her or are used somewhere else.","She has told us to do these surveys to be able to know how to improve teaching in class. Moreover, there have been various instapolls where she asks for what we are struggling with the most.","The instructor will ask instapolls about questions we have regarding the class and has a discussion forum open","By reminding us of these surveys and offering us extra credit for completing them, Dr. [Removed] has emphasized that she wants to improve her teaching and the course for the students, so she encourages us to complete these so they can actually use the student feedback.","Over the course of the semester, our professor gives us instapolls during lecture. These Instapolls check in and ask how we are feeling toward certain topics, and if we are feeling uncertain, the professor will go more into detail at a later time.","Hosted surveys","The instructor consistently asked for feedback at various points throughout the course, often at the end of lectures or after major assignments. This openness to hearing from students made the learning experience more personalized and responsive.","She makes the student surveys extra credit, encouraging students to give their feedback. She also goes over the test questions and takes out any that did not have clear instructions.","Emphasis on why this survey is important.","Dr. [Removed] encouraged students to complete this survey to help the chemistry department. She said this during the beginning of a lecture.","Caudill will open up instapoll on how everyone felt after a midterm, how people feel on specific topics ( like today there was an instapoll on how we feel about the application / equations of thermodynamics ), and tell us about how it can help them understand where we are as students.","This happened after our unit 2 and unit 3 exams. Dr. [Removed] created an instapoll and took several minutes reading through feedback over the difficulty of the material + the applicability of course resources.","She did this recently by asking for our rating of how we were feeling about a lecture through an instapoll.","She would tell us about the surveys and why they helped her become better. She also says that she is open to hearing student feedback and these situations occurred about two weeks ago.","Well she did tell us to fill these out and she said that they use the feedback they get from them to evaluate the courses.","[Removed]","Our class had just finished a midterm, and our instructor was discussing class grades and averages ( not specifically of students ). This feedback provides information on how students are doing with the material of each topic.","In the lecture, the instructor would constantly ask questions regarding the students' current wellbeing and willingness to move on. If someone had a question, she would take the time to make sure they understood the materials.","She opens insta polls in order to get feedback on exams and topics","Dr. [Removed] has us take surveys like these and always asks for our opinions in office hours to see how she can help us study even better. This happens most classes and during office hours.","She never uses this exact verbatim but she does say how our import or feedback will help her to better explain things to the future classes. the insight we give her, will make her better prepared in the future.","For the first two units, we used to have our modules uploaded a week before they were due, however, a lot of students felt like they didn't have enough time to complete them and really understand the material. For the third unit, Dr. [Removed] uploaded all the modules ahead of time, which a lot of students found helpful. After asked if we could have this for the fourth unit as well, Dr. [Removed] agreed and uploaded all the modules ahead of time again.","no specific moment but she mentioned to finish surveys","The instructor lets the students ask questions about the class, or even just clarification for certain thing on the [Removed] Discussion, where the TA's or the professor responds.","I do not remember the exact moment before and after. I remember my instructor saying the words.","We received an email stating that there was a survey that we were encouraged to do, but not obligated. The survey is to provide feedback to better the course in the future.","The instructor has provided an optional survey as extra credit. This is to gather feedback and look at ways that the course can improve.","During the course, the instructor regularly asked for our feedback to help improve their teaching. After each lab session, they would encourage us to share what we liked or found difficult. This made us feel comfortable sharing our thoughts and knowing our opinions mattered. \n\n\n\n","She gives us details on how to be more specific and what is expected of us in out lab report. She often asking for our recommendation to improve the class.","Ask to communicate about what we think","She tells us what problems other groups have had in other sessions so we can address them.","You offered this avenue!","It is important because it allows for the course to continuously improve over the years. This is important to make an ideal class for future students.","Last lab the instructor and ta were just telling us that they would love out feedback on this course so that they can help fix it for next course","We have been provided with multiple opportunities to fill out a survey so the instructor can receive feedback. Our lab instructor also checks in with us about once a week to see how we feel about the class and if we are understanding.","They are very kind and listen to feedback. They are not understanding when it comes to [Removed] or Busy work","Dr. [Removed] allowed us to complete this survey and emphasized it was very important she hears our feedback. She wants to make sure we are doing well and she reassures us she cares about our opinions.","She has stated that feedback is very important and is used to make the class better. She asks follow up questions and told us to take the survey.","We have been asked to participate in surveys, including this one, and the instructor emphasizes the importance of our opinion for the improvement of the course.","This survey is an example of this. It was send out at the end of the semester in order to improve the following semester.","One time our instructor asked us about whether the lab protocols were helpful in understanding the lab. While some agreed, some disagreed, so the instructor decided to give a short lecture about the lab to ensure everyone understood how the lab worked.","The instructor does not collect student feedback for improving their teaching in this class.","Sent in an email, letting us complete this survey","Our instructor received a lot of requests to move the deadline back on our assignments from 5 pm on Fridays or Sundays to 11:59 because a lot of people were struggling to complete assignments on time, and our instructor listened and pushed back the deadline. This showed that she cared about us actually learning and taking the time to do our assignments instead of rushing through them.","Sending out a message asking for feedback or after taking a quiz asking students how they felt about it or what questions were confusing.","I received this survey this week to give feedback on this course. I'm assuming the teacher will use this feedback and improve the class, it seems valuable as she is offering extra credit.","When the instructor gave us this survey to fill out as a class, she mentioned that our feedback is important to ensure the course is being taught well for future classes or whether it needs improvement.","We are consistently given the opportunity to give feedback.

She told us how they have adapted to make chemistry instruction consistent across all classes and made tests come from a bank of 300 questions to deter cheating efforts and make sure students all receive the same questions / question difficulty.","This chemistry course prepared them for chemistry II because they had the right foundation. My instructor advised us that students who practice problems are more successful.","All of the chemistry departments have conjoined the chemistry curriculum allowing us to study with people from different classes. Since they've   made it universal, they have also been extremely helpful in providing us with exam preparation that's applicable to our assessments.","Made us do an insta poll asking what we would do differently to study and then read students responses out loud as they came in to help us","During office hours, we talked about how helpful it was to have a review session for the exam preparation. Hearing feedback from my peers and how they also thought it was really helpful was good to know because I thought the same.","Describe how students study and how they achieve success.","Nothing to include.","Caudill uses [Removed] Discussion where students can post feedback. Many questions are asked and thoughts given, which are responded to by TAs and Professor [Removed] takes them in to account.","The professor provides instapolls asking us how we feel about course material to gauge which topics to go over more. She also puts up extra study work if there are areas students have said they are uncertain about.","She mentioned study habits of students in the past. This was at the start of the year but I can't remember her exact words.","They said that some questions on the first exam were removed. This was because of student performance and because they went and talked to them.","Ed discussion is constantly filled with answers and the teaching team do a good job of answering and fixing mistakes in a timely manner.","The instructor looked at our exams and saw frequently missed questions and judged if they were fair or not. If they deemed them not fair they would give back points for the question \n","Didn't say much.","When we have questions we ask in [Removed] discussion \n weekly \n It allows TA and professor to answer questions the whole class can see","Instructor described how the curriculum was redesigned this semester. This happened at the beginning of the class. The instructor implied that the redesign was done in accordance with student feedback but did not explicitly say it.","Professor takes feedback and applies it.","Dr [Removed] has said that the chemistry department has made changes the past year to make the course better. I'm not sure what they based the change off of, but I assume from the reviews of former students.","Provide practice exams to go ove","At the beginning of the course she talked about how they've changed the format for [Removed] 301 based on feedback from previous years.","The rework of the chemistry curriculum and department for this fall semester was explained to us at the beginning of the course, based on the feedback from the previous years.","The professor shared what students said in office hours, and their opinions on the effectiveness of the methods and materials that are used to help the class study. The professor used this to segue into what all students in the class thought of such suggestions, using this to improve on the way study materials are sorted and organized.","Provides study advice for the course during class. Gives information on how to succeed.","I think I selected that Dr. [Removed] has not done this, but to be honest if she has, it was in the first lecture and I do not have a recollection of what she said about a former students feedback and how she changed.","At the beginning of the school year the professor shared that the entire course   itself was being restructured based on previous years of observations to maximize student success.","Professor [Removed] generally checked the [Removed] discussion posts where students will ask questions or even offer feedback. Students have consistently asked the professor to release the learning modules a couple days earlier instead up posting them the day before they're due. On 9/30, Professor [Removed] discussed the delay in which the modules were being posted late because they were being checked for errors.","When it was time for mid terms, we had a problem with the testing software on [Removed]. As a result, she changed the testing policy so we could all take the exam on our laptops instead.","I can't remember.","My professor would share students opinions on the difficulty of the units and past performances on exams. This was helpful so I know what to prepare for more","The instructor used study guides based on test questions. The professor changed rubrics and test questions based on the learning material that we covered in class. The professor was very open to change as long as it was within reason and fair for all students.","For test monitoring, we have to use [Removed] and when people using ipads were having trouble using the software on their devices, the professor worked in an efficient manner to resolve this issue. She postponed using the software and created an assignment to help this issue. We are finally starting to use the platform again but she offered help for ipad users.","She gave surveys to us and asked us on our preferences, leading to question types.","The instructor taught us the study slides and lecture notes in a very efficient way. I feel that she explained everything in a way that could be understood.","it was good","After each exam, we are allowed to complete an [Removed] that asks us to reflect on our learning process for the exam we had completed. Upon completing the [Removed], Dr. [Removed] shared some common trends she had observed in the poll and we reflected upon the students' feedback.","She asks us how we feel about different things in our unit","These are odd questions. My professor is very good at teaching and shows us everything we need.","She talked about how previously this was one of the harder units to grasp, so she encouraged methods that had high success rates with past students.","She takes in our feedback","She stated how they have used former students feedback to alter and add resources to the course.","I do not remember an occasion where there were former students sharing feedback on the course.","In the beginning of the semester our professor showed us feedback from former students and what they did based on it.","Explains to class past mistakes other classes may have done which caused negative results in the lab. Also tells us in more simpler form what we are exploring in class so we don't get confused or know clueless terms.","In the introductory course at the beginning of class. The [Removed] told us about her experience in the class and how to succeed and her advice.","She addressed other students request to moving some due dates, clearly accommodating to our needs.","I'm not sure of specifics","The only time this happened was sharing previous students posters, but to be fair that's all that's necessary.","Dr. [Removed] mentioned a group of student from one of the labs lasts semester who did discover something really interesting and valuable. Sharing their experience and feedback with us made the course seem a lot more valuable and our purpose much more clear.","They stated that previous students would come back to TA the course","I don't believe this has happened but there was a section at the start that described how student did in this coarse.","The instructor has not done anything for this.","I haven't heard anything on former students feedback","Talks about how course may be modified as it goes, showing that student feedback matters","She and the TA sometimes go into what the previous course looked like ( a final... etc ), and where a part is tricky to really pay attention ( for something on the practical )","[Removed] has been a TA for [Removed] Lab for I think 4 semesters now so she is familiar with the procedures. She always tries to make things go smoother to ensure we work at a steady pace.","I believe that the instructors took great consideration of the student's feedback into the course. For example, changing the due to date from 5 pm to [Removed] was a good change for most. Students have work and other classes that conflict with the 5 pm due date.","She stated that Dr. [Removed] loves to hear feedback from students and is willing to work with their preferences. Dr. [Removed] did this when she altered our due dates for assignments from 5:00 PM to 11:59 PM.","In the beginning of the semester there was some discussion by the TA about how the structure of the lab had changed from prior semesters / years.","Early - ish into the semester, got feedback to change due date from 5 pm or sometime still during school hours to due dates at 11:59 as well as always getting feedback from every quiz ( major - ish grade )","Gave us example posters for our project","They gave us many opportunities to gain hands on experience. While also guiding us to improve our skills.","n / a","Our teacher has given us reflections after class that allows us to provide feedback on the course. This allows us to voice our opinions about what we want to be changed.","The discussion sessions were too packed with doing both review slides and worksheets so she took out the review slides and we just started straight away on the worksheets and are free to ask questions as we need to.","This survey is an example the professor and TA value student feedback. By encouraging us to fill the survey, it shows that they care about improving the course for the future.","I think she mentioned that she looked over the surveys and liked reading about our feedback so she could improve","Through surveys and perhaps comments during student hours, peers are allowed to and may give the teachers feedback on certain aspects of the course. She has not really talked about changing stuff based on the feedback so far, but it is also fairly early in the course.","Dr. [Removed] will often tell us when students from past years struggled on a certain concept and how she's spending more time explaining it this year so that we don't struggle.","I remember sometime last month, Dr. [Removed] detailed how she made the change to focus much more on the growth mindset after a student was able to echo that exact sentiment.","Described the use of course surveys and tweaking the curriculum based on responses.","On the first day of class she shared quotes students gave about the class.","The discussion section leaders provide advice during class","She uses her past students responses and she is able to form homework and office hours to make the outcome for her future students better.","In the beginning of this course, Dr. [Removed] showed reviews of her class from people in the years previous. This helped us students know beforehand what we can do in this class to succeed.","we talked about it a little in office hours","She would state students feedback on canvas and in class","I don't remember too well however our professor discussed feedback she has received regarding the course from previous students at the beginning of the course and described tips that previous students have shared and how she reacts to this feedback. I can't remember if a specific change that the professor has made to the course was specified.","Dr. [Removed] will ask us how we feel constantly about life and the content we cover each week while trying to relate us to how her past students felt about certain topics generally.","She showed us advice written from previous courses and then shared what she currently does now to support her students.","She has had many surveys for us and reflections about goals we want to achieve in the course. I had friends in the class the year before me and know that she made changes that have made the class less stressful.","It's a lot of work, but so worth it!","After our first reflection he discussed the feedback in class","Before midterm, we took a survey. He told us he wanted some feedback.","The instructor holds reflections after exams. He also holds surveys to make sure he gets feedback. He does this weekly or after every test. He reads some of the responses and common feedback to the class to address some of the responses.","I believe that the [Removed]'s shared their experience with this physic course during the early days of class. Specifically, explaining how they studied and went about understanding the material. In addition, reassuring that everyone can learn physics.","He alwyas finds ways to improve himself.","The professor posted student feedback on canvas. He took into account what students were saying and evaluated exam question and determined that the question was not fair and gave credit.","He shared feedback from the self reflection to the class on how to have a growth mindset.","Dr. [Removed] makes sure to make time for questions in person and through [Removed] diiscussion.","He changed the grade cutoff for A from a 94 to a 92 and saw better results of people doing well in the class.","Dr. [Removed] takes surveys, or reflection assignments, to share what other students are doing to prepare for the course material.","The instructor required us to complete surveys and informed us of the results in the following lecture. \n","The only time I ember this happening was the first day of classes.","A portion of the class struggled with the second exam. Dr. [Removed] restructured to the course a bit to focus on the importance of learning the material from the exam and give the students an opportunity to meet the challenge again. \n\n He focused on growth mindset during the and after this instance","I can not recall a moment when this was done. However, the professor has given us a list of steps on how we should study for exams.","At the start of the course ( first week ), our instructor referenced his TA's and asked them to speak on their experience in the class. \n","The instructor mentioned how the course was ran for other students and told us how these students performed in his class. Most of the TAs are previous students so they can share their experiences in the class and give us tips on how to study and navigate the material. We were introduced to our TAs on the first day by our professor.","He has stated how and what to do to pass his class regardless of what the media says. He is still open to criticism and very open to the idea of a student.","After every test, Dr. [Removed] releases a form for us to fill out on what he could work on for the next unit. Since then, he has slightly added things to help us in the class, such as more practice problems.","Dr. [Removed] would often mention what other students would say. This happens throughout multiple lectures especially in the beginning of the year. This includes students comparison between AP biology and this course, etc.","Not sure","All of my friends in this class thoroughly enjoy Dr. [Removed] and his class. We have all enjoyed attending his lectures and have nothing but good things to say about him.","The professor himself has not shared student feedback, but my TA who had the professor was able to share his experience in the class. This was extremely useful information.","I think she went over these on syllabus day but I am not quite sure.","We filled a survey just like this and it led to a discussion of students thoughts. Leading to a change in the layout to help the students out.","We had a time where she had surveyed the class to get a pulse on how we felt overall, and she turned those results into a combination of reflection and a segway into the next lesson on text sentiment analysis.","A past student of this course came in to talk about her experiences in this class, specifically the project.","I know that she has used feedback from the class to adjust her labs to make them more feasible for students to finish in time in their lab session. It was very helpful to see that change and know that she is taking our opinions into consideration","gave us advice on what to do for our project s","Our instructor called a student from the past semester or batch to present their research on their project and used it to give us an idea of what to do and how to go about it. This happened in lecture.","she shared something about the project past semesters but I can't recall what it was exactly","n / a","Our TA shared his previous project in this course with us. This happened on the second week of the semester. The TA shared his experience and what he learned from the project.","She would talk about [Removed]'s previous experiences and how they liked the calss.","The instructor shared a previous students work with the class.","The TA for the course shared his previous project early in the semester. I can't think of a time beyond that.","The worksheet answers were posted in a much more timely manner.","She described how the big project was tweaked over several years, along with how past students enjoyed it and how she remembers them.","[Removed] passed out past students' advice on how to succeed in the course.","They gave us written feedback and advice from former students who took the course. We read their feedback and shared and discussed it during our first class period.","The first day when we went through what was needed to do well in the class","I believe she passed around some letters that previous students wrote to succeed in the course. She made some people read them out loud so there were a variety of answers. This happened the first week.","During the first day of class she gave us pieces of paper with advice of success from previous students that have taken her class.","I am pretty sure it was this class that passed out former student thoughts on the course and tips at the beginning of the semester.","On the first day of lecture, Dr. [Removed] shared feedback and advice from student's who took the same course previously. It was insightful to hear real advice that would help us do our best in this course.","In one of the early lectures she handed out student feedback and advice to the whole class. The professor explained how she believed that advice could be applied to the class. The change she implemented was emphasizing the importance of good strategies and usage of our resources.","At the beginning of the semester, she asked if we wanted attendance to be counted ( to be an easy grade ), but most people voted no and she catered to being more flexible. She also has a hard and soft deadline which increase the flexibility of the course.","That was the first day of class. She had reviews from other students.","She showed us some of our responses to a course survey we took after the first quiz in the class, which contained some of the struggles people were having in the course. She did not change much in terms of the structure of the course, but did share some strategies for note - taking in the class to improve, and why she structured the quizzes in the way she did.","When speaking on the final project","Our Professor helped us get understanding of other peoples experiences and the TA's experiences","When the professor recounted the best way to study. She used anecdotal data from years past and how they studied in her class.","Dr. [Removed] allowed us to work in teams because it had been shown to improve students' abilities in the class. We performed in groups pretty much every group.","Can't remember a specific moment \n","There was no feedback analysis or even feedback given, regarding past or current students' feelings on the course. I think it would be very helpful to have this implemented possibly before big tests","On the first day of the semester, professor offered former students' feedback and a guide on how to be successful. She continues to take in feedback through [Removed] discussions, surveys, office hours and is always adapting in real time, not waiting until the following semester to implement changes.","The professor has mentioned past reviews from other students. She has also mentioned dos and don't's.","The instructor made us do a survey for extra credit, collected our responses and talked through them in class.","About two weeks ago Dr. [Removed] sent out the results of the first survey she sent to us. In it she asked what we could like her to stop doing, continue doing, or start doing. After reviewing the answered she explained at the start of class what changes she was willing to make and why she would not be changing others.","I think she mentioned what the TAs thought about the course and they gave advice in discussion","Dr. [Removed] broke down the responses of a student survey she sent out for extra credit on what the students liked, what they didn't like, and what they thought she could change. She presented the findings to us and the realistic views of what she could do.","If some people tell the professor something about the structure of the class, she accommodates to the whole classroom. An example is when not everyone could take the retake exam at the time given and she offer a different time those who needed.","N / A","Dr. [Removed] took a look at the class and saw a lot of tired faces. We have a one - word check - in every class and the question for that day was \" How are you? \" and most of the class said \" tired \" or \" stressed, \" so Dr. [Removed] further inquired and asked us what happened. She found out that most of the class had just come from a [Removed] test and decided to take the day easy and we would cover the rest another day when we would be able to better retain the material.","we do feedback surveys","At the beginning of the semester she provided us with feedback of prior students and things that helped them succeed in this course.","When we gave her feedback on feeling overwhelmed during lecture, she heard us and now we get 1 to 2 minutes breaks during lectures","The professor talked about changing their note - taking style in order to have materials to provide students.","She talked about her experience in shaping the course at the beginning of the year","After exam 2, she went over the class averages. The is also free after class for students to ask questions on how to improve","Has tas","During the first class, he talked about how he has changed the exam format based on past year feedback","Not really","Will often describe problems students typically do poorly on.","gives us retakes","The entirety of this course was instrumental in providing the space for students to share their feedback on the course.","Talked about how he teaches a subject slower based on the grades.","Dr. [Removed] is always interacting with his students. You can ask questions during or after the class, or provide your own feedback, and he will definitely be open to listening. He asks for our feedback actively in class, particularly after exams to see how students felt - in order to get a feel for how students are doing in the class.","In one of the first lectures, Dr. [Removed] called on our LA's to detail their experience in the class and how they would approach the course if they were to take it again. He also allows us to share feedback on how we felt about the test, providing feedback on how to prepare for future exams.","The professor hasn't taught this specific physics course before but acknowledged that he is open to feedback. He acknowledged that some students may feel that their course's tests are completely different from homework, so he aims not to make that the way with this course.","The professor asks us for opinions on what we think of parts of the course so far since this is his first semester teaching it.","Our professor showed us grade distributions from previous years.","He makes it easy to state our feedback during class","He talks about how the past students did on the exam and how they imporved.","We would have a lot of TA's and LA's who would explain their situation. She would also tlak about their experiences and past year's examples.","at the beginning of this year, she mentioned that some of the [Removed] have taken her course and given her advice.","Our professor is always trying to find ways to improve. Every week after lectures, we submit a \" content questions \" assignment which is basically a place to put any questions we had to be addressed the following week. We are also filling out a survey so she can find ways to improve and provide the best education. She really does try her best and it is very evident.","Her TA's and [Removed]'s have taken her course, so during discussion they shared how they were successful in this course and tips [Removed] has for us.","Sometimes during class Dr. [Removed] talks about past students' experience, especially when she asks for the [Removed] to talk about their experience.","After a survey such as this one, she shares the percentages of the class and how they voted on certain things and always incentivizes completion of surveys such as these and always stresses how important our feedback is to her and the teaching team","Not exactly sure when, but Prof [Removed] has told us stories of past students who woul struggle initially with the course but were able to improve through recieving extra help outside of class.","feedback forms","Dr. [Removed] does a good job talking about students' misconceptions about physics to aid our learning","In doing this form, it is a prime example in encouraging and accepting feedback.","[Removed] would provide examples of past students and their goals to achieve good time management skills in order to adapt successfully to college life. This happened during the first couple of weeks of the semester and while she said this she was going over different ways to manage one's time efficiently.","She uses the TA as an example of how this course has helped her. She tríes to relate to everyone in order to make everyone feel welcome and provide feedback.","During class the professor went over some responses to a poll about what is or isn't working for students as far as the format of the class and difficulty of the content.","Before each lecture I've gone to, Dr. [Removed] shares thoughts and insight on the course from previous students, including what parts of the course they found challenging and which resources they found helpful. I don't recall her mentioning in what what this feedback was used to change the course, though.","Almost every class it seems starts with an old student letter that is motivating or helpful advice. Dr [Removed] definitely does this well.","Every couple of lectures, the instructor reads us a letter that a former student of theirs wrote to current students. I believe she does this to show us that former students most likely had the same challenges that we are currently having.","We have slides about it everyday","From what I remember, Professor [Removed] mentioned at the start of class one day that students had told her that the course gets progressively harder throughout the semester, but that there are built - in opportunities to make up for low or missed grades because of this."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

These unfair questions would then alter test scores.","I was able to complain about said BS questions","The instructor didn't invite students to help design materials or assignments that will be used in the current course or future courses.","We have a ed, which is basically a place to ask questions. If a student has a question, comment, or concern, they can say it on there and they are most likely addressed. There are many concerns that students brought up that the professor corrected.","In my course, I don't believe my instructor has invited us to help design course materials or assignments. They've mostly followed a set curriculum without student input on the structure or content of assignments. \n","I actually don't know but i m sure the work with the TA has","Did not happen","She called students up to participate in experiments on stage. \n","Yes she posts all the assignments so we can do before class. It helps me have a better understanding of what she is going over.","Within this course I've learned a variety of information. This has happened throughout every lecture that [Removed] has had. Words to describe my professor is patient, hardworking, and kind.","Self - studying was a big part, so it was useful","Constantly telling us about informative learning modules and videos on canvas. She tells us this constantly and it is very helpful","she asks for feedback on assignments if them are helpful or not","Daily she allows us to ask questions to better understand the topic it helps A lot.","I don't think my instructor ever asked students to contribute to materials or assignments for the current course or future courses.","I have no idea.","The instructor has not helped us design materials or assignments yet, although I believe that we may do so in the future.","Our professor has invited us to take surveys like this one to provide feedback on the course. She has also completely redesigned our curriculum this year and has expressed she is open to feedback on it. She outlined how the new curriculum is designed to help students and has taken in feedback from prior students.","On the test she asked students to come to her if their was something unfair that needed to be fixed.","When introducing new topics, she often linked them to more advanced concepts that would be covered later in the semester or in subsequent courses. She invited students to suggest specific areas of interest within those topics, which could be developed into more detailed lesson materials or assignments.","The instructor invited students to participate in designing a group project that would replace a traditional exam, allowing us to suggest topics and formats that we found engaging. This invitation typically occurred during the early weeks of the semester, and the instructor would say, \" I want your input on how we can make this project meaningful and enjoyable, so feel free to share your ideas. \" This approach fostered a collaborative atmosphere and made students feel more invested in their learning experience.","The professor had TAs from previous classes help with questions. This happens all throughout class.","She references how topics disgusted in her class could or will be used in the future or could be something from review","Professor caudill provides us examples of how to prepare for quizzes and exams such as using flash cards and taking notes.","In our Chemistry lab, Prof. [Removed] invited us to help design a new \" noise lab \" experiment focused on understanding sound and chemical reactions. This happened early in the semester when she encouraged us to brainstorm ideas for making the lab more interactive and relevant. She said, \" Think about ways we could explore sound in a chemistry context — [Removed] love to hear your ideas and maybe incorporate them into future labs. \" This approach made us feel involved and excited to contribute to the course material in a meaningful way.","Dr. [Removed] does live presentations of chemical reactions in front of the class. The experiments are always related to the course content. Dr. [Removed] usually invites 1 - 2 students to participate in front of the class.","She has TA's so I assume they would have provided input for course. She also takes student input from class that can better learning for later.","My instructor for chemistry doesn't really do this. It is rather the TA's or Dr. [Removed] herself that helps design materials or assignments.","The instructor would constantly ask for feedback and questions if we were confused. This would happen during class. During the class the instructor would ask how we felt about certain subjects or topics before moving on.","I do not think that were helped design materials or assignments.","The professor has a discussion forum, which allows students to ask and provide help to others, and acknowledging potential technical issues, which the professor takes into account and adjusts accordingly.","My professors gives us surveys to help with future courses and how to improve upon the course, using our feedback.","Instructor asks for feedback on the course.","they sisint actually dothis","These surveys for example may give here helpful input.","constantly asks for feedback","Our instructor, Dr. [Removed], asked us for suggestions for the next task halfway through the semester, adding, \" You know best what would challenge and engage you. \" Together, let's construct this. We discussed project formats, grading standards, and interesting real - world subjects in small groups. She compiled our thoughts, incorporated the best recommendations, and applied them to produce an assignment that seemed to be specifically catered to our interests. Many students reported feeling more motivated as a result of the collaborative approach, which made the lesson feel more intimate.","She gives assignments that are thought provoking and informative. It happens within and outside the class, and she is very thorough when asked questions.","We do work that contributes to The [Removed] [Removed] Network.","She always asks for our feedback after each class, which makes us comfortable with giving suggesstions for how things can run.","she always tells us how this material will be very helpful even for mcat","She allows us to provide feedback on lab procedures. For example if we discover a more efficient method to gram staining.","I mis - clicked regarding this question. I don't think [Removed] invited students to help design materials for future courses. \n","I'm not exactly sure when this happened, but my TA did ask the class to provide feedback on how different lab tasks could be performed more efficiently or better suited for the tasks to be more enjoyable.","I don't remember a specific time this happened.","Not yet happened but we are still early in the course","During one of out labs, we were instructed to design a specific method of retrieving a soil sample. This showcases how this course invites students to help design materials for the current course.","We give feedback about the experiments","A student once came in to fix a fault technical instrument used in the lab.","We've given suggestions on quizzes, added comments, fun things like that!","Dr. [Removed] at the beginning of the term asked the class to think in small groups and decide what the classroom norms should be regarding behavior, studying, and expectations regarding the course. In this class activity, she wrote down each of the class norms each group had come up with and encouraged each of us to follow them.","Dr. [Removed] encouraged us to complete surveys and responses about what types of homework or assignments have been most helpful to us. This is in the end helpful in designing future coursework.","Dr. [Removed] asks how she can improve our class for the better.","Did not make us do this.","This has not occured.","Dr. [Removed] gives us ample opportunity to provide feedback on the course to improve it for both current and future students.","Her questions require lots of critical thinking","Dr. [Removed] often asks for feedback on most assignments to alter them for future courses.","Dr. [Removed] asked us to build our class norms on the first day of lecture. We then generated our class structure and still adhere to our norms.","I don't remember this happening","I absolutely love Dr. [Removed], she is one of my favorite professors. She made a lab where we did statistical analysis relating to genetics which I felt helped me understand the genetics material and learn more about statistics.","She asks for feedback and we talk during discussions","It didn't happen","Allows us to provide feedback on tests and homeworks.","I don't think she did this explicitly","The professor asks students questions about how HW or tests are and is flexible with it.","We have assignments called reflections. I think these are good invitations for students to figure out what they would change about the class.","I don't recall doing this.","In our course, the instructor engaged us in a discussion about the moon's physics and how these principles apply to our everyday lives. By highlighting real - world connections, the instructor encouraged us to think critically about how physics shapes our understanding of the universe and our daily experiences.","The instructor has never done this.","he lets us write on ed discussions any concern we have and has so many office hours","Asks us what we think about materials and assignments","Instead of assignments, the professor talks with us about ways we can improve in the course and helps us brainstorm ways we can be successful. One instance of this was when he asked us to do a survey about things we thought we had control over and things we didn't when it comes to our grade in the course. Then we discussed our answers in class.","Our instructor has not done this","Took feedback from students. This can help future students.","Professor has clearly outlines what the main topics of the course are and emphasized to what extent we need to know them for this class.","I was thinking of this survey that I am taking right now.","we did study skills fo where we reflect on the previous exams we did so after each test we would fill out this form and think about what we could do better on the next exam","The reason I said I think my professor has invited student to help design materials that could be used in the current or future courses is because after our first exam, he went through the answers and shows us all the percent of the class that got certain questions right or wrong. He encouraged us to appeal if we got a question wrong but we believe that we got it right, so I thought it could apply to this scenario where if enough people appealed on a certain question, the question could be worded differently or changed in the future.","In discussion sections, Dr. [Removed] encourages us to write our own questions in order to further understand material. He also stresses the use of doing work on your own such as other worksheets outside of class.","He asks for our opinion","She has not done this","This didn't happen much.","I don't remember her doing this, but maybe it is the course project.","In Dr. [Removed]'s stats course, she invited us to collaborate on creating solutions for problems for future data expectations such as those in [Removed], etc. ” This made us feel involved and related with our the setting around us, and it allowed us to think deeply about the material from a teaching perspective, improving our understanding. \n\n\n\n\n","Professor [Removed] listened to the students' feedback and shortened the lab material after realizing it is too time consuming to be completed in an hour. Moreover, she was always open to feedback regarding the materials, whether it be the project or the lab, and answered any arising questions via [Removed] Discussion.","She has asked if the worksheets are understandable and ensures that they could serve us the most benefit.","We have a project that we work on for the entire semester","Gives us surveys to convey our thoughts","The professor actively engages with students to learn how to improve the coursework and make it challenging and fair.","I meant to put no","She would ask for input on the course","She actively encourages students to analyze data they are interested in. In this, she expresses that, \" the material can be thought of a bigger project that contributes to society ( Here in [Removed] ) or even subsequent classes. \"","Responded well to the feedback about the labs which made them more doable and a better learning a experience compared to the start of the semester.","Dr. [Removed] will take our feedback into planning future assignments. Every question a students asks is a way for her of inviting students to help design materials for future courses.","I can't remember an exact time.","N / A","Our final exam is a project that you can decide what your variables are and what exactly you want to study. She asked us to do said project on something that we are passionate in, without putting a lengthy cumulative final as she knows we are stressed about other classes. This is very rare for a professor and very appreciated.","Students gave feedback on the course to other students, and ta's contributed to the materials and assignments","There is a project due at the end of the semester. It is a research project in where you ask a research question and use what you learned in class to determine an answer.","I guess when we often turn in our pre - labs, which are then used to be the building block or used to create our lab assignments.","Has asked students to fill out surveys regarding future improvements to the course.","We did a survey at the begining of the year that we still use for class examples.","Not really sure if this happened","We were able to edit an equation sheet for our midterms.","She took a canvas survey where she asked specific questions. After people to the survey she compiled all our responses and showed us her feedback.","She sent out a survey asking us what she does that we want her to stop doing. And in that same survey asked what we would like to see implemented into the course. If there are assignments, hw, or something that can help us in class, she would implement that.","We've taken multiple surveys throughout the semester asking us what changes could be made to the class in order to help benefit us.","The instructor works with TAs and UGTAs to come up with discussion sections","Dr. [Removed] listens to our feedback about what we like / dislike about the course during semester surveys. She also likes us to give her feedback on exam format and project outlines at the end of every project.","She gives us opportunities to provide feedback. Based on what the majority of us suggest, she will pick some ideas she agrees with and implements them into the class. She explained in detail today what she specifically changed.","She allows us to give feedback about the work we complete! We also do projects that could benefit students who may take the class in the future.","Students were asked about muddy points from the lectures of the week, so that the instructor can further clarify the concepts.","I mean just throughout the coursse the professor would share personal experiences and give examples, also live demonstration","The professor has made it a very safe and comfortable environment, so students are able to say their opinions and ideas freely.","Dr. [Removed] asks the class biweekly(approximately ) about what class resources we are using and finding to be helpful and what other resources we may need in order to be successful.","She is open to receiving feedback from students, such as recording a review session when many students mentioned they have lab during that time.","I usually think about how Dr. [Removed] will set up experiments for the lectures and you, a student, to demonstrate. It's just cool to see the demonstration using a student. This happened this past week with a student hopping on a chair with weights and as she put her arms closer to her body, she would spin fast.","N / a","he invited students to make problems for the class. this would also result in extra credit","Professor [Removed] invites to reflect on how the assignments and discussion sections are passing in an effort to see if changes are necessary. He also has students set up his experiments.","I just say that it might be true just because there is a chance that he might have had a student help him set up a demo in class. Also, he structures his lectures that are geared to typically answer students questions.","This is his first time teaching physics 1 so he takes in our feedback alot","We are able to ask questions that may be included in future teaching material","We can create a research question to work on throughout the semester to help use what we are learning to work on it.","Does feedback, ask questions on what is confusing on every presentation, and promotes doing evaluations","The professor posts weekly content questions, in which we put a questions that we are not certain about. This may be a question that others have had as well, so she is able to collect them. We then go over these questions in discussion.","There have been multiple instances. One instance includes when we were asked to come up with a quiz - like question. This allows students to see how other people in the class are challenging themselves. After this happened she encourages us to look at responses.","I think surveys like these and our ability to voice our opinion, especially with the course evaluation, will allow students to improve this course for the future. Also, I feel like this can be expressed with the quiz reflections. \n\n\n","No we don't do assignments like that in this class","We are often asked to provide information on our experience this semester.","n / A","Mid way through this course we would submit feedback survey on what to add to this class or [Removed] would ask us our opinions on how things are done and hot to improve them for future classes.","Dr. [Removed] asks us for our feedback in the assignments and how we felt about any lectures or resources she tries to provide for us."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

The system is effective, generally, and keeps you on it.","We use instapoll in every class after going over a topic. It helps test our immediate understanding of what we learned and it increases our confidence.","[Removed] is utilized, but I do not believe it was used in the last week","Various questions asked through [Removed], some about actual content, a few about reflecting on our study strategies","About once per lecture, she sends out an [Removed] on [Removed] which is one question that we need to answer that relates to what we just learned that day.

I'd say it's been pretty helpful in learning about material in the course, especially since it's low stakes","Everyday during class we answer questions through squarecap.","the professor gives us time to work with our peers in solving quiz questions","During class, she uses squarecap in order to ask the class questions","We use an app called [Removed] where the professor asks us in class questions related to the material, or will ask us how we are feeling and we'll respond on [Removed]","every class she asks questions about the concepts we are learning and uses squarecap","Every class we do in class quizzes that we see the question on the screen and on our screens. We do the questions and answer them on the website.","Every class students are to answer in - class quiz questions through [Removed]. This poling method is used as a grade and also helps her to see if we are understanding the topic we are learning in class.","Through square cap the class will answer questions that are presented. This happens multiple times in each class. She will always tell us to \" talk to our neighbor and then answer the poll \"","[Removed] every [Removed] and Thurs","We have graded in class quizzes which focus on reinforcing the material we are learning.","Every lecture we have to answer several questions with the instapoll. he helps us get the right answer by guiding us to the right thought process","Everyday we have a few instapolls to \" check - in \" on our understanding of lecture.","We do instapolls every day. They consist of theoretical questions on the course, and he even tells us to talk to our peers about them.","When learning new stuff, he will send out little quiz questions to test our understanding","About four times during every lecture, the professor will put a question up on the board and we will use instapoll to answer. He gives multiple hints verbally throughout the question to ensure most will be able to answer correctly.","Multiple online polls daily of fundamental material to make sure we understand it.","We use instapoll in class. The professor will send out a question to the class through instapoll and we have to respond within a certain time. He will do this 3 - 7 times a class.","We answer check up questions every class to understand material being taught","He conducts instapolls and allows us to work in groups to solve them","Part of the grade are instapolls with a small physics problem and answers. You get to submit your answer and he often says what the percentage of people that got it right after he closes the poll.","Every class, he will send out [Removed] with questions about the material. Sometimes these are at the beginning of the class and have to do with last class's materials and sometimes they are in the middle of class and have to do with the current material.","Every class there is are instapolls with questions based on what we are learning in class. They are counted towards are final grade.","He takes insta polls almost every day of class. They're questions based off the lecture.","The professor would have open squarecap questions for us to answer during and throughout class. None were graded for accuracy but for participation.","Each day we have multiple squarecap questions, which are practice to answering our physics concepts. He then asks people to explain and goes over the answers.","He uses expert TA and squarecap in order to get real time responses every class.","We answered questions on a polling site called [Removed]. This typically happens at the beginning of class, but sometimes will happen again later in class.","Attendance is counted by participation in online questions posted throughout the lecture. They have a time limit, but accuracy is not recorded.","We answer questions on square cap which is just a method of polling. He does this usually at the beginning of each class and as the class progresses. He writes each question on the presentation and we answer on the square cap, and each question ties in to what were currently going over.","We do this in class every single day while discussing the squarecap attendance question with the people sitting around us.","Professor [Removed] uses [Removed] every class to ask 1 - 2 questions to the class through polling. He then explains the answer to the question after everyone has responded.","Every day in class we have questions that everyone answers for participation points, and they're either based off of what we learned last lecture or what our prelecture worksheet was about.","We use squarecap every class in order to answer questions related to the chapter we read before the class.","we answer squarecap questions every class and work through the questions with our friends.","Every class, we do at least one ( usually more ) square cap questions. The first one will relate to a reading we did prior to class, and following questions will relate to something we talked about in class. We answer these questions with people around us.","We did an instapoll to answer questions during lecture. One instapoll we wrote about our goals for the class.","We use instapoll in class for certain question in lecture, usually around understanding of the information we went over and if any parts confused us.","We would have instapolls to answer questions asked to test our knowledge.","We often use [Removed] [Removed]. This is normally at the end of each lecture we either say how we are feeling or answer a few questions about the content.","Dr. [Removed] uses instapolls frequently in our lectures to help us practice applying the course material.","Dr. [Removed] usually likes to add practice questions that are formatted to be similar to the questions you may see on the quizzes and exams. These questions are either answered by a showing on your fingers which answer [Removed] ) you think are correct ( happens more frequently ) or through [Removed], in which the question is displayed on your screen and you pick the answer you think is best with the results being shown anonymously by the professor ( less frequent ). These practice questions are included during each lecture, but the most recent date that I remember this happening is November 7, 2024 during our lecture on [Removed] growth model.","We have instapolls in class to practice questions.","My instructor regularly publishes instapolls in class time with practice questions.","The instructor regularly sendout [Removed] questions during class. These questions are relevant to the physics material we are learning in class. There is an average of 0 - 2 [Removed] questions per lecture. The instructor lets us know when these polls need to be answered.","The instructor send instapolls for us to answer for attendance and extra credit, requiring us to participate and get the answer right.","My professor uses instapolls. This requires us to answer physics problems in class and she discusses the correct answer afterwards.","Sometimes during some lectures the instructor would interact with students by providing simple example problems for students to work through to solidify understanding","The instructor regularly sends out Instapolls in the class. These happen around 0 to 3 times per any given lecture. The instructor makes it clear when a poll is being sent out by verbalizing a poll will be send out and that we will have 2 - 3 minutes to complete it.","We do instapolls around every other lecture. They are very helpful for reviewing the content.","They simply asked a student to share their thoughts on a questioned and implored their peers to comment and respond to it.","We use instapoll and do practice problems that we answer online.","He use [Removed].","Squarecap","We have a [Removed] session every class to answer 2 - 3ish questions about the topic that day. He shares the estimated percentage of students choosing certain answer choices, and goes through how they got those answers through calling on students.","Every class session there are a series of squarecap questions given to assess how well we understand the content we are currently learning. These are mainly for participation with only part of the points counting towards whether the question was answered correctly or not. This allows us to apply what we had just learned to a question with more focus on us understanding the topic rather than getting the correct answer.","The instructor would post a squarecap about 2 - 3 times a lecture and then get us to discuss it with partners for a couple minutes. Then we would choose an answer and the professor would break down the problem.","We do squarecap every single class with at least 2 questions every lecture, consisting of participation grade and accuracy grade.","Dr. [Removed] uses [Removed] to ask the class questions about the material we are learning that day. For example, he gave us a problem asking about a situation in which a person in an elevator while standing on a scale.","In this class, we use squarecaps to poll the under of the class. in doing so he would give us time to think, submit our own responses and then go over it together as a class.","We use squarecap to answer questions and assess what the class said in the majority and address why any large percentage of the class chose incorrect answers. This happens everyday and Dr. [Removed] always reinforces and reassures correct and incorrect answers to help us answer future similar questions.","The instructor did sqaurecap questions during class and did multiple each class day and would let us know when it would happen and was discussed after.","During class they always explain problems multiple ways.","He walks through lesson and then with what we learn we are able to answer questions through polls and talk to our peers to solve it.","[Removed] always wants our feedback. She makes us communicate.","She asks us how we are feeling each week and asks us to pick from a set of pictures.","The instructor make activities to know how we are. To get know each other.","Lecturer does icebreakers at the beginning of every seminar. Some i've breakers start with a hand raise poll.","Towards the end of each, or almost each, class session, the professor puts up a question related to that day's lesson and has students answer through [Removed]. Students are encouraged to collaborate with each other to come up with an answer. The professor afterward asks students to explain what answer they picked and why. The professor will ensure that the question and correct answer is explained, either through a student answering, or the professor explaining himself.","For many of the classes, questions were asked through instapoll. This happens throughout the entire semester.","Every lecture professor [Removed] takes an instapoll via [Removed] to see where students are on course material. In doing this poll he encourages us to talk with students around us and get in small groups and then asks for anyone to try and explain the answer.","We use instapolls frequently in class. Professor [Removed] will check our conceptual knowledge with weekly instapolls.","The professor presents a question for students to think about and then engages them in a discussion by asking for raised hands to share their answers. At the same time, the professor shows concern for each student's thoughts and their level of focus during the class.","The instructor uses [Removed] instapoll to collect answers from students typically during the class period to make sure students attend the lecture and are on the right track.","The professor doesn't really use polling question answering though uses polling to answer more anecdotal approaches to physics as attendance credit.","We do instapoll sometimes","\n We do instapolls in class to help us with examples and for credit for going to class. Gives us time to work on it.","Professor [Removed] designs 2 - 3 insta polls each class for the students to answer and practice the physics topics on their own. We are allowed to discuss with the students around us to find the best answer. She ultimately reviews the solution and explains any questions we may have.","We do insta polls every class to ensure our understanding.","We answer most of the group questions through instapolls, in practically every class.","Every class she has 1 - 2 [Removed] questions that we complete. We talk about them in small groups and share our thoughts on potential answers.","Every class we do an instapoll that's a part of our grade. It's a nice way to answer questions without having to worry about looking dumb if we are wrong.","We use instapoll everyday in class usually more than once per day","We have [Removed] questions in our class and discussion section every time we meet. These questions are graded on 80 % participation and 20 % accuracy to make sure that we at least try. We are encouraged to work with classmates to get the answer.","We do instapoll questions during class.","this happens every day. We do questions on different problems to get us to think critically about the scenarios, and how they would play out. we also discuss with the class and often write what we have learned so far to ( like a recall method ).","My instructor had us vote on certain topics and then discuss them afterward. This was used as an icebreaker to familiarise students with each other and to help the class become comfortable with sharing.","The instructor has asked an open ended question through kahoot but then given multiple choice answers for the class to answer as a poll and get results of the statistics of the class in that question. After seeking the chosen answers, he asks some people about why they chose a specific response and to elaborate on it.","The instructor does raise your hand prompts, where we get to raise our hands if we can relate to a specific topic of conversation.","This is shown by the daily instapolls in which we have to answer a given question. We discuss with each other and then share our answers.","During lecture at any point, our instructor would tell us that we had an instapoll question. It is always over the material that we are covering for that lecture."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

lecture, the professor would ask us to discuss with the people around us","In my [Removed] chemistry course, the instructor frequently had us discuss questions in pairs during class to promote engagement and understanding. For example, after introducing a new concept, the instructor would say, \" Turn to your partner and discuss how you would solve this problem together. \" This structure allowed us to collaborate and explore different perspectives, making the learning experience more interactive and dynamic.","Periodically during a lecture, the instructor will pose a question about the new material and ask us to discuss our answer with a neighbor.","The instructor told us to discuss something with a neighbor whenever there are active learning slides.","For example, the last Wednesday, before [Removed] showed the answer to a question, she asked for us to create the [Removed] structure ourselfves and idenifiy if it is non - polar or polar and if it's covalent bond.","When we were talking about periodic table trends, she asked us to turn and talk about why it is the way it is. This happened during lecture. After we talked, she went through some elements and wrote out their [Removed] to then explain the [Removed] trend, which correlates to the radius trend, which correlates to [Removed].","They put a problem on the board and asked us to solve it and she encourage talking with peers to figure out the answer.","When the professor wants to teach a new concept or has finished teaching, there will be active learning, allowing students to discuss the material to ensure a thorough understanding, after which the professor will provide the correct answer.","During class, we usually work on active learning modules with the person next to us. This allows us to collaborate and help us teach each other.","This happens every class","She said discuss with the people around you how to work through this problem during the middle of class.","Every few slides that she goes over, she'll tell us to turn to our neighbors and talk it out.","Throughout the lecture, [Removed] provides opportunities for students to discuss in class problems with each other and work through various problems together.","Last class ( so last Wednesday ) Dr. [Removed] had us discuss the reason why a group 1 element and a group 7 element would want to bond. She gave us time to discuss and then brought us back, saying that these ions would form not only because of their valence electrons but more so on the basis of their nonmetal and metal characteristics as well as their underlying differences in electronegativity values.","As we go through the lecture, we come across practice problems that apply whatever we have been talking about. The professor would then tell us to try to go through the problem by ourself or to solve it with a person sitting next to you. We would then have 1 or 2 minutes to work through the problem and to discuss it with the students sitting next to us in the lecture hall. This would happen a couple of times throughout the lecture, to either practice a question type or to summarize what we just learned","During our lectures, she would give us a question and ask us to discuss it with the peers around us. This happens once or twice every lecture.","She does this every class period when we discuss the topics of the lecture with out peers.","The instructor put up a problem on the slideshow for everyone to see during the lecture after introducing the topic, then allowed us 2 - 3 minutes to discuss with the people around us how to approach it and come up with an answer. She after showed us the correct answer and sped through the explanation.","Very class at least 2 - 3 times we have to either do a practice problem with the people around us or just talk about the information we just learned before moving on. Its normally a minute or so.","Our teacher regularly has us turn to our \" neighbor \" and figure out practice problems on the board together. This happens at least once per class.","Instructor will show a problem and then ask students to discuss with each other to find the answer, and then when the time is complete, she solves the problem for everyone as well.","These kind of things typically happen at the beginning of class. She will show us a problem, ask us to solve it, and then have us discuss it with the people around us to see if we have similar answers or if we have any questions.","She just tells us to discuss it with people around us. This happens probably one every class.","She does this every class day. We are always asked to share what we think about the material with our neighbors.","When reviewing our lectures we are usually asked to come together in small groups and talk about what we know or have learned. This usually happens every lecture.","We start off with warm ups. For example, we'd be given a molecule to create a lewis structure for and discuss with people around us.","We were going through the slides presented in class and on one of them it had a question. The professor than asked for us to discuss in a small group or pairs. This happened last week during class.","Dr. [Removed] has us attempt practice problems throughout lectures with those around us. She asks us to discuss certain topics amongst our peers too.","Whenever a new topic comes up or when we review the topis from the last week, the instructor always be like \" talk about this with people around you \".","Our instructor would tell us to consider and explain our thoughts on the \" why \" behind phenomena or work out the answer to question / s posed within slides to a partner or group. Sometimes, it's more for review, other times, it serves to lead thinking to further points within the lecture.","We often stop and talk to our neighbors about the lesson or work on explaining it to eachother","People started talking together and discussing the question. It worked pretty well.","In pairs, mainly because we only have access to our partners but it's effective for sure. Mainly because you know the answer or you don't and sometimes your partner will clarify or add on.","The professor asks her students to spend some time thinking about a concept she is teaching. She also provides problem sets on the board for us to solve together between our peers sitting next to us.","Whenever we are working on practice problems after Dr. [Removed] talks about a topic, we are encouraged to talk with others to get the idea to sink in.","Dr. [Removed] uses an active learning method where she implements various practice problems and questions to stimulate discussion amongst students. This helps others to further grasp the concepts as discussion helps retain the information and truly understand.","When we have practice problems during lectures, we are encouraged to discuss them with our peers to come up with answers.","My professor makes us discuss the topic learned in class with the peers around us. This happens every lecture. After teaching a topic, she tells us to speak among ourselves.","The instructor asked for thoughts of the class on a certain topic we just covered. She released an instapoll so people could answer.","She always gives us practice problems on the projector that we then talk about with the people sitting around us.","After covering a topic, she would give us a practice question and talk about it in pairs or in a group to practice the material and \" speak it out \". This happens pretty much every class.","[Removed] gave us a chemistry question and asked us to talk about it with the people next to us. She will then tell us the answers.","Asking to discuss certain topics with others to see if students understand","It can be difficult to split into small pairs in such a large lecture setting but there are often times where we are asked to work with the classmates sitting close to us to work through a problem before going over it as a class.","She puts problems up and asks [Removed] to work with our peers to solve them","N / A","She asks a question and tells us to talk amongst ourselves","The professor will have a question in the slideshow and ask people to work with the people sitting near them to figure it out.","This week, for example, Dr. [Removed] asks us to calculate the work done from a combustion reaction. Then, we would discuss with our neighbors of how to solve the problem and compare the answer each of us got.","If there was a practice problem or scenario she would tell us to turn to our peers and talk the problem through before explaining it herself to whole class.","She will ask a question and then ask us to discussion our thoughts or answers with the people around us before going over the question on the board.","She asks questions and we respond out loud","We were learning new material, and going over it, and Dr. [Removed] told us to turn to our neighbors and discuss. She wants us to discuss the new material so that we can gain a better understanding of it.","Our professor tells us every class when presenting practice problems to talk about what you think the answer is with someone next to you. We talk for about two minutes and then she goes through the correct answer.","When working on a question on the projector, she will ask people to talk as a small group about the question. This allows the students to compare their ideas because we all think in different ways.","We collaborate on [Removed] [Removed] theory, and work with our partner next to use to figure out the answer for hybridization of an organic molecule. This happens every class about 2 - 4 times a class and then the professor goes into detail what the correct answer is after discussion.","When there is a topic coming up in the lecture, the professor would allow us to discuss with our neighbors, and try to figure the answer.","Dr. [Removed], usually has a question up on the board and she askes us to discuss it with the people around us, which is usually 2 - 4 people. It really helps, because we get to help each other out.","There are problems we do each day, at least 1 to 2 that we do with the people around us. This way we can apply the concepts taught to us just after we hear them.","It happens multiple times a day. The professor will tell us to discuss the material or think a problem out during class.","Each lecture, the professor commonly tells us to turn to the person next to us so that we can discuss our logic and opinions on certain questions and topics. This has been extremely beneficial because it allows for me to better understand the materials and concepts.","open discussion with people next to you, almost every lecture, then the professor will go through the problem","The professor went over material in class from our learning module. Explained the concept and introduced an active learning slide in which the class was asked to solve a question. We were asked to discuss the problem with our peers and our thoughts.","Dr. [Removed] will often tell us to discuss an [Removed] question with someone sitting next us or talk through a topic we just covered with someone sitting next to us.","During lecture, the professor asked us to discuss and explain to the person next to us [Removed], [Removed] energy and radii trends worked and their exceptions. This was the lecture before the exam, so it was done to make sure we understood these new terms.","In lecture, Dr. [Removed] always has one or two questions or ideas she puts up on her slides for us to talk to the people around us about, or check your answer with.","When my instructor had us discuss a question with our neighbor, she would do this by working a similar problem with the class and then having us do a problem just like it. She would have us do this in order to see if we could apply what we just learned in our own question. After she would have us discuss with others, we would come together and work the problem as a group.","Throughout class, our instructor will allow us to talk to each other about a certain question or practice with each other to discuss our understanding.","We always get 3 min approximately to discuss [Removed] problems or theoretical content ( analysis based ) with peers around us.","THe instructor usually presents a question on the screen and then asks us to discuss with the people nearby and come up with an answer. This usually happens every class and is something relatively common.","We do this in every class where we work with our peers to answer in - class questions provided by the instructor. This allows us to work together and work with our peers to gain a greater understanding of the material. This also allows us a time to work with our TAs if both ourselves and our peers are confused about something.","Every time we meet for class, we discuss our warm - up as well as other parts of the notes with those sitting next to us. This occurs every time I am in class.","During every classes, professor let us have a small talk to discuss about the questions she brings up. She always say to talk about it with people near us.","This happens when we get to an example on the board and she has us talk it out with our peers before she tells us the answer.","The instructor often asks questions over the material we cover during class and asks us to turn to the person next to us and discuss or answer the question so we can learn the concepts through collaboration.","Our instructor will sometimes put questions on the board and have us talk our problems with classmates around us. This helps us understand the material better as we get to talk out any concerns with our peers.","Dr. [Removed] regularly had us discuss questions in small groups during lecture, especially when tackling challenging topics like equilibrium or reaction rates. This occurred midway through each lecture, where the instructor would present a complex problem and say, \" Turn to your neighbor and work through this together for a few minutes. \" After the discussions, we would share our answers as a class, and the instructor would clarify any misunderstandings. This collaborative approach helped us understand difficult concepts through peer explanation and group problem - solving.","We have questions on [Removed] [Removed] ex. Is this molecule polar or non polar \n It happens usually 1 - 2 times during class \n The professor usually talks about the problem before we answer it to help our comprehension \n","We discuss stuff with people sitting around us","We are asked to talk with our neighbors about a problem that was posted on the board during the lecture","Frequently in the course we are asked to discuss a question in small groups. The instructor encourages this type of activity as it has shown to produce greater understanding of challenging concepts.","She would put a problem up on the board during class ( most lectures this occurs ) and we would discus the problem with our surrounding classmates and work the problem out with each other and check our answers with each other.","After each slide with questions, we talk with each other to understand the question and answer it.","We would go over a topic, and then she would give us a practice problem about the topic. She would tell us to work together to solve the question and give us about 5 minutes before reviewing the answer with the whole class \n","Professor [Removed] always asks us to talk to a partner when given an example question. We are told to discuss our answers","In every class lecture Dr. [Removed] has us break up into small groups and workout or discuss a certain topic that maybe difficult to understand upon first introducing it. We also do this for practice problems to help engrain the fundamentals in our heads.","During the course, [Removed] often offers opportunities for the students to collaborate and learn from each other. Yesterday, in her class we were learning about bonds and she allowed us to talk and ask questions to those around us.","This has been helpful in lecture, when a problem is shown on the screen we have to work it out and discuss our work with those around us. It is really helpful for me to understand information, but also a good way to recall information as I can help others understand something if they don't","Every class she grants us multiple opportunities to answer questions and discuss our answers with the students around us. I find it to be a very refreshing part of the class, and it works wonders for understanding the material better.","In Dr. [Removed]'s class on Wednesday we were going through the lecture for the day, and got to some practice problems and was instructed to try and figure them out with the person sitting next to us to get us thinking about the problems and what our answers would be. After talking to the person next to me I was able to better understand the questions being asked after getting another persons point of view on the answers.","There are active learning sections during lectures. During these sections, we talk to the people around us to answer the question.","The professor would explain certain concepts from the material during the lecture and at random times she would ask us to discuss with our neighbor about our opinion on the concepts mentioned. They would also have us discuss with the person sitting next to us about the best way to approach a certain question.","Ask the class to discuss with our neighbors","There would be times when she would put an exam question on the board and then we would discuss them with our shoulder partners, and this happens about every class. Then a minute or two of talking through things with our partner, she would work through the problem.","Using [Removed], students are asked to participate when engaging in practice problems that often challenge what we have been learning. Dr. [Removed] gives us time to discuss and share with the people around us before going over the problem.","Professor [Removed] every class asked us to speak to our neighbors and the people around us at least 5 to 6 times per class. This helps to teach others how they   analyze problems and how they go about solving them.","Our class talks with one another on topics we are learning. We do this a lot, every class. Then Dr. [Removed] goes over the topic and answers.","Whenever there's an example problem or on the presentation, she lets us try it out for ourselves and discuss it with the people around us. This discussion is typically about how to answer it and/or the concepts surrounding it.","On course [Removed], we can post any questions we may have. She always encourages us to check that out and talk to others, help others, or ask questions ourselves.","Dr. [Removed] would give us 2 - 3 minutes to talk about a problem and work on it with the people around us. This happens quite frequently probably once or twice every class.","sometimes on the slides she has a question. she tells students to discuss with your seat neighbor","She allows students to discuss a question or problem in pairs or in small groups many times during class especially after teaching a topic.","Dr. [Removed] will provide a question or a set of questions and ask us to turn to someone sitting next to us to discuss the problem. This usually happens during lectures and helps us better understand what is being asked.","When we get to an \" active learning \" slide in the presentation, she tells us to discuss what we think with the people around us. For example, when we were learning about [Removed], we would try it on our own, discuss, and then she would bring us back as a full group to explain the correct reasoning.","We were discussing a new concept in chemistry. She asked us to discuss with our classmates around about how to solve a practice problem.","This is what I was elaborating on in my last answer. The instructor often allows us the opportunity to collaborate and learn from our classmates.","Last week, before the exam day Dr. [Removed] had practice problems on several subjects to prepare. She would have us attempt the problem with a partner or small group sitting around us before she would explain to the class.","Used [Removed], felt somewhat forced and disconnected.","Dr. [Removed] frequently asks students to turn next to each other and discuss a problem she may have on the board throughout lectures. She does this every lecture so almost every week.","Our instructor will give us a problem or a questions and ask us to turn to the student next to us and discuss our answer.","We work on problems in class very often with people sitting next to us, whether that's just on the slides during the presentation or on an instapoll. She has us talk to each other for 2 - 5 minutes and then explain our choice to the rest of class. She then explains the answer before moving on to the next one.","She allows discussion time for certain questions to discuss the answer with our partners / peers.","Every class we have the opportunity to discuss practice problems with the people around us. The professor prompts us to discuss and work with our peers after explaining or asking for the answer of a specific few questions.","She asks us all of the time to talk bout what we think the answer is to questions in class. It is useful because it allows us to bounce ideas off of each other in order to get the question right.","Whenever there is a question, sometimes we talk to our neighbors about the question, go through it, and try to answer it together.","When questions are posed to students in class, they are asked to talk with other students around them. This usually occurs when there are questions that are important or confusing.","In our current unit of thermodynamics, Dr. [Removed] wants us to know the fundaments of enthalpy and entropy and wants us to discuss our understanding with classmates. We can then share ways we remember the difference between each term.","When we are on an example question, she will ask us to talk to the people around us to get us to better understand the material. She does this every class multiple times.","Dr. [Removed] makes sure to give us time to solve questions and work up problems together and then goes over them herself.","Like I said before, every class between practice problems we get about 30 seconds to discuss the problems we are given with the people next to us before we get the answers. This allows us time to really try on the question.","At least one or two times a class, Dr. [Removed] tells us to turn to someone around us and work through the problem together.","There would be a problem in the slides following immediate coverage of the topics that that problem covers. This allows us to have a basic understanding fresh on our minds and apply that understanding accordingly. She does this frequently, at least twice per lecture. She explained the basics before and then wrote down answers while describing them, connecting them to the basic teachings. She provides plenty of time to answer.","each class we are given some practice problems to work out then discuss with someone next to us","We do v practice problems in class and are supposed to work it out and discuss it with the person next to us.","i m confused with what you're asking","She walked us through a problem and then let us complete another example of that type of problem by conferring with peers to determine the answer. Specifically, this happened when she asked us to make [Removed] structures in class for a resonance structure and find formal charges, and we did our work then checked with a peer before regrouping as a class.","When certain topics come up in our powerpoint lecture slides, she asks us to discuss what we know about it to the people we sit with. Usually it is not covered in lecture yet because it is something from our learning modules or something we already should've known.","We usually talk with our classmates about questions Professor [Removed] asks.   This happens throughout the class.","Every class, Dr. [Removed] introduces something called active learning where she asks us to discuss a topic with the person next to us. She also gives us around a minute every class to discuss the answer to a problem.","The instructor asked a question and then asked students to answer in small groups.","Yes, every day in class we turn to our peers on either side of us and answer the question provided.

Happens multiple times every class period. We also do it when answering [Removed].","Whenever there is an example problem or question during a lecture, the instructor urges us to work it out independently and explain it to a neighbor. This happens if not every lecture than every other, although the instructor has not done it in a couple of classes.

We would try to solve the practice questions. This would happen every class.","On Monday class, sometimes professor will let student talk what happen during the weekend and the stuff learned during last lecture","My professor's teaching style is typically showing an example problem on the board and having people work it out with those around them.","The instructor would have a question up on the slide and ask turn to our neighbors and talk about or work through the question.","Whenever Professor. [Removed] asked us to figure out something she tells us to speak to the people next to us and discuss it. Sometimes it's helped me better understand the thing we are learning in class","Before or after [Removed] [Removed] presents a topic, she will give us a few minutes to talk amongst the people arouns about the answer or what we think the answer is. Then she will go over it, sometimes the go over is breif while sometimes it is more in depth. It just depends but the answers will always be posted after class.","We often break to answer questions as pairs or in small groups. She encourages us to talk through the practice problems.","Last week, our instructor asked us to discuss a question she asked the whole class with the people next to us.","Every Wednesday 4 - 5 Dr. [Removed] holds office hours for her students to come by and ask any questions. These office hours are occurring every week without interruption. During these hours Dr. [Removed] allows for students to ask any questions about current or previous lectures and proceeds to give an overview with examples.","She would stop lecture every once in a while and say, “ Turn to the person next you and talk / explain / discuss this. ” She also would do this with most [Removed] polls.","During lecture, there are review questions on the slides that the instructor plans. When those review questions come up, the instructor tells us to talk to those near us and answer the question together, and talk about why we think our answer is our answer.","This happens all the time in class if there is a practice problem or a theory that can be worked out. This happens multiple class periods.","When going over questions, we discuss with our peers and build off each other's ideas. This happens every class, and she tells us to discuss it with those around us each class.","She presents slides every lecture and there are always multiple examples for which we must solve on our own or with classmates. Then we review the question as a class.","My instructor will include practice problems in the slideshow for us to answer during class, and she always recommends turning and talking to our neighbors about our answers!","We are shown practice problems throughout every lecture, and are told to work on them amongst ourselves. She then goes over the problems and how to solve them after a minute or so.","She has us do this every class so we think critcally. She always makes sure we engage with our classmates in some way.","My professor this week asked us to discuss understanding the energetic processes of melting water at room temperature. She first posed the question and then asked for our opinion and to make sense of it with the person next to us. This led to me discussing the question with my partner and supporting one another with our explanations.","She has us discuss what we got in certain questions and how we got them.","we have discussed questions presented by the teacher in small groups multiple times during each class","During lectures, our professor has active learning slides which include a question on the topics we are learning.

She helps us come up with questions, and allows us to understand it based on the material we learned in class.","We compared our soil isolates last week with group members. Our final project is a poster, so we discussed preparation for this.","As our lab is designed in small groups we tend to share things with our partners even when not needed. It is comforting to be a part of a group throughout the labs feeling more [Removed] through the understandings of our work and ideas.","In one of the earlier section when evaluating credible posters, our groups were told to discuss how it met the guidelines. We compared our thoughts with one another and shared with the class.

Some times we will even talk to students next to us.","This happens pretty frequently as we will go through the pre lab objectives and main ideas in class and discuss it with our groups. She will ask a general question, asks us to talk among our group about it then share with the class","We work in lab table's so every day you are working with a small group. Y'all will figure out the lab and your soil together.","[Removed] usually will explain certain points of the pre - lab with us, and turn some questions to us to make sure we fully understand what we are doing and why.","When discussing questions such as : \" How can a bacteria colony be genetically resistant to antibiotics? \" from the [Removed] instructions before getting started on the lab.","She'll ask a question and then as a group we try to give a response. This is pretty common occurrence that offers the group to collaborate and give differing perspectives.","During the first [Removed] experiment, my table did not get ideal results. [Removed] encouraged us to talk about what could have gone wrong and how we could correct the experiment the next time, and we got results that made more sense the next time.","[Removed] has us work with our groups","It was during the presentation she would do before lab. I don't remember the exact question, but she always encourages us to share our thoughts.","Yes, our set up allows us to collaborate in a small group all the time, we ask questions.","When we are in our lab groups we all talk and sometimes we will talk about things that maybe the instructor or TA should fix that would be beneficial for us students. What happened was we grew a relationship with the TAs and we were able to confide in them and tell them our problems. They will tell the instructor and due to our professor being very considerate will accommodate for us.","The instructor gave us posters to describe and explain the pros and cons.","We always work in groups or partners in order to effectively perform the lab experiment.","She helped us gain a better understanding of the procedure by talking with our partner.

She will also often present us with problems and have us investigate in our groups before giving us the correct answer.","I am unsure when exactly this was, but defiantly during the time when we were reviewing what sources are reliable to use. The instructor asked for input from the students and wanted them to answer aloud, in front of the whole class, what their answer was. In this specific day as well, she asked for input from every table to hold up what poster project was their favorite.","She would present us with a task during class and we would be asked to work together in groups to complete it. We would then discuss as an entire class our results","Since we also have to do perusall discussion we are constantly talking to people who have different ideas than us. Because of this we are exposed to new ideas and its interesting learning more about how someone can think differently about something.","We typically work with our tables which can foster the sense of appropriate discussion.","We are randomly put into table groups for the semester and work with these peers every week with the same soil sample.","During our labs she would encourage us to discuss certain observations of our experiment with our table and to review the differences between our results. She also allowed us to discuss questions with our group before she picked on a table to share their thoughts.","Each week we have a canvas assignment, in which one must read and comment on other students' reflections on a video or reading.","We worked together in groups to answer questions like what type of article we were reading or what kind of morphologies we were seeing. This happens basically every class.","When we were learning about types of sources to draw information from. The instructor had given us types of papers and wanted us to discuss about them and figure out which sources were actually credible.","I feel that we actively problem solve in our small groups everyday in lab, as we talk with our small groups on how to navigate the lab. [Removed], we also have done activities as a small group in which we rated different posters as a small group and told the class our rankings.","We work in small groups for our labs so we have consistent ongoing conversations about the results each duo in the group has and reflect on similarities and differences.","I want to say it was when we were looking at journal articles that she had us looking at them and talking in our small groups, but I don't remember off the top of my head what day that was.","We would have to look at samples of bacteria and discuss what we thought the characteristics were.","This is a lab, so we are always working in a small group of four students to discuss questions and problems.","What happened : We were going over the procedure for the experiments we were going to be performing that day in lab via a powerpoint. \n When this happened : During lab \n Words the instructor said : She asked us to discuss terminology that applied to the experiment.","We discuss current world problems and their possible solutions on the perusall discussion [Removed]","Well we worked in lab groups so she always encouraged us to work with them and learn from eachother","This time it was something like, my bacteria was pink under the gram stain, is that why it was resistant to antibiotics? and we all had to discuss and share ideas.","The class is separated into teams of four or less people. Because of the class structure we have to discuss questions and problems together as a team.","We work with our lab groups in every class, so there is a lot of discussion about how to carry out certain tests or answering questions if one of us are confused. I ask questions in every lab.","The instructor told us to discuss an answer within our pod, choosing pods to answer the questions later on as a class","We were asked to discuss in our group why our electrophoresis for our positive control did not show. This happened 10/24/2024. \" We had an error in the preparation of [Removed] solution \"","When trying to map out [Removed] - linked traits, our instructor provided us with materials to understand where nondisjunction occurs. These materials were used as a group and we used each other's knowledge to try and understand where nondisjunction could appear in a certain scenario.","Every class, Dr. [Removed] gives on questions / problems to work throughout the lectures in order to see if we are able to understand what is being taught and she encourages us to work in our table groups to figure them out. Allowing us to discuss the questions in table groups allows us to check with each other and see if we have actually grasped the concept.","This happens usually together with [Removed] questions, where before answering you can consult with your table group on the question you have to answer. She will usually just say instapoll is open and answer the question.","We discuss our answers to instapoll questions","For quizzes and in class instapolls, we are encouraged to work as teams to learn from eachother. It is very helpful to get help from peers, while also contributing in class when we are asked questions or to discuss the instapoll questions.","She would have a question up on a slide or have us do instapoll. She would tell us to discuss answers with our groups.","I often discuss [Removed] problems with the people at my table. Also, every now and then Dr. [Removed] gives us in - class activities to explicitly work on as a group. Additionally, we are encouraged to work together outside of class as well.","During lecture, if there is a question or instapoll, sometimes Dr. [Removed] would have us discuss the answers with our table groups 1st before going over it as a class, Our table has about 5 - 6 people, and after giving us 3 - 4 minutes to discuss, she would ask some tables to share outloud, or she would go over the question herself.","Our class is laid out in table groups so she often gives thought - provoking questions or activities for us to do with our table mates","Dr. [Removed] frequently tells us to speak with others at our tables or to form groups at our tables to discuss ideas. Sometimes this is for questions and sometimes she will have us work hands - on with a diagram.","Dr. [Removed] has us do [Removed] instapolls to actively learn in class and allows us to collaborate with our peers.","Typically, before an instapoll, students are sent to discuss the questions in their table groups before sharing with the class or submitting the poll. Table groups are given fun names to emphasize community and collaboration.","The instructor asks us to discuss in our small groups during every class in order to get us to communicate verbally.","Every class we discuss instapoll questions with our group. This has happened every class throughout the course. She tells us to turn to our partners and discuss.","Everyday we do instapoll questions and discuss with our group what the right answer might be.","The instructor encourages students to discuss every [Removed] with classmates. The most recent occurrence of this was during the most recent lecture.","There are multiple times during class where the instructor allows for collaboration between students. Collaboration is not only welcomed but heavily encouraged by the instructor.","In our discussion sections, she gives us time to discuss our answers before going over it as a class.","Dr. [Removed] does exactly this every class as she will often let us work in groups to work on the instapolls during class. She also will call on people, or allow people to raise their hands and answer their questions.","Before any instapolls, she always allows us to talk with our designated groups to talk about the solution we think is right.","The unstructured has assigned rows of seats for people in groups to comfortably collaborate with. She encourages collaboration in these groups for answering polling questions, and will call upon these groups for in class problem solving.","In my genetics course, every class, the instructor asks us to discuss a genetic mutation problem in small groups for about 10 minutes before sharing our solutions with the class. Before the activity, the instructor said, \" Working in groups will help you think through the problem from different angles and test your understanding by explaining it to others. \" Afterward, the instructor facilitated a class - wide discussion, encouraging us to compare approaches and clarify any misconceptions. This collaborative exercise allowed us to engage more deeply with the material and strengthened our problem - solving skills.","We sit in groups and she calls on a group to answer an instapoll question","We are split into teams and we even got to name our teams which is super fun, we are called \" New [Removed]. \" We discuss our ideas when Dr. [Removed] presents us a question and its nice to talk to people and have them help me as well.","Our instructor puts us in teams and every class we work on instapolls together.","Dr. [Removed] assigned the class into teams of about 6 students so that we could get to know people in our class and build a stronger community within the class. Throughout the lectures, she askes us to discuss with our teams on questions for the instapolls.","For polls during class Dr. [Removed] encourages us to work together.","In class after learning a certain skill, Dr. [Removed] introduces us to a [Removed] question in which we have time to talk with our peers and confer about which answer is correct. This makes the class feel more as a discussion rather than being alone and having more possibility to fail.","We sit in groups during class time and when we do install questions we work together. Also, we are allowed to collaborate on certain things in the course","We do this in discussion section of my genetics class.","During lecture time, we are grouped into teams where we can choose a name and with with during class. Additionally, we are given time to discuss answers with our peers during discussion sections. This allows us the chance to learn from out mistakes by talking it out with friends before the professor says the answer.","Every lecture she has instapolls and always us to communicate with our classmates to solve the problems.","Every class we split into our groups to answer the given instapoll questions before going over them as a whole class.","Throughout the presentation slides during class, Dr. [Removed] has allowed her students to collaborate in a space that allows us to make mistakes. After collaborating, we are able to electronically input our answers online through [Removed].","Every time we reach a section during her lecture, she would have [Removed] questions over materials she had just went over in class. Then, students would be given an opportunity to talk about the questions and responses with their group members.","We discuss [Removed] answers in small groups every day during class.","Dr. [Removed] has instapolls inside class that gives us a chance to use the knowledge we just learned and try to answer questions with our peers. This involves many of the group mates in our pods from discussion sections.","During [Removed] questions in class, we have the opportunity to talk through our thought process before she goes over the answer. We are able to talk to each other about we think the answer is.","We sit in teams where we can talk about different types of answers to questions our instructor asks us, such as [Removed].","In class, we are split up into random teams and Dr. [Removed] usually asks us to discuss with our teammates about the instapoll questions that she launches. Usually we are asked to think about it ourselves and then we share our thoughts with our fellow team members.","For every problem / [Removed] we discuss with the person sitting next to us in class. This happens 2 - 3 times per class day","We do this almost every class or every two classes. He'll ask the students to discuss with their partner next to them or ask the partner if they have any questions about the lecture. When we do Instapolls, he has us discuss with people as well.","The instructor asks us every single class to consult with out neighbors about what we think the answer to the [Removed] question is. Also, just general questions that get asked, the professor asks us to tell our neighbor what we think.","Dr. [Removed] would give instapoll practice questions to us. He would prompt us to discuss them with those around us in order to find the correct answer. This would happen every day in lecture.","Every time we have lecture our instructor will put up an instapoll and have us work with the people next to us and the teaching team to solve the questions. We do this 1 - 2 times per lecture.","Instapoll questions","During class, there are numerous instapolls that we are told and asked to work on with our neighbors. This allows for you to ask questions and get help from others or provide them with help. I really enjoyed this aspect of the class.","We solve instapoll questions with a peer.","Usually when we do Instapolls or practice problems in class we discuss with people near us and find the answer together or discuss answer together before he goes over the answer with the whole class. During that time he is also walking around the room answering anyone's questions.","every time he is working though a problem he will tell us to check in with our neighbor before proceeding.","Everytime we do an instapoll question we are supposed to chat with our neighbors to figure out the answer. The instructor will physically tell us to work with our neighbors.","Every class, we will complete instapoll quizzes and will work with the people around us to answer a question. There are lots of opportunities to work with others in this class.","He let us work in groups during our exam retake for midterm 2 which really helped me out.","Dr. [Removed] has students answer instapolls each class period. He has students work with one another to find an answer, and pushes students to chat with their neighbor if they are initially reluctant.","During class when there is a problem, he encourages the students to talk to one another. We help each other out and work together.","[Removed]. We are always told to work in groups or with classmates near us. Every class almost always has [Removed].","During lecture we have instapoll questions. Most of these questions are designed to get students to interact with each other.","\" Work with your neighbor \"","This usually occurs when the instapoll is up, in every lecture. Every time there is an instapoll, he encourages us to talk to our neighbors and work out the problem together. He'll also tell us to talk to neighboring students to theorize what will happen during a live demo.","We do this every day in class.   He will ask us a question and have us try to answer it with our neighbors and then we discuss as a class.   This also applies when we are solving problems ; he asks us to solve the problem first with our peers then goes over the answer in class.","The instructor asked us to discuss problems with our neighbors and also to collaborate with them.","Every class we do instapoll questions. He has us discuss with the people sitting around us each time.","We did a retake after midterm two during the week. It was a chance to merit credit lost on the exam. Instead of a \" curve, \" which does not help students grow and learn.","In every class we have practice questions where we are encouraged to work with a partner and Mr. [Removed] also usually asks a question and then says to discuss with a classmate. This is a usual and regular occurrence.","[Removed] talking about question during every class \n","In lecture, we solve problems on instapolls and collaborate with those around us to find an answer. We then come together as a class to solve the problem and check if we were right or why and where we may have gone wrong.","In class, Dr. [Removed] will often encourage us to think about the ways to solve the practice problems with our neighbor and will give us adequate time to do so. This happens almost everyday when we do our instapolls and he will tell us to talk to the person next to us.","He does this every week when we do each problem. It'll be this awkward silence and he'll say \" Don't forget to talk to your neighbor \" or \" Introduce yourselves to each other \".","Dr. [Removed] has us work in pairs or small groups whenever we do an instapoll or practice physics problem. He has us talk it out before we submit an answer","Dr. [Removed] would tell us to discuss instapoll questions with those around us during the times of class we did practice questions. He would specifically tell us to talk to our neighbors and converse about the questions.","Often our professor instructs us to talk through instapoll questions with our peers to help direct us in answering the question. It occurs almost every lecture which is nice because it is a very interactive class and talking the question out aids in the thought process. The professor will put up a question and then give us some time to answer while discussing with our peers. Afterwords, the professor will ask what some students got and then go over the question for us.","Dr. [Removed] always tells us to talk to the people around us and partner with someone to solve the instapoll questions together.","During every instapoll, we work with the people around us to do the problem and to learn how to approach it","This is a daily occurrence. We pair up and do instapolls and ask each other questions when we are confused or brainstorming solutions.","Every class, we solve instapolls through discussing with our neighbor","After every topic the professor would tell the class to discuss what was explained with a neighbor.","The instructor encourages us to talk to our classmates frequently to be able to collaborate with them during problem solving. \n","The instructor does this often when teaching concepts in the class by asking us students to talk to our neighbors about what we think about the concepts or how we would go about the problem solving process to solve the questions he poses. He does this nearly every class period.","WHenever we do a practice problem, or if he explains something, he tells us to turn to our neighbor the work out the problem or check in with each other to see if we understand it.","Every class, the instructor encourages students to talk amongst themselves to solve problems.

So every instapoll, we would discuss the person near us.","we have required instapolls during every class where we are graded on accuracy. we are given a question then we get like 5 mins to discuss with our neighbors and figure out how to solve the question","In our course, the instructor often prompted us to engage in small - group discussions by presenting a thought - provoking question or complex problem. We then discussed in pairs, analyzing different perspectives before reconvening as a class to share insights. This format encouraged collaborative problem - solving and allowed us to explore varied approaches, enhancing our critical thinking skills in real - world scenarios.","During every lecture, the instructor tells students to discuss a questions with others around them. He does this multiple times per lecture.","During each class, the instructor will give us an example problem in which he tells us to work with the people around us to answer it. If he sees students not engaging with their peers he will again remind us to work with the people around us.","Based on practice question at the end of class, we are encouraged to collaborate in answering these. Working with others makes the questions at the end of class easier.","We can discuss when doing square cap questions every class. He tells us to discuss beforehand.","Yes, there has been study groups and such during discussions.","In the weekly discussion sections, students discuss questions in small groups. Additionally, when doing the squarecap, Dr. [Removed] encourages us to work on the problems in pairs / groups.","This is really did not happen in the course in my opinion so I can not speak to what the instructor has done.","We complete a [Removed] ( quiz ) at the end of every class and we are able to work with our peers beside us, as well as the TAs in order to discuss and understand the questions given to us.","He asked us to discuss / explain a concept to each other during the square cap sessions and encouraged us to work together at the end of class.","After the lesson is complete, the professor asks us to discuss the [Removed] questions with our peers, ask the TAs for help, and complete all of the questions. This happens for the last 20 minutes every class period, and then he goes over the answers and explains each question afterwards.","Everyday after we finish the lecture notes we move onto the square cap questions where we work with those around us to answer the questions. These questions can be multiple choice, free response, and select all that apply so it gives a variety for you and your peers to discuss about.","We use a website, [Removed], to do active question sessions every class of about 10 questions to cover the material learned in the lecture. It's graded so it encourages attendance to lecture but it also helps a lot to review what we learned in class that day","In the course, we do square cap questions around the last 10 - 20 minutes at the end of class. This allows students come together and discuss which answer is most appropriate for the question.","During the square cap sessions every class we are supposed to work with the people around us to answer the questions.","After every lecture, we complete questions on [Removed] and he allows us to discuss the questions with our classmates.

Afterwards he would ask the class collectively about their thoughts.","The professor will project a question on the screens that the whole class will have to discuss and solve in small groups. The happens every class. The professor asks a variety of questions all about the material we covering in that class. \n","Every day in class, he has us do squarecap questions with our peers.","There's usually some sort of icebreaker where we talk in small groups.","Dr. [Removed] does this with insta polls. He requires to answer question for attendance and for understanding material. He allows and encourages us to use our resources they being our neighbors with who we sit with.","We had an activity and we had to discuss some questions that she put up on the board.","In this course, we have weekly icebreakers as well as questions related to the content. As a group and with the people around us, we are able to interact and share our thoughts with one another.","My instructor has always prioritized making the class feel like a community. She has done this by getting us to engage in conversations together. We will often have an icebreaker during each class and we will share with a neighbor and then whole class.","The instructor asked questions about possible career paths and campus resources. We were told to talk about it with someone nearby. Then asked to shared with the class","When we do our instapolls we sometimes get the opportunity to work alongside our classmates. We share our ideas and later share our findings.","Every day at the end of class, the instructor will put some questions up on the board and ask us to talk with the people around us to come up with answers and explanations to those questions. We are normally in groups of around 4, but it just depends where you are sitting.","The instructor posed a question to the entire class, and informed us to talk amongst those close to us to reach a consensus on what the answer to the question is. This happens almost every class, with only a few class sessions not having this due to a lack of time.","During lecture, often at the beginning or end, the instructor polls the class over various problems covered in or around that lecture. He instructs us to work with those around us to come up with an answer.","As I have stated in the past, the professor has made the class discuss amongst themselves on problems presented in class and set up the discussion sections in a similar method.","Sometimes, the instructor will tell us to talk to the people around us when discussing a topic that we do not completely understand. It helps everyone get on the same page and helps bring some to a better understanding of the material.","During lecture she'll tell us to turn to someone near us and discuss how we would begin solving a problem she has up on the board","In discussion sessions we do this.","Every class she'll ask questions and say to discuss with a partner before discussing on a volunteer basis with the rest of the class","She said “ turn to your neighbor and discuss this question before we do it together. ”","during instapoll questions we are asked to talk to our neighbors","Every class, there's instapoll questions asked, and we're encouraged to participate in groups with our classmates.","Our instructor makes sure to ask a handful of students their opinion when asking a question to the class.","We were discussing our favorite movies. This happened a couple of weeks ago. The instructor said to turn to someone near you and try to guess your favorite movie based on a few words.","During one of our icebreaker activities, we had to pair up, share, and discuss different topics with our partners. This activity helped break down initial barriers, making it easier to connect with classmates. \n","Every time we have class, she has some ice breaker for all of us to do in the beginning with a small group or the people we are sitting with. It is a good way to get to know new students and make new friends.","During dry labs, the instructor encouraged students to discuss amongst us what was confusing and ask any questions for further clarification. We were often in small groups."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

It allows us to improve and solidify our knowledge.","She provides us with an example question to discuss about with the people sitting near us and then after some time we come back together and she explains the question. She also provides questions on instapoll for us to answer.","Our professor often has us share ideas with one another and the whole class in lectures. This is nice because it gives us an opportunity to learn better and utilize one another as a resource for excelling in this course.","Since the class is about 400 people, the professor does not ask questions that should be answered in front of the whole class.","Not the whole class but we discuss as a group sometimes.","In the class lessons","During the lecture, Dr. [Removed] likes for us to turn to a neighbor to explain what we just learned. It's usually to discuss and clear up and questions we might have that our neighbors could answer, and sometimes it to work on a practice question together.","The instructor asked the students a question that she wanted the students to think about and answer. This happened at least once a week during the lectures when she wanted to review the information taught.","Dr. [Removed] doesn't personally ask a few students to answer questions. She asks general questions to the whole class in which a few students choose to respond to and she acknowledges. Since the class is roughly 500 individuals, she acknowledges who ever is closest or the loudest. Through acknowledging, she repeats what they said and waits to hear an opposing opinion, if not, she solves the problem.","Sometimes when lecturing the instructor will ask a question to test our understanding of the concept. The instructor lets the whole class say the answer. This way, there is no spotlight on one person which would deter some people from participating.","She usually has students volunteer during the end of class when she does her experiments. She also has students answer the practice questions sometimes if we have time.","During class, we get the opportunity to share their though processes and how they got up to that point. It's good to see how my classmates are doing and their progress in the course.","In the class Dr. [Removed] asks us questions where we have to respond. She does this frequently, including this past week. The instructor typically asks us questions to clarify the information and   to stimulate our brains, I can't remember word for word what she said.","She asks a question and looks around the lecture hall to see if anyone would like to answer. The entirety of the lecture hall usually answers in [Removed].","We have turn and talks and then she asks us to share I think","Every lecture she will ask questions to the whole class and expect us to answer in unison while she's teaching.","The lecture hall is very large but the teacher provides time to provide input, with tas in sections and others.","Some students ask questions","She asked the class if anyone had come up with an idea to memorize and understand the material better.","If there is a question Dr. [Removed] would like for us to answer, she will call on a student who raises their hands. Or, if a student has a question she will make sure to answer before moving on to the next topic.","she asks every lecture to discuss with the people next do you","We often do example problems during class lectures. Sometimes she will ask the class a question and wait for people to respond and she will write the answer up on the board.","Have had few students answer general questions or help with a demonstration","I agree. This has been done.","Asking questions to the class, then explaining how to get to the answer","She does not ask students to verbally share their opinions with the class. However, she always asks us to share opinions with peers sitting together.","I don't think this happened, the class is very large so it is okay","Professor asked basic / simple question on the topic being learned for the class to respond. Class can respond or certain students but no pressure. The instructor then goes over the question and answer. This happens on a regular basis.","We were going over the first day of unit 2 day 1. Professor [Removed] asked us how our weekend was going and then started lecturing. She then asked us about an electronegativity problem and asked us to come up with a solution. We were supposed to discuss amongst each other and then when we were done, she went over the problem in class.","She often asks to discuss questions ( practice problems ) on the slides with our friends. She also asks us to share our ideas with her.","When Professor [Removed] lectures she always asks the class to answer questions or elaborate and what she is teaching, which is very refreshing and helpful. She always makes sure to keep us engaged and makes sure we are understanding her.","Does not happen often, Usually people just shout out the answer. No need for someone to call","In this class, Professor [Removed] would tell us to air the answers out to particular questions, but sometimes she would get frustrated at students whispering while we're trying to understand the material.","She just asked for students thoughts on why a concept had the trend shown or would just ask for answers to the questions. She normally just says does anyone have any idea why or something like that.","Dr. [Removed] has done this maybe 1 time. I don't really see her do it that often, which I feel like she should.","The professor has, multiple times, asked for student answers during our lecture. If the student is right she praises them and continues with the lesson. If the student is wrong, she will correct them cordially, then continue.","She asked a question over what the answer was after we had small group discussions.","She actually called on people to answer questions out loud this week for the first time","I was thinking about during the lecture part of the course because usually we answer the questions our peers have when we talk in small group. I don't think it has happened with the whole class yet.","After we talk about an example in class ( with the people around us ), she will ask if anyone would like to share their reponse with the class","They asked everyone what they thought of a particular electronic geometry. Only one person answered. She then corrected them.","n / a","The professor was going over something from the slide deck and asked the students in the room what they thought the answer to the questions were. She proceeded to ask about 2 or 3 students for answers to different questions.","I think the professor has only once or twice called on a student to answer a practice problem we were working on during class.","This doesn't happen often at all but it's happened this past week and I remember it clearly. She didn't call on specific students but some students are willing to talk.","Sometimes when solving examples questions some students raise their hands and tell the answer. \n","My professor will not do this often but she allows us the opportunity to speak with our classmates about class material","Our professor often asks questions during lecture allowing for students to engage with content","In our chemistry class, the instructor often paused during problem - solving sessions to ask students to verbally share their answers or reasoning with the whole class. This typically happened after completing a practice question, with the instructor saying, “ Can someone walk us through their approach? ” These discussions helped clarify misunderstandings and fostered a collaborative learning environment.","During every lecture, Dr. [Removed] asks her class to respond to her questions which helps engage her students. This typically happens during our reinforcement problems.","I'm not to sure as sometimes we don't have enough time for students to share their answers to the class.","It didn't really happen","When walking through a topic, our professor likes to see what we would \" expect \" it to be before revealing the answer.","It isn't often that this happens because the lecture hall is big and hard for people to participate.   It happens only sometimes.","She usually looks for some sort of mass participation / understanding and people will call out answers","The professor asked students for their opinion in instapolls on the right answer. This happened on Mondays when there are instapolls.","She sometimes will ask questions for the whole class. No one responds so she ends up answering them herself or instead having us talk to a neighbor about the question instead.","While the professor does not call on specific students to share, she has everyone answer the questions out loud together multiple times a class. She listens to ensure that people are all consistent with their answers, then provides the answer herself.","We have times where we can talk to each other about the problems","The instructor asks students to answer questions and share their ideas on the topics during lecture. This happens at least once per lecture.","She always asks for answers in lectures, sometimes student respond sometimes they don't. if they do, she goes off and either says that they are correct or if they can improve.","when people have questions, sometimes she shares their questions aloud to the class","I don't remember the professor asking this since there are more than 200 students in the lecture.","Our professor would be lecturing on the slides in which she has questions built in. Then she asks us to turn to people around us to discuss the question, then she asks the class what the answer is.","She would display practice problems / questions in lectures and discuss them with those around us. After we were done discussing, she asked for a person to answer.","At least once or twice during every class, she brings up topics, such as a thermodynamics slide of photos that correlate with either orderly or chaotic and instructs us to discuss with those around us which group they belong to and how this relates to entropy. On other occasions, she will ask questions and call on volunteers to share their ideas/ answers with the entire class.","The instructor would ask the whole class chemistry related questions and the whole class would collaboratively answer. The instructor would never single someone out.","They asked a student to answer a question. This happens most classes.","Professor [Removed] did this when she would ask a question and one person or multiple would answer out - loud. she wouldn't directly call on a person she would just wait for an answer by multiple students","The instructor would ask a question and wait for a student to answer out loud. They wouldn't specifically call on students but would wait for someone to raise their hand to answer or for a student to say the answer out loud.","The instructor ask questions directed at the class. Students then answer the questions via instapoll","Dr. [Removed] always asks open ended questions to the class about the example questions on the lecture slides. The students who are following along can say their answer out loud. It is a large auditorium, so there are always multiple students saying their answers out loud.","Dr. [Removed] always asks us first if anyone knows what a concept is in class or \" why does this happen? \" to allow students to respond.","Every single class, professor [Removed] does something called \" active learning \" in which you share your ideas with those around you in the class and collaborate to answer questions. She said it's meant to give you a chance to discuss the content with peers and help each other.","I think when we doing insta polls in class she ask us to share what we think is the right answer. So, usually some students speak and share with the whole class and she tells him if it's wrong or right.","After we finish our practice problems, the instructor would have us shout out the answer. She would go through the practice problem afterwards.","I don't think my instructor has had anybody share with the entire class during lectures.","The professor would ask a question about the current topic we were on and a student would raise their hand and attempt to answer the question. It was completely optional and if you don't want to participate, you don't have to raise your hand. The professor would just ask if anyone had an answer and if so to feel free to share.","Sometimes when we are discussing a particularly difficult subject, Dr. [Removed] will ask the class if they have any suggestions for memorizing / learning how to do it. Also, she will openly ask questions for the students to respond to all together.","Sometimes, Dr. [Removed] asks questions and calls on people to respond to them in front of the whole class. Usually, we turn to our neighbor and talk about answers then, but Dr. [Removed] occasionally calls on specific people.","Dr. [Removed] will show example for thermodynamics equations and ask the class to answer out loud about whether certain signs in equations should be positive or negative based on the reaction. Sometimes she will ask for us to explain why the signs are what they are.","She just had a few moments where she asks the class a question and just waits for students to raise their hands","This has never happened.","The professor occasionally asks people what they think of some topics. When we were discussing intermolecular forces, I remember a time when she asked the room what they thought about it. It was all voluntary and just picked people who raised hands.","We were going over new material and working on some practice problems. We were given a minute or two to solve them and the instructor said to communicate with other students near you on what the answer could be or ask for help.","She encourages some of us to blurt out answers for questions or ideas. This could be talking to each other as well.","Our professor will ask general questions when lecturing and ask for us to answer.","Asks students to help answer class examples","Dr. [Removed] always wants us to share the answers in lectures. She corrects us if we're wrong, but she explains thoroughly why the answer is correct. This happened I believe this week on Monday.","She will answer questions that are asked in class. We also have good TAs that answer questions throughout the class","It wasn't with the whole class but we did share ideas between tables, sometimes to help each other out with confusing parts of the lab or to help each other in analyzing our observations and data. It helped us improve our collective ability to effectively collect data and summarize what we did in the lab for the day.","Someone raised their hand, shared, and instructor provided their thoughts.","We were looking at sample posters to grade them in hopes of letting us know what we should and should not be doing on our research posters. This was at the beginning of the course, before we started with the actual experimentation. The instructor asked us to look the posters over in small groups and then share what we thought about each section as applicable.","We looked at other research posters and discussed the good and bad qualities as a class and voted on the best ones.","Not sure about the exact wording, but she encouraged students to call out answers to lab questions.","After we finished creating all of our different plates she called on a student to answer what the reason was for us to create all these different plates, and people raised their hands to answer and shared.","When discussing methods of the lab students share what the process is to confirm they are confident in their abilities to complete the lab.","Each table had a sample poster to grade. A person from each table explained their thoughts on the rubric.","We have some group work assignments. The instructor also has us answer conceptual questions behind the experimenta performed in lab.","We work in our small groups every day and when we look at slides as a class, she often has each table share a certain aspect of the information with the class.","N / A","Sometimes our TA will ask the class a question and allow other students to respond to their ideas","She asks a question to the whole class and people raise their hands to answer \n","There are sometimes where will ill talk about something and report back as a class, however these occasions are few and far between. Mostly [Removed] will just talk to us and then we will begin the work and ask them to come over if we have specific questions.","He asks the class to come up with questions so that he can answer them.","We have done this almost weekly when there is extra time after we have finished our lab work for the day. I appreciate this, especially since [Removed] is experienced and knows the course schedule. [Removed] will often prompt us to think about upcoming major assignments or milestones in the class and answer questions we have. I think this really helps us understand the techniques in class and be prepared for assignments.","In lab, my instructor will ask questions relative to what we are about to do laboratory wise. Or whenever we are completely a lab and actively doing something she will ask this is what you are doing, what does it mean and what will happen, or why are we doing this for everyone to answer / hear.","We were supposed to discuss if a source was credible in the second week of lab.

We discussed with partners and then were asked, only if we wanted to, to share with the class.","Pretty much every week we are asked to answer a question out loud to the rest of the class about how we feel or what we think about a question.","He makes [Removed] and has one person answer aloud.","Our professor asks us to share what we think the answer to the insta poll would be and this happens during every lecture. He usually asks the entire class if anyone would like to take a shot at answering this question or something along those lines.","When giving the answers to instapolls, Dr. [Removed] asks the class if they would like to answer the question based on their thoughts.","When answering instapoll questions, the professor will ask for a student to share the correct answer and how they got to it. This shows the class the thought process of the student,","After [Removed], he asks for a student to explain how they determined the correct answer.","During class there are instapoll that are done to check for understanding. Students are encouraged to share their answers during this time.","Dr. [Removed] asks the students in the lecture how we may start a problem, and it is up to us to answer. We are able to push our knowledge in a low - risk environment while helping other students.","When we do problems in class the instructor would always encourage students to share their answers and not be scared. She would encourage the quiet students to engage and make it a safe place for them to share ideas.","The instructor encourages us to answer along with her example problems and allows for questions to arise in the example's deconstruction. As a smaller class, sometimes it can be difficult to be vocal but the instructor is very open to allowing even the simpler questions to lead the discussion, which in turn results in more questions being asked.","After all problems done in class it is always encouraged for students whether working individually or with others around them to share their ideas and work off of each other to provide answers for the class to follow.","She always encourages us to speak up or asks us questions and why we may have thought aboit a specific answer. i think we had a poll the last week where we had two options and she had us explain our thinking.","It happens every week. We are given a question via instapoll and are asked to share our answers and reasoning in groups or to the class.","We work through questions in class and some students are asked to give their answers out loud.","Several times a class, the professor will pose a question, often in a poll everyone must submit an answer to online, and then ask students to share their answer and their reasoning. She will often ask multiple students in order to get multiple viewpoints, and sometimes the poll remains open, so you can change your answer based on other students' arguments.","During every class, Professor [Removed] engages with us and gives us the opportunity to answer questions after giving us a bit of time to solve them. This interaction is definitely a significant part of this class.","Professor [Removed]'s method of teaching includes her students learning most of the foundational material outside of class, before a lecture, and then she spends the in - class time going over the application of this material in practice questions. She enthusiastically encourages students to spend time working on a problem before she reveals the answer and explanation. When she does this, she'll ask if anyone is open to sharing the answer they got, often trying to get new people to speak.","After every topic we talk about he asks students to verify what they have read or heard, and then to give their own opinion. He also asks the students to build off of other statements and give their own so we can get more ideas out on the floor.","Every class no matter what the topic is, everyone is asked to come up with ideas or an opinion. Not everyone but usually a hand full of students share their answers with the class.","Every Thursday a group of 2 students do a presentation on whatever topic we're talking about for the week in front of the whole class and at the end of each presentation there are some reflection questions for the students to answer regarding the presentation. Sometimes students volunteer to answer the questions and other times the proffessors will pick students to answer questions and share their ideas with the whole class.","Our instructor emphasizes that we speak up and answer questions based on our knowledge and opinions which creates an atmosphere of exchanging knowledge for the growth of individuals. We do this every week and in exchange we have made friendships with the people around.","She has asked us questions and some people answer"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

With this tool, students are allowed to help out other students and teach each other concepts.","There are \" Active Learning \" slides in the powerpoint where students are supposed to bounce ideas back and forth to come up with what we think is the correct answer.","We always talk to classmates who sit next to us. I think this is an opportunity to respond classmates' ideas.","Our lectures often have interactive parts. Whether it's talking with a small group or partner, we often have ti respond to other ideas and questions asked about chemistry. I think it helps a lot because we can see what other people think and get other perspectives on what we are leaning and maybe we figure out something that we didn't understand before. The professor usually just addresses for us to discuss with people around us whenever one of these moments arises","For our warm - ups she has us ask each other a question that she has on the projector. Also, during the lecture, she will have us ask each other what a specific concept means or how to solve a problem.","We would breeak out into partners after she asked a question and answer   questions, talk, and give each other feedback. This happens a time during class. \n","We have Ed - discussion where students can ask questions about chemistry problems or topics, and other students are welcome to answer those questions. Most of the responses from other students are very helpful and reliable.","Students are able to post questions they have to [Removed]. Students can respond to each other's questions here.","We are encouraged to deal to each other and help each other understand topics we may have initially thought to be confusing. When classmates are confused on a lecture question their neighbors help them understand.","We would talk about every question type with each other","During lecture we have active learning where we try and do a problem with the person sitting next to us. We also discuss what the potential answers are during various parts of lectures.","On canvas, there is a place for us to ask questions and have other students, TA's, or the professor to respond.","Dr. [Removed] always asks students to discuss topics with students during class after any major idea is taught.","She always give questions in the lecture and time to discussion with the neighbors before she tells the answers.","The professor used the ed discussion page so that people in the class can ask questions and have them answered for everyone","In every class, there are times where you can talk to the person near you. This time can be used to ask each other and respond to their questions. The instructor has said multiple times to talk with those around you about the ideas covered.","gives questions on class to work on with classmates","Almost every class, she dedicates some time for students to discuss lecture material with eachother to get a better understanding of each other's points of views.","The instructor asks the students at least once per class to discuss and work with a partner / in groups on a problem","The teacher makes us talk to each other to solve problems together and share ideas. This enables to us to correct each other if we are mistaken or wrong. This usually happens every class. She asks us to talk to each other.","During each class she asks for feedback, but this is a very large class so we usually don't raise our hand but instead blurt out.","Dr. [Removed] has asked students to respond to classmate's ideas or questions throughout the lecture. I don't remember her doing it this past week but she does do it at times.","While we learn a concept we are asked to discuss what we think with our classmates. This usually happens 1 - 3 times per lecture. The professor asks us to specifically do something or discuss something with the people around us.","She asks a questions towards the students and wants us to answer in response. She wants to know if we understand.","Dr. [Removed] would ask for student answers for many problems. Based on the answers, she could bounce the question back to students or answer the question herself. This is very common during lecture. \n","The instructor will ask us to speak to our peers about a topic and build off of each others understanding.","Since the class is so big it's hard to do something like this but she often asks meaningful questions for discussion with people next to us","Dr. [Removed] always asks students to discuss with peers.","There would be questions for the class to think about and you would respond and discuss with other classmates.","When were doing the learning slides may instructor will ask a question and give us time to talk with our classmates about the material","asked us to talk to our partners about the topic","During slideshow presentations, they include a segment to communicate thoughts to neighbors. She also lets us work through problems together as a class.","If we raise our hand, the teacher will answer. During short discussion though, the ta's basically just expect you to understand your own question.","[Removed]","Dr. [Removed] uses [Removed] Discussion. On the first day, she introduced this platform and encouraged students to answer each other's questions on [Removed].","Our class is a very large lecture style class, but we do get time during the lecture to discuss and work out practice problems with people around us to engage with the material a little bit more. We do this at least a few times every class.","The professor would have an \" active learning \" page on the board where students are asked to practice what we just learned to ensure we understand the material. We are encouraged to then communicate with our neighbors after attempting the problem and discuss our answers. This happens roughly 2 - 3 times a class.","Whenever she goes over a few slides from her presentations, she will tell us to discuss with the person next to us about a practice problem","The instructor frequently has students discuss practice problems amongst themselves.","During discussions, the professor would frequently encourage students to engage with each other's ideas by asking, \" Does anyone want to build on that point? \" or \" Can someone respond to what was just said? \" This happened both in live class sessions and in online discussion boards. By fostering this interaction, the instructor created a collaborative environment where students felt comfortable responding to and expanding on their classmates' contributions, helping to deepen the overall conversation. \n","The instructor often asks students to discuss various practice problems / learning activities with fellow classmates for a few minutes after learning the concept. This usually happens at least once a class period. During this time, students can communicate with their classmates and respond to their opinions and ideas.","In the [Removed] page for the course there is a discussion board where students can ask questions outside of class. The professor said she encouraged students to answer each other's questions.","Our professor asked us to discuss between one another one of the questions placed on the board. We were to discuss the idea behind the question then work together to solve the question. That's how the professor stated we had to tackle the problem","One times I answered a question and she asked the class on any ideas on how I got there, I believe that this most likely helped students who are lost to catch up.","She normally proposes a question and gives us time to think about it. She then gives us time to discuss and ask the people around us.","She might ask for volunteers to answer a question, speculating what exceptions to rules look like, or how different concepts in chemistry relate to each other. Then, she would ask students to discuss with the person next to them their own thoughts on the matter, and what they thought of the volunteer's proposal.","The professor has been in the middle of lecturing and explaining a completely new concept and stopped to have us discuss the concept.","The instructor utilizes a lot of active learning questions. In these students are able to practice problem solving skills while also collaborating with other students helping to respond to ideas and or questions.","Dr. [Removed] did this last class and asked us for a memorization technique for a topic and to talk amongst ourselves to help learn a topic. She made sure to do this so that we learned the topic well.","Our chemistry course has an [Removed] discussion page. Students are able to ask questions in which TAs mostly respond however, fellow students may also respond if they understand the content.","We pair up and discuss practice questions","This happens within almost every class. When Dr. [Removed] goes over a tricky concept, she tells us to talk about it with those around us.","Usually at least once per lecture, we would have an example question in our presentation, where we would discuss the answer with our classmates. Here, we get to discuss about possible answers and methodically talk to one another on how we got to our answers.","Every class the professor gives practice problems, and then after having us work on the solution individually, she will have us compare answers and communicate about the topic to the people next to us","This happens almost every class. We break into small groups and discuss the questions she has or onto the board. At this time, we're able to ask any questions.","Every class, the professor will give us time to discuss certain content or problem with our peers. During this time, we are able to ask / answer each other's questions and collaborate.","In every lecture, we get intervals from the material to discuss questions that she will ask us with the people around us. Not only does she do this but there is an online program called [Removed] in which students can anonymously send in questions about the material or the lectures and other students or the professor will respond with an answer helping the student. This program has saved me before a test numerous times as I can just scroll through and find out new information that me and other peers were wondering.","we do problems and discuss with our neighbor","Dr. [Removed] presents a question on the screen and tells us to try to solve the problem with our peers during every lecture","She will have us discuss a question between each other and then ask our response to the questions. she does this every class at least 2 times.","Just had us work together in groups to answer a question","During every lecture, she makes us discuss concepts with the people next to us often to further out understanding of the topic.","Dr. [Removed] asks us to share with each other every class. We discuss the content that we are learning and reason through multiple answers together.","On canvas there is a [Removed] link where student can post questions about anything in the course. Students are able to respond to other students questions as well as the tas to help everyone succeed in the class together.","There have been times where a student asks the professor a question and then the professor asks sometime in the class if they can answer the question. I am not completely sure this has occurred though.","Typically she tells us to write down our questions and ask them after class or during office hours","She lets us talk to each other and share ideas. If we have a question for our partners than they answer it, but never has she called on someone to answer a question a person has asked.","The professor asks us often to share ideas with our classmates and work through problem. For example one time we were asked to draw a chemical structure and the professor encouraged us to ask our classmates and talk through any issues solving the question.","The instructor would propose a question and ask us to discuss it with classmates before explaining it herslef \n","At least twice per class, Dr. [Removed] has us split up into pairs to talk about a question that she asks us. She encourages us to ask each other questions if we are unsure about the material and work through our confusion together. Of course there are also TAs walking around to answer our questions if any remain unanswered.","Discuss amongst each other the answers to practice problems and how we got that.","Dr. [Removed] does this repeatedly during every single class. There is not a moment in time where she does not ask students to respond to a certain idea or question. I like it because it keeps me engaged as well as the class.","She will often have us do a problem with the people next to us before we do it as a class. It is encouraged to work together at these times.","In small groups, we respond to classmates' ideas or questions. There is also an online forum for people to ask questions, but I'm not sure if students can respond to those.","During class the professor does ask the students to talk to their neighbors and talk about how we want to answer the question and collabriote off of eachother to answer the questions.","She always has breaks to have us discuss with the people next to us and allow us the opportunity to try to solve on our own. She then goes over the correct way to do it and why","We were asked to split off and talk to our neighbors to work on specific questions on the board based on fairly new material. Since the material was just introduced, I relied on bouncing off ideas to the people around me and, after a few moments, was brought back by the professor to review the answer.","If a student answers a question Dr. [Removed] will ask the class if we agree or not. If someone does not agree they are free to share their opinion.","As a class we answer questions together, and she tells us to work in groups. This happened on monday.","Dr. [Removed] would ask us to talk to the students around us and spread ideas.","She asked us to turn to our neighbors and talk about certain concepts","We have specific times during lectures to discuss with our peers and learn from each other","In class, Professor [Removed] will have us talk to each other and work through a problem provided, giving us time to help each other and ask each other questions.","We converse in class after she asks us a question. She tells us to confirm with a neighbor about what we talked about.","Sometimes she would ask us to turn to our partners and share our answers. This happens usually ever class whenever she asks us a question.","This happened in [Removed] when Dr. [Removed] asked us to share with the person next to us what our solution was for the chemistry problem displayed on the screen. During this activity, I was able to respond to the classmate's ideas through the brief time provided to discuss amongst ourselves.","When we go through the examples in the notes, she asks us to work out the problems with the people sitting next to us. This encourages to respond to their ideas on what they think the answer is, or help them if they have any questions.","During each class professor [Removed] has the students talk about the questions in the slides we are going through. This helps us to formulate ideas instead of just being given the answers. \n","In the course, the instructor frequently facilitated discussions where we were asked to respond to each other's ideas and questions, particularly during weekly online forums. For example, after posting our initial thoughts on a reading, the instructor would prompt us with, “ Now, please respond to at least two of your classmates' posts — add to their ideas, ask a clarifying question, or offer a different perspective. ” This encouraged deeper engagement with the material and helped create a collaborative learning environment where everyone's voice was heard. \n\n\n\n","A practice question appeared on the slides during lecture and Dr. [Removed] encouraged us to work through the problem with the people around us. She would after explain the correct answer.","We do turn and share to either ask questions or just have a conversation about a topic","We'll split into small groups to work on problems. During this time, we're able to share ideas and questions.","At start of class, professor will ask student to describe some concept","We have discussions in class about specific practice problems","I love caudill. she makes students feel welcomed.","This never really happens during class except for when we are able to talk to our peers.","This isn't direct, but during instapolls we're encouraged to work on problems together and respond to each others ideas and to teach each other. Doing so is a way of responding to each other's ideas or questions.","Sometimes during lectures students raise their hand and respond out loud to the whole class and ask for other ideas.","The instructor encourages us to talk about the material in class while we complete our instapoll","Before she answers the practice problem she asks us to try ourselves first.","To describe the change in enthalpy and entropy","It happens pretty much every class when she lectures.","We have this thing called [Removed], and it gives us an opportunity to ask each other questions and respond to other students. He also gives us time to ask questions before the lecture and after and after each slide.","I really don't remember anytime in which we have been asked to respond to any classmates","During our activities where we are usually visualizing posters or our soil, she encourages us to respond. She does this by waiting for the question to be answered by one of us.","The teaching instructor asks the lab section a question and then has us respond aloud or has us discuss in groups.","I think this was when we were looking at previous student's research posters and she would ask us what we rated it and why. We went around as a table in the classroom ( one person per table ) would answer that question.","The instructor confirms why a student thinks something should be done this way. The class is active learning and hands so, so it is important to know for example why something needs to be done to limit contamination.","[Removed] will often ask for other students to comment on what someone said or asked. She will call on tables frequently.","We use perusal every week, which is like a discussion board where we write responses to questions and comment on classmates responses.","Often times our lab groups need to discuss our results with each other and what that means for our overall research. These conversations are often started by questions posed by [Removed] to the entire class.","Let's student lead some of the open ended discussions","The instructor has asked us all to provide answers to questions. They asked us something to the effect of \" Can anyone tell me about gram staining \" and a student answered. They then followed up with \" Can anyone explain more about crystal violet ( something specific but I forgot ) \" and another student responded and built on the original classmates' response","We have sometimes had group discussions and when one person didn't know the TA opened up the discussion to the whole class. Other classmates were invited to respond and share their ideas.","In some lectures we were encouraged to speak with our classmates or provide answers to any questions they may have. My classmates answered many questions that I had or elaborated on my ideas.","At the beginning of the lab, our instructor gives a small lecture on what we will cover in class for the day. Following this, she provides an open floor time so students can ask questions and bounce off each other's ideas.","The point of group work is to build off of each other. Every class the students would work with their lab group or ask questions to neighboring lab groups in order to continue through the experiment.","On [Removed] we're instructed to respond to classmates and add to what they've said.

We've had to analyze these to determine the identity of an atom.","When going over the different equations and conversions we were asked to use them in specific questions to give wavelength, frequency, or other things the question might be asking you.","never remember mentioning it","She puts a mathematical equation for us to solve up on the screen.","We have analyzed all types of graphs, bohr models, and equations.","I don't remember words, but she has had us do several different mathematical equations and data.","In quizzes, modules, and on exams we do this. We also do it on [Removed] during lecture. \n","Yes, students have analyzed and interpreted scientific and mathematical data within this course. She has learning modules that we can. practice analyzing this information on in order to help us.","On our test and during the lectures so far, we are encouraged to interpret scientific data pertaining to chemistry. We analyze multiple different things and try to come up with why they might occur.","Spectroscophy of different atoms, first unit, and we would look at different examples of visible light spectrums of atoms to identify them.","I don't recall a specific moment.","The instapolls given in class would force us to analyze data and preform mathematical problems. This would usually happen in the middle of class after talking about the specific topic.","We looked at molecules that were made using a bonding kit. Based on the shape of the molecule, we had to determine if it was polar or nonpolar","We have to look at different graphs, models, and charts, and analyze them.","Usually after finishing a part of the lecture, we get given a practice problem usually with a molecular formula or a model of a molecule and we have to discuss the question and decide what that molecule would look like or how it would behave.","During lectures, the instructor would ask us problems dealing with math equations or analyzing models in chemistry. This helped to see if we were understanding and keeping up with the lecture.","Most of our assignments, practice problems, and lectures include scientific data and mathematical models for us to solve. I feel like this is expected from a class like this. It happens in our homework, quizzes, exams, and lectures.","Sprinkled throughout the lectures, she usually has practice problems for us to try and to, either individually or with the people around us. Sometimes it can be troubling because she expects us to know some things before hand.","When learning about the different lewis structures for each molecule, Dr. [Removed] had us look at the model, and break down what bonds, angels, and polarity, each [Removed] [Removed] had. She also gives us time to stop and review the models by telling us to \" spend about 2 minutes talking with a neighbor in order to try out an equation \" for ourselves.","Whenever we examine a chemistry concept in class, there are generally models or practice problems involving data that we must evaluate. This allows for interpretation of models and data in the context of what we discuss.","We analyzed hybridized orbitals, molecular and electronic geometry, and bonding patterns in units 2 and 3. Dr. [Removed] told us : \" look at this molecular model and tell me what molecular geometry it has. \"","I can not remember a specifc time","Oftentimes we look at examples on powerpoints that include data / math models. This happens weekly depending on the unit.","My instructor does this within her assignments. She embeds them in the form of questions.","She provides in depth descriptions using examples and practice scenarios to help us understand the material better.","When she would give us examples for problems that included math. We also have examples for problems where we have to interpret them.","Especially with chemistry, there are a lot of instances where we have to analyze scientific data. A lot of this has to with bonds which we learned about in October, and thermodynamics requires an analysis of systems, which we have been learning about most in November and December.","We would have to interpret the theoretical or scientific content given almost always within a mathematical model. Whether that be with a graph, assigning quantitative energy values to certain bonds or processes, or an equation.","Throughout the class, the instructor presents a few word problems that the students have to interpret and solve to get to the answer. This is done in every class so students can actively engage with the new material and understand which areas to focus on. Word problems throughout class are not graded, so it does not pressure students to get to the right answer, but weekly quizzes are more challenging.","[Removed]","Every time we are analyzing chemistry, math models and equations are necessary.","During each lecture we are given lecture questions to discuss and solve on our own that make us interpret scientific data. After a couple minutes the prof goes over them","There were lots of charts and models of lewis structures.","We use scientific data to relate to our learning. We apply what we learn to see hoiw they work in real world examples using scientific data.","Sometimes lecture slides include scientific data, graphs, or other forms of models that relate to our course content and help us apply our learning. Sometimes graphs model real life situations and other times it models relevant data that we are asked to interpret and grasp.","She shows us examples of things relevant to the topics we are going over and uses data to show us how it's used in real life","She shows us a lot of graphs. There s always a lot of data tables","not specifically \" data \" but she makes sure we know how to analyze models. \n","I misread the question and clicked the wrong option.","Dr. [Removed] had students do this recently. When we analyze or interpret data or models, Dr. [Removed] gives the class a couple of minutes to discuss with others a problem or equation she presented to us. This allows us to practice and better understand freshly learned material in the lecture.","We would look at models on the projector and were told to figure out what the meant.","The instructor showed examples of a chemistry concept and then asked us to analyze it and interpret it according to context clues and background knowledge. This has happened more than once.","Whenever there is a diagram on her presentation, she will ask us to interpret it ourselves before explaining it to us","The instructor would show us some chemical compounds or molecules and ask us to determine the answer. This happens like nearly every class.","i do not remember the last time","During every lecture, the professor would include practice problems on the lecture slides that we work through as a class after our independent thinking times. For example, the professor would then ask the students to determine how many valence electrons are in a specific chemical formula and ask us to explain why.","Never mind I read that wrong, she did that","She has us workout and draw problems on our own before we meet together to discuss to make our brains move.","In this course, the instructor provided a chart with different wavelengths of light and allowed the class the opportunity to interpret the meaning of the chart. This exercise took place at the beginning of the first unit when we were learning about hydrogen's emission spectrum. The instructor displayed the chart on the screen and asked the class to discuss the chart.","There would be practice problems in class and on the homework assignments / study guides. These are helpful in applying real life examples and helps understand the information better.","She has asked us on several occasions to use the chemical formula given to create a scientific model of a compound. Then, using past principles, we had to interpret scientific data from the model we created, such as the compound's hybridization.","When it comes to understanding theories or analyzing scientific data that involves theories, she will have insta polls asking question in regards to the topic with intention of having students analyze the math and either write in sentences or choose an answer on multiple choice. If not, then we are expected to talk to our classmates and discuss how it is that we got the answer from a question or how would we find the answer to the question by giving us a few minutes to think about it and discuss. If not, then we are also told to do a question by ourselves.","I'm pretty certain this has happened in lecture before. If not, the learning modules and content will eventually cover this.","We often problem solve together during in class polling","She provides graphs and then asks us to analyze them, then explains them to us.","As a class we take time to look at questions for question types we need to know for the exam. Dr. [Removed] lets us talk with our peer and dicuss the questions which I find really benifical.","They were explaining the change in enthalpy and change in entropy and what it meant for a reaction to be spontaneous. This happened last class and the instructor told us we could rely on our intuition for how to solve these problems or utilize the mathemathical model by plugging in arbitrary numbers.","During lectures, there is scientific data present in the powerpoint. Our instructor asks us question based on this info during the lecture times which requires us to analyze.","The instructor presents different data in lectures and on online learning modules. This happens relatively on the learning modules, but every once in a while in lectures.","We were talking about endothermic and exothermic reactions. And the Teacher asked us to look at energy graphs of chemical reactions and asked us to identify exo vs endothermic reactions. This happened a few weeks ago. The instructor told us to talk to our classmates about the graph.","Occasionally, our instructor would put graphs or draw models to help us understand the material within the lecture. This helps expand our knowledge and understanding of the content.","Since chemistry has a lot of scientific data and mathematical elements, there are often moments in lecture that we must analyze models and use data.","We would often get graphs and models throughout the course that we would have to analyze and interpret to extrapolate information.","In this class, we study equations and other topics that involve mathematical approaches and would collect data. This has occurred recently in the course about gas laws.","Professor [Removed] assigns insta - polls in class that allow us to answer questions on the spot. I think that this is an effective way of allowing everyone to socialize and understand what we think of the question.","During lectures we were asked to use the things we had learned in the learning modules to figure out answers to problems presented.","We analyze different models on tests and quizzes. In our study guides, there are also various mathematical models and scientific data for us to analyze.","During the lectures there will be problems that are inputted throughout the slides to help learn how to solve with certain equation's. This helps the class better understand the process of solve for a specific answer.","In the thermo unit, we covered different graph models to showcase the scenarios as well as molecular structures in another unit","During in class practice questions, she pulls out a table or graph and we are tasked to analyze it and understand why.","Dr. [Removed] has shown graphs of different relationships between characteristics of a gas, such as PV = nRT. She also went over how different variables affect each other mathematically.","We are given graphs sometimes that have scientific data and evidence. We are asked to dissect this data and come to a conclusion.","Usually embedded in the learning modules, the professor includes models for aid. Analyzing these models help deepen the understanding of the subject. \n","During pretty much every lecture we are given data, or a graph to look at that supports whatever we are learning.","in this class, we had to analyze models and the work done on them. [Removed] made this enjoyable by using hand movements to help us understand better \n\n","Example questions with each other \n","Provided us with graphs to analyze, regarding the concepts we were currently studying. This happened prior to our Unit 3 exams in order to prepare for graphs we might see on the exam.","It depends on the unit when this occurs. Usually, we analyze graphs of endothermic and exothermic reactions. This happened last week but not this past week.","During class on 9/30, we learned about electronic geometry and molecular shapes. There were various charts on the lecture slides and we were asked to process the information and make an effort to memorize the different shapes.","Our instructor would give us practice problems available for us to see how to interpret data. Additionally, the instructor provided models for us to view so we can get a better understanding of the data.","We studied scientific data that is very simple, but relates to the course, and relates only to chemistry. We have not studied many scientific models, if any at all.","We are currently examining the structural atom models and structures, and we are required to use mathematical methods to solves the amount of lone pairs or to determine bond angles. Using this information we are able to determine what type of specific shape the atom is. For example, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, or linear.","Just this week in class, Dr. [Removed] had us draw specific [Removed] [Removed] for compounds and then analyze / interpret certain data. For example, our goal was to identify how many [Removed]'s the structure contained and what this meant for the molecular shape of the compound.","She had us interpret the data","Every single day of this class and every time I study for this course, there is extensive scientific data and mathematic modeling involved - especially in the current units revolving around structuring and electrons.","There are learning modules that we are instructed to do which have include a lot of scientific data to interpret. There are also plenty of mathematical models relating to the topic we are learning within each module.","In [Removed], during one of the early lectures on quantum mechanics, the instructor provided a set of graphs and data tables related to electron configurations and asked us to interpret trends in ionization energy across the periodic table. This was done during class, and we worked with the person next to us to draw conclusions, with the instructor guiding us through the thought process to ensure we understood how to interpret scientific data in this context.","My instructor typically has us understand the topics from models so we can better visualize what we are learning.","Professor [Removed] always makes us interpret mathematical models. She familiarizes us with certain mathematical equations that will be helpful for us during exams and throughout the course.","Our instructor made us analyze relevant math and scientific modules during lecture to be prepared for questions that could show up on tests. She let us attempt the problems first before explaining step by step how she got to the correct answer.","It feels more like a factor of the course in general? there's times in class where we discuss questions and how to address them, but I wouldn't say data as much as it is chemical formulas","During lectures, Dr. [Removed] implements this. She does this in many ways, through both her notes slides and the [Removed] she gives us time to answer with peers. Often, the questions have students analyze or interpret scientific data or mathematical models.","Within the learning lectures, there is occasionally mathematical model questions embedded within them. The professor gives us time to work over the questions alone, then works it through with us.","During class sometimes we'll do an experiment in which we will analyze what happens in the scenario.","I don't recall exactly what it was but I know we've done it","She showed us tables with the signs of [Removed] and [Removed] in a certain recation and told us to interpret it. She then explained the correct answer which helped with understanding.","She always makes us interepret data to make sure we understand the concept especially with endothermatics.","We do learning modules about topics and gt videos cover stuff we might not know.","In our course there are many times where we are reading scientific data as well as models to interpret during lecture, homework, and during tests.","There are always slides in the lecture powerpoints that allow us to collaborate with peers or TA's about the graphs / concepts we see. She then goes over them and we are allowed to ponder over the answers.","The instructor gave us practice during the lecture. We have to analyze the data and figure out the answer.","some science data we need to analyze appear on the [Removed] on the class","[Removed] gives us graphs and equations to look at and analyze in class every day","Examples of problems we solve with others","I do not recall this happening.","The most analyzing we would do in this class would be interpreting graphs that correspond with PV = nRT or now thermodynamics and different modules. Interpreting these models would occur in class, and the instructor would give us time to try to interpret the model without their assistance before she told us how to properly read the model.","In this course, we ( the students ) are regularly presented with charts and graphs where we must interpret what values represent or how to give meaning to charts and numbers. This is very helpful to this course as these topics may come up in exams and it is nice having a connection between chemical patterns and arithmetic.","On class give an example question and ask student do the math and get the answer","She provides many graphs and has us engage in discussion about what is going on","We analyze graphs that relate to our chemistry content, such as a PV graph. This happened in our Unit 3 class period.","I do not remember.","We studied graphs of materials and how they conduct heat","It happened while analyzing thermodynamic graphs and she provided an explanation after we spoke with peers.","During this course, Dr. [Removed] has her lecture slides where she provides several scientific data and models about the topic being taught that week. I don't remember exactly when this happened, yet I do remember seeing this data.","The general chem concepts requires for students to use mathematical models such as graphs or tables to further understand concepts.","Dr. [Removed] has us answer questions with the students around us and she has us attempt to understand equations prior to telling us how to read them. This helps us remember the equation and understand why we are using it and happens any class when we learn an equation. \n.","We did this during our unit on chemistry models and shapes. We had to analyze what shape a molecule was using intuition and scientific data","The instructor would post instapolls during class time and required us to answer the instapoll by analyzing or interpreting data.","We often look over scientific data models throughout the course. It can be very helpful for some students to see a certain topic represented in a model in order to grasp the concept. The amount of data we cover throughout the course has greatly contributed to many students' success and understanding of the material.","We learn analytical skills that are applicable to different classes.","Constantly reflecting on our colonies and how slight mess ups can affect the whole experiment. We are also allowed to compare colonies to eachother and discuss differences and comparisons.","We looked at previous years research posters.","We have to think about the different characteristics of our bacteria and try to understand what it means.","I would say that we have to do this for some pre - labs. When working on a pre - lab, you may have to interpret data to find an answer.","We have to analyze our observations in conclusions","Critical thinking required to analyze the results from soil master plates and co - culture plates.","One day in class we analyzed previous posters. It was a nice look into what we were doing for the rest of the semester. And it also showed us where our work was important.","After collecting data, we would analyze the data collected and what it meant.","We have to examine the growth of pur bacteria om different biochemical assays as long as once a week we would analyze any changes in morphology of our soil isolates.","[Removed] will often provide guiding questions on the board for us to use to ensure that we get the main point of the data and what we are doing. She also encourages us to talk with our lab mates and everyone around us so that we can collaboratively work together.","For each lab, we would always be told to interpret our results. Results could be observations or numerical.","Through our lab reports","I like this class very much","Every time we observed results in lab and had to interpret the results / what we were seeing.","Depends on the lab, but we do interpret what we see.","In lab, we are normally tasked with understanding numbers and data and then applying that knowledge to find a solution.","N / A","Before lab we always have a pre - lab to do where we have to analyze data. We also have to analyze bacteria colonies during lab as well as writing reports based on the results.","During the prelab, there would be tables that needed to be observed and also graphs. After reviewing the tables, we then had to answer questions based on what was in the tables.","[Removed] would make sure the students took notes on the morphologies of the colonies. One time I did not take notes and [Removed] made sure I went back to the table and record the morphologies.","We examine our master pates regularly and have calculated [Removed]'s, total isolates, percentages of certain morphologies, and more using our given data.","Every day in lab we collect our data from the experiments performed, at the end of the week we have a lab report that allows us to interpret all of this data and relate it to the overall goal of our research.","During the pre - labs, there were certainly questions where students had to analyze or interpret scientific data / mathematical models. In fact, I remember one from the most recent lab that required us to do so.","Since this a lab based class we analyze and interpret scientific data everyday in our class. We conduct experiments and then analyze our results afterwards and see how we can improve.","Provide data with us","Look at examples of student posters and see graphs.","We often interpret scientific data such as morphology every day.","In the ethics discussions as well as our research reports we either needed to discuss scientific data or talk about the ethics behind it. For the annotated bibliography we had to complete, we also had to interpret scientific data.","We don't exactly look at scientific data but look at real world examples of the techniques we are using in lab. This recently happened during the gram staining unit as we observed real gram stained specimens.","We write our lab reports and do this","We calculated [Removed] for our soil streak isolations.","We analyzed scientific data while searching for our scholarly sources to cite our research poster","We record notes in our lab notebook during every lab about our scientific observations.","Basically make us understand what we have discovered on our isolates and what type of bacteria it is and why we thought it was this.","This course was very insightful and I would definitely recommendz","she gave us a lot of opportunities to analyze and calculate our data, notably when we had to calculate our [Removed]'s.","We are currently doing a project where we need to interpret data taken from [Removed] students to see if there's a difference in how continuous and discrete traits are represented in data. We also compared each others' graphs of the data in class.","Dr. [Removed] had us do a project where we analyzed continuous and discrete traits and display these data on graphs","The only time we did this was for a project with data collected from a survey for discrete and continuous traits. But the teacher didn't involve and we spen time outside class woring on it. So nothing was really explained.","In the past, we were given charts for complementation or supplementation for example and asked to determine the order of genes using the given data. We often interpret charts or graphs, such as a graph for age and mutations for male and female, and we were asked to analyze trends. Dr. [Removed] said, \" discuss with your group. \"","One project from this course involved creating graphs and interpreting scientific data that was collected from the class. Also, we have had to complete many math equations to better understand genetics.","The first project assignment, due this week, involves analyzing our class's data regarding height, presence of a Y chromosome, and colorblindness. The project's intentions are to determine the differences in the ways continuous and discrete traits are distributed among a population.","Everyday in class we go over practice problems revolving around scientific data. This greatly improves my procedural knowledge and problem solving skills.","During the course this week, students were assigned a spreadsheet of data from the class and asked to create graphs and figures to analyze them with. Students then compared their graphs in class to gain ideas and insight. In previous weeks students analyzed [Removed] squared and pedigrees to derive information from them.","We had a project ( first project around week 4 of the course ) where we put class data into models we thought fit best. Instructor was lenient and encouraging.","Our first project required us to analyze class data related to gender, height, and colorblindness. This project was due last week. She took time to detail what the project was and how the flexibility in its completetion","In this course, data is very prevalent and is something we focused heavily on as we completed a project that required us to be well - versed in [Removed] spreadsheets and analyze data in ways we hadn't before. We were required to compare data statistically, describe the variables, etc. for data relating to our class. The instructor was very helpful as she gave us time to discuss these topics with our group as well as went over the basics to the class as a whole.","We have had several questions where the scenario of the genetic disease / mutation was given and we had to analyze what the genetic inheritance was.","We had a project this past week that required us to analyze and create our own graphs.","During discussion sessions, the problems worked on used statistical math to calculate expectancy rates. The TA worked through problems when requested.","The instructor had us do a project where we analyzed the data from a survey asking whether the person taking the survey had a Y chromosome, their height, and whether they could see the numbers in the image. This happened about two weeks ago.","Our project was all about analyzing distributions. It allowed us to understand scientific and mathematical models.","Our first project is about analyzing our class data. We were able to create charts and form a hypothesis about the information given, and see how what we learned applies to other scenarios.","We recently finished our Project 1, in which we analyzed data from students within our class to determine the difference in discrete vs. continuous traits.","Towards beginning of the course we discussed out first project which involved taking data and making graphs.","For our second project, we had to research genetic conditions, the affected genes, and the proteins they code for. Through this project we had to learn how to read and interpret information from gene databases.","We were given a project to complete which included gathering data from a survey we were given. Then, we had to analyze this data through graphs and interpret scientific meanings and conclusion behind the data.","Our 2nd project was about researching a genetic condition and like the proteins associated with it. We had to look at the structure and composition so I'd consider that interpreting scientific data.","Through the experiments that we learn about in class, we analyze and interpret scientific data. We also do this through our projects where we may collect our own data and analyze it.","We do projects, and the first one involved using survey data and finding mathematical results.","Dr. [Removed] always supplies us with helpful and informative graphs and models to broaden our knowledge in the course. Just recently, we had a lab due where the main objective was making and interpreting graphs.","A significant part of our grade in the class are two labs. These include us having to interpret scientific data and make graphs.","Had us analyze class data for an assignment a few weeks ago.","We use the topics from in - class and we learn about how they apply to real - life situations. One example of this is examining a family tree and determining what kind of trait is being passed down. We would have class time to talk about this with our group members, and then the professor would discuss the right answer and always answer questions that the students would have.","Using instapoll so we can answer questions using scientific models of genetics","We have to use probability to analyze genetic trees and crosses. This incorporates science and math in one question.","Dr. [Removed] had us, for our first lab, look through data that the class had put together. We had to create graphs of said data and describe any trends that we saw and how these variables looked different in the population.","Dr. [Removed] gives us a lot of mathematical problems to solve during class. She walks us through the steps to solving.","This occurred in an assignment we were assigned this week. We were asked to create graphs for data and analyze it.","Instructor has students draw diagrams of chromosomes and [Removed] replication.","She has us analyze pedigrees and other data and answer questions about it.","During lecture every class day a lot of the material includes graphs that reflect different aspects of a genome sequencing result or other wet lab experiments. We are expected to know how to analyze these graphs to derive information about it.","We have done labs in which we interpret data in the past week.","About two weeks ago when our topic was going over large databases to study genetic codes on a website and the scientific data that comes with the genes.","Today in class we looked at mutant distributions in germ vs somatic cells","We have to analyze Sangwer sequencing and like models","We were looking at DNA sequencing fragment graphs and analyzing how that related detecting ddNTPs in DNA sequences. Dr. [Removed] walked us through how different base sequences corresponded to different peaks and colors on the graph.","It happened during one of our classes, and we had to interpret genetic differences of certain mutation of a genetic sequence from a genome library. It was during last week's classes and professor said this will be helpful for future learnings.","In the first unit of the course, there was a lot of math involved. We had to calculate the probability of traits. She also curved the quizzes and exams for us to grow, which is beneficial.","We are constantly learning new formulas and finding out how those formulas were derived.   Whenever we are learning new mathematical models in class he usually always asks us beforehand what the mathematical model might be before writing it down for us.   We are usually always thinking critically in class guided by the questions he throws our way.","We have a lot of formulas we use and the instructor will often ask us what certain components stand for and how to derive formulas to solve for what we want.","In our physics class, models, wether that be free - body diagrams or simply models being used in problems, are used abundantly. With that said, Dr. [Removed] puts an emphasis on being able to draw out a problem in order to better visualize it and in turn, make it easier to solve for what a problem may be asking for.","We have gone over [Removed]'s laws and have worked on many physics problems going through different equations.","He asks us to analyze what the question to a problem is asking. He also guides us.","When we were in class last week. He had us look at the axis of the earth and how it can affect its inertia and energy.","Our instructor had us look through different mathematical models and interpret them. This helped us understand different physics concepts.","Dr. [Removed] includes examples in the written notes we take during lecture after he introduces the new topic. Then, we are able to talk amongst our peers and figure out which statistical equation we need to use for the example problem. After we discuss amongst ourselves, he asks the class to explain what we came up with and eventually solves the problem using the right mathematical model.","Lots of models troughout the course","Physics. It has mathematical equations and models. We have to try to understand and apply that knowledge.","In our course, after we did not perform well on the midterm, the instructor provided an opportunity to redo it for extra credit. This approach not only allowed us to analyze and interpret the scientific data from the midterm but also fostered teamwork and support among students. Such an opportunity could be valuable in other courses, as it encourages learning from mistakes and emphasizes the importance of collaboration.","This normally happens when we are connecting concepts and he brings up equations that can be connected to [Removed]'s Laws and how they are connected.","We are taught the derivation of each equation we use in the class. All of the concepts are exploring mathematical models.","We have been critically thinking about all the models we use through t the week. The instructor always is to formulate are own thoughts before helping us follow a logical breakdown","While we do complete many example problems in class, none of them involve large scale analysis of a situation.","Lots of homework problems","What he does within his course is he tells us to draw a model with our questions so we can understand what is happening. He does it with every new thing we learn.","all the questions we get are based on application to outside world things","He was lecturing on velocity and acceleration earlier this month. He was describing and showing us time and position graphs.","The instructor has stuednts analyze scientific and mathematical models every class period. The point of physics is to analyze and interpret the math and science behind the processes that drive the existence of the world around us.","Our professor will often use spacecrafts to expand our knowledge of physics. He will often explore the [Removed] missions and show video clips or images comparing how the concepts and math we learn in class relate ( at the basic level ).","He had us analyze the moment of inertia of the [Removed] after being given models of different shapes. He asked us to recall what we know about the density of the earth and apply it to the shapes given","Dr. [Removed] will show us a demo on the topic being covered, I understand the point is to have a deeper and more applicable understanding of the material, however it really doesn't help relate to the equations and difficulty of the problems he gives us.","We have done so in all the [Removed] questions provided.","The professor always shows and explains models visualizing biological processes. He also includes these models in squarecap sessions and instructs students to interpret them.","In the course, the instructor introduced a complex dataset related to climate change trends during a mid - semester module. Students were divided into small groups to analyze the data and create visualizations to present their findings. Before starting, the instructor emphasized, \" Focus on identifying patterns and correlations, and be prepared to explain your reasoning during the presentations. \"","We looked at charts last week about enzymes rates. He told us what factors changed the rates.","On tests, homeworks, and in class activities. We have to analyze graphs / charts related to biology.","Usually, at least once every [Removed] session and multiple times on the test, he would give us mathematical graphs describing certain biological reactions or relationships and ask us to draw conclusions from the graph or explain why certain things might be happening in the graph. One of the more recent examples would be when he showed us four graphs with multiple lines on each and he asked us to conclude which hospital was the most effective at utilizing a certain drug to treat a bacterial disease, or something similar to that.","In the course we learn about different biological molecules and have to interpret what their function and structure will be. Dr. [Removed] made sure to ask us after lecture was done in a series of different questions. This was during our biological cell functions chapters.","In class this week 8/14 we analyzed a graph of enzyme velocity over concentration. Dr. [Removed] then went over the graph after we answered the squarecap question.","In this class, there are formulas' that will be covered for certain topics. However, it is more important and made clear by the instructor that you understand how they work conceptually rather than just plugging in numbers.","In our in - class [Removed], we are provided with multiple questions to test our understanding of the material. We are often given data or a math model that we must use to find an answer.","In the course, the instructor had us analyze a set of chemical reaction rates, asking, “ What trends do you see in the data, and how can you explain them? ” This occurred during a lesson on kinetics, where we interpreted the data to understand the factors affecting reaction speed. The instructor guided us to draw conclusions from the patterns we identified.","In our squarecaps, which are brief quizzes given at the end of each class, we are given about 10 questions we must answer, and many of the times these questions do include some sort of scientific data or mathematical model we are supposed to analyze. The data or model will be discussed when the professor goes over the quiz questions at the end of class.","Dr. [Removed] gives daily in class questions online through [Removed]. There is almost always a question where we have to analyze a graph or comprehend a paragraph from a scientific paper.","During in class activities on [Removed] and during exams, we are often given charts, graphs, or diagrams and asked to interpret the meaning of the figure or derive data from it. Occasionally we are asked to do basic calculations, such as calculating molecular weight or concentrations.","In the [Removed] assignments, there are some graph analysis questions.","Within the course we have daily square cap sessions which quizzes students on the lecture we had that day. A lot of the time, scientific models like graphs based on experiments, etc are presented and we are asked to solved questions based on our analysis.","He has daily activities that we can collaborate on with our peers and on those quizzes you must use application skills of what you just learned to get the answer right.","He asks questions via squarecap, discussion worksheets, and exams, which have graphs and asks us to interpret them.","In this course, we are learning to apply coding skills for data interpretation. This is done through finding certain data points, or creating visualizations of data and using these to interpret.","Everyday we analyze data and go over it and she explains it very well","She would have try it questions that would make us analyze and work a data set to reach a specific conclusion","I don't remember the specific lecture, but a lot of times the professor has working through R studio worksheets where we're given datasets and then asks use to create graphs / charts and then look at them to see if we could analyze / interpret them and pull some conclusions about the dataset.","this was done in worksheets, lab, and homework","Every single day we look at data, visualizations, and how to interpret those things.","We were given a dataset about earthquakes and had to manipulate it inorder to visual how different variables affected and were related to each other. The professor provided step - by - step teaching on how to do this. She frequently made sure everyone was caught up and understanding.","We look at different data everyday and currently using it for our project","Analyze statistical machine learning models like linear regression","Every class, she always starts with a model or real life example and asks us what is wrong with the figure or the code. It is helpful to start the class with because it gets me in the mindset of R studio \n","worksheets","During lecture when we do practice with data sets, during lab, as well as on the homework.","the instructor has a recap at the beginning of class regarding models learned from last class","During lan","Asks us to interpret what went wrong in code at the beginning of class","In class, we were analyzing the eruption of earthquakes. We spent a week covering this topic, using different mathematics models and data to learn to interpret and analyze the data.","Usually during every class, the instructor asks us to analyze the types of graphs we used and whether they represented the information well. We also had to analyze different datasets and represent them in different ways visually.","Throughout most of our class meeting we have analyzed numerous datasets. The most prominent one being about earthquakes. The data set covered magnitude, depth, location as well as other categories related to earthquakes.","What comes to mind is the [Removed] project we have been working on where we are applying what we have learned to datasets from the [Removed] of [Removed]. We were told to investigate relationships between data and draw conclusions from our results.","We do this every [Removed] in class. We always have worksheets provided in class with new data.","We make and look at visualizations and statistical models.","Professor [Removed] is fantastic at explaining different ways to display data and has introduced me to several new models to use. She also has been important in my understanding of when to use and how to apply such models.","n / a","We would walk through how a formula as determined in class but perhaps not analyze mathematical models ourselves","In every class we do worksheets in our course packet with our groups and then are asked to share in a google slides document for the entire class. We are asked to dicuss the questions together and analyze data sets that she gives us. This occured last class.","In the second lab when we went through data together \n","Can't remember specifically what it was but we have done this on the course packet","During class time, we are often tasked to do group work based on what we are learning about. During this time, we collaborate and try to find the correct answers based on given data.","It was during class when we were learning about how different variables are show in graphs. We had to describe data in bar graphs, histograms, etc. with data that was collected from a class survey.","It's a stats class, so she has us interpreting statistical models everyday. She explained the graph and how to read it.","Sometimes we will look at graphs or tables and have to figure things out such as the mean, shape, probabilites, etc.","Yes in group work","[Removed] exercises including the analysis of real - world datasets to interpret statistical results were assigned by the instructor. For example, they handed us a dataset after discussing linear regression and asked, \" Let's see how well you can apply what we've learned today. \" Usually, the lecturer would circulate the classroom throughout the second half of the lesson to provide supervision during this activity. We then talked about our results, and the lecturer cleared up any misunderstandings by highlighting how these methods are applied in actual scientific studies.","Each lecture includes examples from the real world that we use to practice the concepts learned in that class.","during lecture we are asked to analyze statistical models on our own and in groups","Often in class, we would discuss a problem together as students, then go over it in class with Dr. [Removed]. This would allow us to analyze the statistics and come up with methods to answer the question at hand.","In some lectures, when applicable, Professor [Removed] will project a model ( usually a graph ) of data and ask us to interpret what it is depicting, and how it relates to what we are calculating.","We analyze ecological graphs sometimes","In ecology we are taught to analyze data and unorthodox figures that ecologists use to present data. Usually each lecture has some sort of graph showing the different figures ecologists use for analyzing data.","Students were given data from [Removed] sites to create graphs from and analyze. Other graphs have also been provided for students to practice interpreting.","We had to analyze different graphs in multiple discussion sessions each week.","Through our [Removed] Notes we use multiple models, especially through excel. We do this in our discussion activities as well.","Last week, to study the [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] model, students worked on a handout in class with the students around them, after which the professor worked through the handout together with the class and posted a PDF and video key, since this was a more complicated topic. During discussion session, the TA also reviewed the [Removed] - [Removed] model and student did another handout which implement the [Removed] website to graphically model how the [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] graphs would look like under changing predator and prey population sizes.","in discussion sections analyzing different   math models","We have learned multiple mathematical models throughout the last month.","We do this in our ecology notes, which are a group assignment outside of class. She gives us feedback when grading.","We have projects called [Removed] Notes and those require us to find our own data from a set given that meets certain criteria. Then, we have to create a hypothesis, interpret the data and analyze it, and then understand what is happening with our analysis. We start these with our groups in discussion and work on it outside of discussion too.","One of our assingments required us to make graphs with data we acquired from different websites and had to make conclusions about the data. there are three assignments that require us to do this.","we look at many graphs and analyze them. Last week.","We often interpret graphs and models in class and during discussion session. She will ask us to analyze it ourselves, discuss it with peers, share answers, then she will share the correct answers.","We often do this as there are many material models to work with. Throughout the course I've worked with at least 6.","the instructor encourages us to look at tables and understand if certain species can cohabitate in an area based on the progeny numbers","an entire week was about this, and has happened a few times throughout the semester","This is the entire course in my opinion, so we see models every class as the majority of the notes. Additionally, we do ecology notes that require us to use mathematical models and excel then interpret the data.","We have studied 6 or 7 models relating to population size. Over the last 4 weeks we have covered this. She acknowledges that they are challenging but helps us through them.","For our ecology note, we must interpret data to draw conclusions about species diversity. Additionally, during lecture, Dr. [Removed] walked us through how to organize data.","During discussion, we used a real database to find data on [Removed] and [Removed] values in the [Removed] [Removed].","We did [Removed] [Removed] mathematical models on competition","This is a constant in lecture for all material. In class quizes and lecture notes all cover data and models to help us succeed and understand the material.","I'm thinking about the times we've needed to understand why certain equations work and the concepts behind them. This happens somewhat often, whenever we learn a new concept with an applicable model. I don't remember any specific words","Provided in - class quiz questions for attendance where students are asked to test their knowledge with various example models","The professor worked on notes on the projector, then applied the topic to an experimental model. Students answered questions through [Removed] regarding the content to have them critically think.","We have been analyzing mathematical models almost all semester. Its been expected though because it is a math course.","We interpret mathematical models in class regarding physics equations.","There are \" quiz \" questions that come up in every class and those are the times that we are able to analyze questions and apply our knowledge to them.","During discussion, the TA has us do practice problems and I feel like some questions could have involved scientific data.","[Removed] does this all the time by using printed out sheets that include the geometric models of conductors and insulators and how the charge distribution between them varies. It is not limited to those either, he makes sure to have images printed of most topics we go over. As for words, I do not feel comfortable enough to directly quote him. However, I found it to be useful","This happens in physics lab on a weekly basis, especially mathematical models. For the full class we derive equations and apply them to models to see how something may occur in the real world. Like the lightbulb test he did on October 3rd","It happens during every class when he pulls up an [Removed]. He teaches us content in class and then gives us concept questions for us to analyze and make further connections with the content in class. During the question, he often explains in further detail what the question asks and hints at us how to come to the right answer without directly giving an answer.","The instructor gave us [Removed] questions where we have to interpret data.","Our professor would show us real life charts of topics that he would be teaching in class which helps understand the concept more. Furthermore, he talks about very specific details that are shown in the charts that further improve the critical thinking of certain topics","parts of homeworks and instapoll","He provides models so the students can interpret what is being learned in a more realistic scope. When doing this, he asks us questions about the model and makes us answer as a class.","Unsrure","On discussion sections we must apply concepts we learned in class to worksheets that expand on the topic.","Students do this in the [Removed] and during the discussion portion of classtime. Dr. [Removed] encourages discussion multiple times.","Dr. [Removed] usually has equations that we discuss in class. For example, today he showed how an integral for work is interpreted as a graph.","The nature of the course questions requires you to often draw your own conclusions about the problem given prior knowledge of math concepts. As a result understanding of math models is a need for success in this class.","We would go through practice problems or example problems in the course. This would be at the beginning of class each day.","The [Removed] questions, mostly the conceptual ones, often have us logic our way through aspects of equations of natural laws. This is sometimes helpful, but I think would be much more valuable AFTER we've learned a topic.","Dr. [Removed] would have students analyze scientific data or mathematical models mostly in the pre - lecutures which have to be completed before class. We interpret the data or interact with the models, and turn in our responses to the question / s asked in the prelecture. In class, we'll go over what was covered in the prelecture and Dr. [Removed] would apply the material we are learning to the prelecture.","Analyzing data and mathematical models is an activity that often happens in class, usually at least once every lecture. Understanding physical systems is made much more helpful very often with these models and data, and we will often go over some in class or the homework, and of course very often in the assigned textbook.","The instructor used real values of thermal expansion coefficients ( of different materials ) to confirm the relationship between expansion rate and temperature. He gave us the problem to analyze on our own using previous knowledge of temperature and thermal expansion, and then went through the problem to solidify our understanding of it.","Recently in class, Dr. [Removed] had us try to interpret / analyze a mathematical model of entropy. He showed us different types of graphs relating to this model and had us try to understand the meaning behind them.","[Removed] the lecture Dr. [Removed] provides us many questions to think about and to interpret them with the information she has given us before. She does this so we can think about the topics more and understand it.","We have been asked to come up with scientist questions. When we were learning about how to come up with these questions, we were asked to read parts of articles and analyze what type of questions and what observations the author was making.","We would be provided data and models and she would detail what everything meant and where it came from.","I think I remember we once analyzed a picture in our discussion worksheets as a group and that was fun. I believe it was the second week of school.","We had read an article and were analyzing it. Then we interpreted it with each other.","There have been instances in discussions where students have had to interpret scientific data and then come up with a working hypothesis. During the most recent lecture, there was a model and question scenario accompanied by a multiple - choice question.","Last week for lecture 20, we were looking at an immune response / antibody chart. Thus, the main objective was to \" analyze or interpret scientific data \" with seeing which had \" memory immunity. \"","At one of our lectures last month we had to analyze a graph and explain why the trend was occuring.","During our lectures, Dr. [Removed] definitely includes many exercises in the slides for the students to participate in. Not only that, but we also do instapolls which gives us an opportunity to apply the knowledge we just learned for a participation grade.","I feel like the demos she does in class allow us to apply the concepts learned","Many questions on the homework are over topics that we have not yet learned. Because of this, prior knowledge must be applied to form conclusions about new topics.","We use models in class to demonstrate the concepts we talk about.","We observe visuals and class and learn how to decipher them.","Dr. [Removed] provides homeworks and in - class examples that relate to the concepts learned in class. However, the homework are usually ahead in content compared to her lectures.","I do not remember exact instance this occurred.","With all of our practice questions, Dr. [Removed] sometimes includes problems that seem very closely related to real - life applications of physics. With these types of problems, we are expected to use the data from the problem and apply it to the physics problems that we have been learning","This isn't necessarily exactly something that is gone over in class, but all equations and formulas are explained mathematically so we can understand them.","She gives us in world problems in our hw as well in class as practice problems","We always think about questions conceptually before mindlessly using formulas","We are doing physics problems where we must analyze mathematical models and concepts that we then learn to apply to other problems.","We use mathematical models / system in every class to set up our problem. We use a free body diagram to show the forces acting on our system.","During lecture, we would have squarecap questions that would test conceptual questions over the things we were currently learning. Sometimes, he would even have in class demonstrations that would actually help with visualizing certain topics too.","We are in a physics class, so every topic involved math models, which Dr. [Removed] explained well.","He asked us to understand different experiment models he conducted and to analyze all thr different factors along with giving as equations and having us understand and interpret what they meant.","This is just required in physics. Every class we look for patterns especially in the kinematic unit.","During the first / second week of class, we were going over the statistics of types of studying ( passive vs active )","Every class, we have discussion questions in which we analyze a model or question as a small group or alone and then we walk through it together.","We looked at different study methods and the science and effectiveness behind them.","We've talked about it in class.","I'm we were looking at data of students at [Removed]","The instructor would derive mathematical equations, such as equations relating work, power and other values. This was in class and projected on the board with full derivation and mathematical work.","We have looked at countless graphs and images in class. For example, during a lecture on electric potential, we were given a visual that showed us the movement of electrons go from high to low.","Very often posts short practices questions that make us analyze graphs, or charts and draw conceptual conclusions from it.","Yes, she had us analyze graphs and how they relate to physics","She gave us mathematical formulas and we'd apply them to the problem.","we did this because it's a physics class","1 meant to click \" can't recall \" oops \n","Today in class Dr. [Removed] had us interpret how the right hand rule applied to the cross product in the magnetic field equation.","When discussing the electric field created by different charged objects, the instructor showed graphs of the strength of the field relative to the distance from the object. Then, the instructor explained how to interpret the charts using the equations we learned in class.","All of the course material is based on mathematical models, which have their basis in experimental data.   Every lecture involves analyzing these models and assessing their accuracy.","N / A","We've done this as part of our readings for our weekly discussions.","We analyze scientific data and mathematical models through our weekly readings."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

We had just learned about periodic trends, and the instructor said, \" Based on what you know about periodic properties, I want you to predict how this unknown element might behave in a reaction. \" This activity pushed us to apply our knowledge of the periodic table to situations beyond what had been explicitly taught.","Before each class we have \" modules \" that cover the topics going to be discussed in class, and include more indepth information that we don't necessarily need to know, but allow for us to extend our knowledge and apply it in different ways than the class may require. This happens every day before class.","Our professor expects us to have a lot of experience from high school. She says \" you should have learned this in high school \", but not all of us did.","In our first unit when studying quantum mechanical models of atomic structure, there would be times in which we had learned the general rules of electron configurations and had to apply them to a new element not yet analyzed. Occasionally, there would also be exceptions that would be revealed through this process, which we would discuss after our individual analysis of the element.","She assigns learning modules before we gather for lecture so we can have a somewhat understanding when she's going over the topics in lecture. It's very helpful rather than just having no clue what she's talking about.","[Removed] asks us to finish the Learning Modules ( assignment ) before coming to class so that we have an idea of what we are going over in class. Furthermore, by looking at these modules, they help to build a foundation and will allow you to retain more information in class. \n","Typically we will having learning modules to do, before our lectures, on the topic(s ) we are going to learn. Where a question is asked and is not fully covered in the notes so we must apply our own knowledge to the question, but it is then later taught and covered by the instructor during the lecture.","Every class the professor makes us talk to the people around us and explain a problem or trend we have not yet covered but that we will soon get the answer to.","Usually towards the end of each lecture, the professor will give the class a preview of a topic covered in a future class and ask us if we can use our current knowledge to answer the question or figure out how to answer the question.","I believe we only briefly go over material not yet covered or soon to be covered. She some times just skips over that material entirely.","Occasionally, the topic we are learning about is taught more in - depth in later chemistry courses and the instructor would give us a brief introduction into that content. The instructor would inform us about the topic being content from later and then say here's an example and occasionally ask for us to try and solve for it.","There are mini sessions of \" active learning \" which happens regularly during each class. This is when Dr. [Removed] asks students questions such as how to order ionic compounds from smallest to largest in order of their lattice energy. This is a recent example of how students would need to recall what we've learned about ionization energy and ionic radii in unit 1 to order the ionic compounds by their charge first before their ionic radii.","The professor will sometimes rush information right before a quiz on it and expect you to pick it up immediately.","What happened in the course was that the professor asked about [Removed] structure of a water molecule which is something we had not covered. It happened this past week and words the instructor said was using past knowledge please draw the structure of a water molecule.","In the chemistry modules ( instructional material completed before the lecture ), the content will often connect to future chemistry units. For example, my learning module on bonding explained how some of the concepts connect to thermodynamics ( which will be taught in Unit 4 I think ).","[Removed] [","Before each class, our professor makes us do learning modules. These modules are about the content our professor will talk about in class so we already have some background information.","When we go over scientific formulas. We would talk about who founded the formula and the impact of the formula.","Use learning modules to apply newly learned concepts, and answer questions that you do not understand - that is why the quiz allows 3 attempts.","We were learning the different variables that are involved in [Removed], where we had to guess what each term is about based off their name. Then, we got to reflect and check with our fellow classmates.","There was a question on a quiz that the instructor did not have to time finish explaining the concept for.","Before we learned how to derive the calorimetry equations associated with closed and open systems, we were asked how to do the \" simple \" version on our own. We were given hints from the pictures / diagrams labeled with which system has the transfer of energy and which has an open transfer of mass and energy, definitions that we learned prior.","Before course started we had to know a little of what we had completed in high school. However, not everyone received the best education.","n / a","These are covered in learning modules and sometimes during lectures, the professor will explain how this may benefit us in upcoming units or in chemistry 302.","My professor mentions topics that aren't gone over in class within our lectures, and it confuses me on what material she is referring to because this is the only chemistry class I have ever taken, so I have no other knowledge besides what she is teaching and the material she provides us with.","It is more so that you have to apply knowledge that you should know as more of a prerequisite. Prior to taking the class you must take a chemistry readiness exam and if you pass you don't have to take the necessary modules. In those modules you cover different topics and ideas necessary for entering [Removed] 301 and without them, you might not understand what is happening when she applies those ideas. This happened more towards the beginning of the semester.","Her \" Learning Module \" assignments contain content like this. It contains material for the next lecture or beyond.","Dr. [Removed] has already challenged us to think back to some of our high school chemistry experience and apply it to new concepts in class and try and think through them in that manner. This has been interesting to see how different people in the class are thinking through new problems.","Sometimes she jumps ahead, and she covers things that have nothing to do with what we're going over. She'll expect us to know it even though we've never seen it before.","During active learning we go over questions and test our ability to apply our knowledge.","Our professor had us use unit one material in the following unit. This happened in the beginning of our new unit and she said the two would go hand in hand.","A week before the first test, we were going over applications and trends of the periodic table and we had to answer a problem of what we thought certain atoms we do based off old trends we were learning when discussing a new one.","Today's lecture consisted of a new subject and we ran out of time, and she emphasized how disturbed bond angles are going to play a big role on the next lecture. She said it was vital for us to comprehend at least what we were going to learn this upcoming Wednesday.","There have been very few times where this has occured, but there have been a few questions asked at the beginning of a class requiring you to know material not yet covered. Each of these times, we end up going over those topics by the end of class so that the material becomes clear.","The instructor will preview concepts that we will learn later in the class and apply them to what we are learning now. This just happened with hybridization when she mentioned it two or three classes before we actually learned it.","This is most occurent in every lecture where we cover material that many of us are either unfamiliar with or have not gone over in a long time. On top of that, the learning modules we complete before class are topics we have yet to cover, and we must complete them.","Professor [Removed] will often expand on ideas and concepts we learn in class, and connect them to [Removed] 302 ( the next [Removed] [Removed] course ). It is nice because we get a peek at what to expect in the following semester.","Dr. [Removed] will give us practice problems during lecture to see how much we truly know and then expands our knowledge afterwards.","Completing experiments.","This was only done in open class discussion in which she effectively tied together future content with what we were currently learning.","Dr. [Removed] often introduces concepts that will be expanded upon in future units so that we are not completely unfamiliar with them.","Whenever we did discussions in class, she would encourage us to use each other as resources.","In my chemistry class, the instructor often presented real - world scenarios during problem - solving sessions, requiring us to apply concepts beyond what was explicitly covered in lectures. For instance, after introducing equilibrium, they asked us to predict the outcome of chemical reactions in industrial processes, like ammonia synthesis, which hadn't been discussed yet. The instructor emphasized, \" Use the principles we've learned and think critically — don't worry about getting the' right' answer, focus on your reasoning. \"","you must know basics of chemistry from high school before going into this class. This is my second time to get in the class since I had no background knowledge whatsoever before I now understand a lot more because of this being my second time.","She gives us a chance to apply our knowledge to new topics, while giving us hints and walking us through it. Mostly at the beginning of a new unit where we cover similar but different topics.","We have active learning slides where we do practice problems \n","Dr. [Removed] told us to use our knowledge of algebra to isolate a variable. This was for the equation describing change in heat.","This has not happened frequently but sometimes we have had to use knowledge that was covered in the Learning Modules that we were supposed to learn before the class lecture.","While there are many examples of this, one specific and recent one I can think of is in the lecture notes.   As we are learning about the signs for exo- vs endo-/work being done on vs to, she put of several pictures of chemical reactions and asked us to interpret what we thought the signs of the reaction were.","[Removed] emphasizes topics to focus on that will be seen in harder chemistry classes such as ochem. \n","Over some topics, She will sometimes mention how we should have learned this in highschool.","Sometimes Dr. [Removed] will give small segments in the learning modules where we can see how what we are currently learning can be applied toward future units.","Before we had made it to unit 4, she introduced the functions that serve as the bases for thermo in unit 3 to create exposure and n the lest some familiarity to the topic.","I can't remember a specific moment","She would have active learning sections to solve questions although some of them for Unit 1 weren't so direct with what we were learning. Some of the off class knowledge was either done with previous HS knowledge or a deeper understanding of a topic we didn't really know about. It would make us think outside of the box.","What happened in the course is when we are lecturing she will go into topics on further units just to give us a peek of what we will soon be going into. This happens typically at the end of the week and end of the lecture.","Usually in class, professor [Removed] will absolutely go over future material over next class to get ahead because she wants to ensure we know all the material before the upcoming exam. This has been shown actually today because the unit we are currently going over requires a lot of memorization and she went over stuff we are going to go over next class regarding VSEPR structures since there's a lot.","Professor [Removed] often gives us \" sneak peeks \" into future topics or notes that certain concepts will be expanded upon in the future. She also often provides additional information which will important in [Removed] 2, [Removed] [Removed], etc.","My professor would explain various ideas extended based on a sole topic. Whether this was to other school topics or real world dealings.","We are currently learning [Removed] and today in lecture she briefly went over future material. I know this because i did the Module for next lecture and it was extremely easy because we went over most of it during lecture.","When learning about trends such as [Removed], Electronegativity, ionization energy we would be asked to rank certain elements. The trick was to also remember what we had learned about half - filled and filled shells and apply that and consider how it would change the trend in certain spots. This was a helpful exercise.","We sometimes look into topics that will not happen in until the next chapter to begin a foundation. Like toady, Professor may say something like \" this is for unit four but as a basis for now.. \"","I think an instance where this happened was when discussing different types of orbitals but it was implied we already knew what an orbital was but I did not.","Especially when considering mathematical formulae we have used, Dr. [Removed] encourages us to find mathematical relations between two or more variables which helps cement our understanding of something she may not have taught us directly.","We have been asked questions over things we were not taught yet but were expected to know through learning modules done before each class","Every lecture we have touched briefly on topics that will come up in a later lecture. Like [Removed] structures, and necessity to remember polyatomic ions.","At the beginning of unit 2, our instructor told us to memorize certain concepts, such as polyatomic ions. This would allow us to better succeed in the future of the course and build intuition.","Sometimes we skip ahead in the course and that requires us to use knowledge we have not learned. She says it is a peak into the next unit. I am not sure I find it very helpful ; I wish we could go over the topic we just learned more.","We were learning about bond theories and Dr. [Removed] mentioned how the material will be useful to thermodynamics and electrochem later on. This acted as a foresight into the future of the course.","Usually, the topics we go over in class coincide with topics we have not covered as a class.","By this, I mean that we are expected to have a base level knowledge of chemistry from high school or previous chem classes and I do not have that base level knowledge so even the easiest and most \" obvious \" concepts for some students is hard for me and needs to be broken down very clearly.","Learning modules cover topics before the class period, so this has happened 13 times. I would prefer doing the learning module after the class.","We were learning about electrons shells and she asked us in a quiz about what that molecule would look like in 3D and with what shape. \n","This occurs during the online learning modules whenever she will remind us that certain equations or topics will be presentated in the next unit so we must kind of get an idea of what it is now versus later. This happened just in the latest learning module I just did. She told us this online and during a lecture.","She relates things to natural phenomenons and explains why the topic we are covering in the moment will be relevant in the future.","We have learning modules each week before the lecture that require us to apply our knowledge, study skills, and resources to learn the material before it is taught.","Some homework assignments during this course have included information not yet covered in class.","The thundercloud and pumpkin explosion demos were really helpful and engaging in relating the chemistry concepts to everyday life experiences.","Brief conceptual topics","Dr. [Removed] frequently relates current topics to [Removed] material and material covered later in the semester. She cross - applies well.","She let us know that we would have to acquire some knowledge beforehand. Including the pre - assessment that we had to take.","Normally while going through the lecture slides, Dr. [Removed] will say something along the lines of \" we don't need this now but it's good to start thinking about this for next unit / [Removed] 302. \" This normally happens every to every other lecture.","Through our classes learning modules, my teacher would introduce material we have not yet learned in order to chllamnge our understanding and ensure we are exposed to the content prior to her lecturing about it. it helps us gain fresh eyes and pre - understanding.","Have us answer instapolls. Have us collaborate with each other","n / a","During lectures, we have been asked questions about topics either we are about to learn or just learned. This requires students to apply knowledge to these new topics.","relate to real world issues in class","Before performing certain lab techniques for the actual experiments, we had lab sessions where we just jumped into applying these techniques. For example, for me, I never learned how to work with petri dishes before this lab, such as simple tasks including spreading a sample on the petri dish or parafilming the petri dish. I just did the tasks given and it helped me learn.","This never happened, I misclicked \n","She urged us to research the concepts in class on our own time as well in order to understand the concept well","Several times we were encouraged to use information we knew from [Removed].","She would talk about what we would do in upcoming labs to encourage us and make us look forward to it.","The instructor requries students to extend or apply knowledge to situations not yet covered in the course by doing pre labs outside of lab to have a deeper understanding of the hand on experiements. In addition, we also apply knowledge such as not procrastinating to ensure we get everything turned in on time.","Every week we are given a prelab that we need to complete, which the readings and resources we use for the prelab sometimes go far beyond the scope of this course. I think it sometimes is helpful but also difficult and time consuming to learn something that thorough on our own for an assignment that doesn't use all of that information.","When the topic of ethics was first introduced, we had to discuss how ethics can be applied to businesses and healthcare practices. I don't remember words that were said, but because we hadn't discussed ethics yet, it wasn't covered in the course.","The instructor described procedures that we would be doing in the future with the bacteria and asked us to consider how the set up of our original plates and dilutions were important for accurate results.","explains how what we are doing in the lab is relevant to scope beyond class","we apply our knowledge that we learned in class to our weekly reports.","I was asked to think about what would be beneficial to subculturing. This happened around September 16th.","We are encouraged to apply our newly gained knowledge to future questions and experiments involving our bacteria samples.","[Removed] and quizzes.","Each week, professors assigned a pre - lab that contained information for the upcoming labs. We would complete this assignment with some background information, but it took place before actual lab application.","N / A","During lab, my TA and LA would ask us questions while we were doing the experiment and would ask us to expand on what we knew.","We have weekly [Removed] assignments that explore bioethics and weekly research reports that pose some hypotheticals for us to consider for our end of year research poster.","We have a project due in which the material we are learning is not covered in the course. I enjoyed doing the project because I learned essential skills that I would otherwise not learn. \n","Both in our weekly homework assignments and weekly discussions, slight deviations from our covered topics are taken. They both test our ability to use concepts we learned in class to tackle concepts that seem more difficult than anything we have covered in class.","Last week, Dr. [Removed], upon introducing epistasis, did not give up the exact ratios of offspring phenotypes. Instead, she expected up to work it out from the information in the problem and out prior knowledge ; and we did!","Dr. [Removed] often allows us to think about the real - world implications of important concepts we are learning.","Dr. [Removed] ever so kindly educates us about [Removed] diseases that impact people and discusses the mechanisms behind such diseases ; then, she teaches us about the details of why such dysfunction occurs and really encourages us to think about possible solutions to the problem. It really motivates me to tackle science by the tail and help find solutions to such diseases … for the better of humanity!","When learning about different alleles like recessive and dominant traits, we applied this to things like dominant and recessive x - linked traits for colorblindness","Yes, she does this quite often by asking us hypothetical questions during lectures to apply our class knowledge to topics we are unfamiliar about. This helps us test ourselves individually about whether we truly grasped the topic in the lecture.","On our homework assignments, there were many times during which the questions utilized concepts from the lecture but in a circumstance previously not seen. This made it so that our knowledge was expanded, applied to different circumstances which were previously unfamiliar.","yes we have \n","Project 2 in the course required us to research new diseases or disorders that can be caused by the genes we learn about in class. This is a completely new application of gene and protein expression that students haven't explored before.","We use real world examples often. She is very good at applying our knowledge to relevant world events.","Dr. [Removed] teachers us how the material can be applied to real life events. Because we are learning genetics she incorporates various conditions as examples in our lectures. She does this very frequently likely every class.","Just recently, we completed a lab where we analyzed the differences in categorical vs quantitative data and the implications it can have in the science world. Overall, this was helpful in refreshing the concepts I learned in biostats last semester.","She lets us know of concepts that will be covered during class. She sometimes tries to apply concepts we will learn next time to what we are currently doing.","During class and discussion, we would be given problems where we would have to apply the knowledge being taught to us in the scenarios. The instructors would walk around and help guide us in the right direction if we were lost.","The professor would call on topics we learned in [Removed] to teach a new concept in genetics like probabiities of a dihybrid cross, and then take it further.","She has Lab assignments that require some statistical analysis ( guided ), we have three such assignments during the course of the class.","In our homework there is a reflection question that students can choose to do for points which involves applying knowledge learned in the course to real life concepts.","Dr. [Removed] gives us foundational knowledge from the genetics course and asks us to apply the knowledge to something else in our homework assignments.","Genetics is all about the real world and how living organisms come to be around us. It applies to everything, and I think she makes that clear in her lectures!","Directed us how these topics apply to our daily lives \n","In our lab assignments, we often will apply the concepts we have learned to more \" real - life \" situations which helps lead us to learn topics not yet covered.","usually just knowledge from previous science class that could be applied to [Removed]","In this course, the instructor frequently incorporated assignments that asked students to apply course concepts to unfamiliar situations. For example, midway through the semester, we were tasked with analyzing a real - world case study that hadn't been covered in class, using theories we'd learned to propose solutions. The instructor explained, “ This assignment is designed to stretch your understanding and see how these concepts work outside of examples we've already discussed. ” This approach encouraged deeper learning and helped us connect theory to practice in meaningful ways.","He has us use outside knowledge to apply to practice problems but guides us through it \n","Instructor will reference topics that we will cover in future in current material during lecture.","As I mentioned before, readings for this class is often dependent on the student, as the readings could cover comprehension or unanswered questions. As of last class, Friday the 27th, the professor   reminded us of the readings and its significance.","Before moving onto a new topic Dr [Removed] will show us a real world example of the up and coming information ( usually something about space or the moon ) and then he'll ask us questions. I think this is done so that we can think critically about what we already know and try to apply that and logic to delve into the next topic.","On the homework there will be questions that we have equations for but haven't yet done in class. This homework is weekly and encourages us to apply skills we cover in class to more complex problems.","There are homework questions that aren't solvable using lecture or textbook material. Homework assignments are due every week.","When doing the hw, this is   a requirement. But may also be a fact that I can't remember","I don't think [Removed] excepts you to know material that we have not already covered, we just build on past material.","I would say this is more in parts of the quest homework, where some questions may be some we've never seen before and or extends slightly beyond what I believe we are to know. I think may have happened in the last few homework assignments, where I try my best to figure it out and then search online to see a completely random method I've never seen, but in class he does tend to go over those types of question to help us.","Before every topic, Dr. [Removed] presents us with real world situations like a spinning top to think about how it works first.","Before the first midterm, we did simple one - dimensional kinetic problems. However, on the midterm, we were asked to solve a one - dimensional kinetic problem with an additional step ( last question ). I did not know how to incorporate this step because we never took the extra step during class.","  He asks us to think about certain topics in real world examples before we start covering it.","The instructor makes sure that when they provide examples that they fully explain each step. Let's say for example they are talking about forces, they will ask and apply what they know about walking and which forces act upon the person when walking, like in this instance gravity.","This happened once in an exam and my professor was able to discard the question since it required knowledge we did not learn.","The instructor often mentions things having to do with space and space activities. Sometimes it's understandable, sometimes it's not.","Topics on the homework are not always covered before it is due.","On the homework, I often feel that the concepts and knowledge necessary to solve the problems has not been covered in class. In class examples are often very basic while the homework tends to be much more advanced and I often feel I don't have the necessary skills to do it.","introduces topics to discuss before we go over it through demos and instapolls","dr.perera tries to get us to apply what we learned to problems we've never seen before","In our squarecap lessons, the instructor allows us to read application problems that may include information from future chapters we haven't fully covered. This allows us to get a preview and think deeply about how topics connect. \n","During square cap and lectures, he sometimes gives us time to think and answer to ourselves. We also have square cap which we can apply knowledge.","he wouldn't require us to know specific things but it's recommended that we learn how to apply the material for later uses for the exam","he has daily grades that ask about some things he didn't cover","He does this through his squarecaps that we do everyday. There is often a passage of something relating to real life circumstances where we have to apply the content we learned to the circumstance.","He encourages students to look further into chapters. If students do or don't he will bring it up in certain context to help students understand material.","On [Removed]. we had to answer questions where we applied what we knew about microscopes to real world situations. We had to provide a way to test for contaminants in a water source based on what we knew about the different types of microscopes.","He tells us to read the textbook before we go over it in lecture so we can just comm next ideas in class","Usually in the beginning of the unit he will add a question on the [Removed] that we haven't learned yet like a foreshadowing teaching moment.","we have to apply the concepts to real life questions","We have square caps at the end of every lecture that quizzes us on the information and most questions include real life application questions on material not covered in the class such as looking at the sequencing of a cell communication pathway of a certain hormone which we did last class, but this question is completely answerable if we know the information. Dr. [Removed] is consistently making us apply knowledge.","In class he encourages us to go in depth about a particular topic","Every lecture has a set of in class questions which are divided into three sections, and one of the sections is named' application.' Typically through squarecap he asks at least 2 application questions per lecture. One example I can clearly remember was my last lecture when he had asked' why do we eat' and one of the previous lectures he had asked' when you straighten you hair, what bonds are you breaking?' as well as' what would happen if we were to drink too much water and why.'","During exams, some questions would include topics that were adjacent to the concepts that were being fully discussed in class. Although we did not learn about some of these topics, Professor [Removed] reassured us that applying concepts form class to this new topic would allow us to determine the correct answer.","On one of our square caps last week, we were given a question that required more knowledge than what was explained in the lecture. We had to ask a TA for help and were told to try our best with the knowledge we knew, and attempt to apply that to the question even though we didn't understand all the information.","Describing how ribosomes are made and make proteins we discussed a bit of protein synthesis and had to apply our knowledge of amino acids to understand what it is.","Squarecap","For this course, you pretty much already have to have a base of knowledge in biology to succeed. On our discussion section worksheets, we often see and talk about things we have not learned yet in our lectures.","I was mainly thinking about the homework where we covered every topic we needed, but the exact applications are a little different and require some extension / thinking!","Using R to find the latitude / longitude","There has not been any moments I remember where she has required us to apply knowledge to topics we have not learned yet.","Our project","She challenges us sometimes with harder codes, in lab","Sometimes includes concepts not fully covered on homeworks in order to teach them for future reference. The concepts are always explained in a way that can be understood without class time.","our lab assignments build off stuff we have covered previously and requires application of learning","she likes us to think critical and its helpful usually each class period","The weekly lab assignments require us to use the code and lessons that we have learned throughout the week and apply it to a new dataset and answer questions.","she s fine, really hard working","i don't remember","The professor does a great job with giving us in class and outside of class practice.","Every class we're asked questions that pertain to this","We have been working on our project for this class for the past month and a half. We were required to tidy the dataset and work with the data from the [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] [Removed], and because this was real data that wasn't necessarily cleaned up and set up for direct manipulation by students, there was potential for encountering data manipulation techniques we hadn't quite covered.","er projects of working with the city pushed the students to step outside the box and achieve success.","When analyzing data given and trying to make sense of it, the professor at times would ask us to interpret the data given to us.","very imporant","This is most applicable in the homework. Some of them really requires us to think hard about it.","Earlier this month, Dr. [Removed] asked us to think about how we would get the best chances of winning a gameshow through the probability rules we learned in the previous class.","During lecture for this course, my instructor asked us to apply guidelines for our project to hypothetical project scenarios. This was also part of our lab activity.","This experience happened when the instructor asked us to apply what we learned to a topic that interests us for our future project.","We had a sample question of probability that 2 people had the same birthday and it was a lot more complex than it seemed","I can not remember a specific moment, but I like that professor [Removed] uses example that are applicable to the real world.","Well things just make more sense the further you go on. So you have these questions with the assignments then next lecture you understand.","A couple of weeks ago, the professor brought up the idea of [Removed] testing. What was unique about this from of testing was that it applied to future course material we had not learned yet. So, we can draw on past knowledge when we get to that point.","This is more general as the instructor would preview questions that would be seen later.","I learned about ecology took notes and studied for tests. In class handoutd help me","With [Removed] note 2, excel was used and specifically pivot tables. [Removed] tables were not directly taught, but resources were provided to learn about them.","Ecology Notes","She did this during an instapoll during one class session. This was earlier on in the course, probably during the second week. It had to do with evolution I believe.","She gives us assignments to learn to how use excel.","She has not done this.","She'll ask a question about a future topic by alluding to what we can apply to it with prior information","I don't think that has happened in the course","Our daily quizzes are not usually topics we have learnt, she s uses them as a way to introduce the new topic","She briefly brought up torque while reviewing another topic before we had actually went over torque.","Talked about topics a little ahead and we had to figure out with the people next to us, for quiz questions. This was really helpful and we also had demos to see if we were right or not. She said that it's okay if we were wrong.","Some of our test questions have never been gone over before.","Reading the textbook.","In our discussion we sometimes talk about things we haven't done in class yet. This is to get us thinking about what we will learn on Thursdays.","The homework assignments are often more complex than what is covered in class and requires advanced application of the basic things we cover in lecture.","The professor assures we are engaging with the topics of the class by asking instapolls and allowing for everyone to discuss why an answer may be right or wrong and what is the best answer choice. The professor assures to do this every class day.","On quest homeworks, there are usually different problems to the ones discussed in class, which foster applying concepts in different situations","In discussion section we are required to work with others to think through problems that aren't similar to anything we've seen before. This has happened multiple times","Will ask questions on instapoll, and sometimes questions on tests that require thinking outside the box. Nothing too crazy though.","It's part of the course, it is always needed.","It's usually based on [Removed] in class where we apply what we have learned. One example that comes to mind is based on the formulas what direct would a particle travel in an induced magnetic field. And he brings out a demo and asks us to consider what type of particle it may be","This part I am not fully ceratin I understood the   [Removed]. However, my professor does allow us to watch off topic videos to expand our understanding which is done in the prelecture.","Before each lecture, we are expected to complete a prelecture module on canvas that provides an introduction to the topics later discussed in class. In this module we are expected to share any thoughts, questions, or connections to the topics which are usually things we have not learned yet. In class, we go on to discuss them in greater detail, and we are expected to reiterate what we thought about the topic.","I don't recall a specific instance of this.","He would present us with questions, and we were expected to identify and respond to them based on our knowledge. Subsequently, he would elaborate on the answers and highlight additional factors to consider.","This primarily occurs during our discussion sections where a couple of questions are posed to the students of which we must answer in a given time frame. These questions require a different set of logical skills and thinking that are not normally tackled in the textbook. Additionally, there is a wide array of feedback from the TAs in order to steer us in the right direction.","Usually in homework","When we are diving into kinematics he would make us apply [Removed], something we haven't covered at all, into doing or work. He also explained to us how the kinematic equations are derived using calculus.","I remember looking a question in the test I have never seen before.","In class we tend to do handouts in which we answer multiple different questions. These questions include things we have sometimes not covered yet. This challenges us to use what we know to answer these specific questions.","i m not sure but i don't remember talking about topics that we haven't covered","She gives us examples and asks us to think about other applications.","Dr. [Removed]'s lecture style is often a little off sequence with when our practice and homework assignments are due. This creates an inherent need to use and reflect on topics that we have yet to cover in class. This has occurred all throughout the semester. Dr. [Removed] doesn't often acknowledge it verbally, but seems to understand the sequential method she uses for lecture and assignments.","The professor normally goes over the basics in class, and we apply these to problems that are much more complex in homework.","While doing the [Removed] homework every week, some questions sometimes cover concepts we don't go over in class.","Pretty much any of the squarecap questions he's given. They usually are expansions of the lecture that he hasn't necessarily described how to do yet.","He would make connections to units we have not covered yet so that we could see a clear connection between areas of physics that may overlap. He had us think about kinetic friction ad how at a certain point it will overcome static friction to get an object to move","N / A accidentally misclicked","In the first week of class, our homework assignment involved kinematic problems that we had not yet covered in class. This required me to self - learn vectors and other such topics.","When in class, we occasionally will reflect on real life examples and demonstrations which have not been introduced or are in the process of being introduced by the professor. This allows us to take our current knowledge of the subject and expand it on new material and ideas \n","The instructor gives good background information enough to be applied to things not covered yet.","During lectures, we are often presented with topics that aren't entirely familiar and are asked to extend upon what we think the topic is and our ideas or thoughts about how the material may relate to us or be helpful in our scenarios. In one of our lectures, we came across degree options and understanding [Removed] vs [Removed]. We were asked if we knew the difference between the two or of any information related to either and were tasked with discussing the topics using our application of previous knowledge.","We are shown how somethings we do will be useful later on in our schooling or career.","Sometimes homework question go beyond the scope of our notes or he'll mention applications of this material in research and things","Puts challenging questions on the homework for us to complete.","Professor combines topics that interact in a new way. She offers the ideas and waits for us to answer with our own thoughts, leading us toward the correct answer.","There were some topics that I didn't know before this class especially units of measurements.","She has expressed that physics is everywhere and uses [Removed] to apply to it to daily life.","[Removed] wants us to think beyond what we are directly learning in the lecture and uses our future teachings to get us thinking about solving real - world problems. Applying knowledge to world problems and painting the picture before solving it is something we do every day in lectures.","We apply our knowledge to different real world scenarios and it is helpful for us to grasp concepts","We are given short modules with questions covering information we will learn in the next lecture. These are accompanied by explanatory videos and give us an idea of what we are going to learn next."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

The instapoll questions usually pertain to the material and are typically simple questions or applied questions which help better attain the knowledge. Dr. [Removed] used words such as talk with your partner or take a moment to answer these questions or apply this formula to this question","When in class and the teacher has us draw a [Removed] structure of a molecule and reveals after there are muiltple ways to draw it and then why one way is going to be the most favorable in future topics","[Removed] instapolls in class and also asks them while lecturing","She asks students to write the correct lewis structure of a molecule. This took place last week in class","We discussed with our peers the problems on the screen, usually every class. She'll say turn and talk with your partner and discuss your answer.","my instructor uses instapoll to help us engage with course content and challenge our understanding","She would have problems on the slides that are exercise problems. Then she would have us discuss with the ones around us how to solve the problem and why. It usually happens 3 - 4 times per class. Afterwards, she would go over the answers and make sure we understood it.","She has us doing instantpolls every once in awhile","I don't remember specific moment","Sometimes my instructor asks questions to the whole lecture and asks us to discuss with our fellow classmates. She asks multiple questions, making multiple correct answers possible.","During our instapolls we were tasked with writing our thoughts about the current topic in class and to give our opnions. This happened about a week ago in class.","Professor asks students to talk among esch other. Pretty much every class, we do this. It's helpful to get help from peers.","We learned about a new concept in class then the teacher asked us to talk to our neighbors about what we thought a problem on the new concept was like.","what : instapolls are conducted during lecture and are sometimes open - ended and sometimes are multiple choice. \n\n when : once a week","Dr. [Removed] asks us questions during our lectures which then makes us talk about it with our peers, and later explains how we get to the answer. She additionally does instapolls to keep us engaged.","Multiple times during each lecture, she will stop the class on questions and have us talk with our neighbors about the answers. Some of the questions have multiple ways to approach them, thus different answers","I don't fully remember the context, but I believe we were discussing the properties of certain functions, and recognized that there were multiple correct ways to phrase the answer.","There are practice questions scattered throughout the lectures that help me learn the material","Questions on the lecture slides where she tells us to talk about possible answers for questions","Ask students to do intsapoll. Relates the topics to real life.","During the lecture discussions, there are often multiple options that might fit into one category, so the professor is trying to guage how well you can differentiate between different categories. These also become test questions often.","There was this once experience where in one of the quizzes, a question had several answers. Giving us a greater chance to succeed","We get opportunities to talk about it out loud with someone next to us which really tests if I understand what we are going over. I like to teach others and help others around me so I find it helpful for my understanding.","We do many exercises in class each week where we can talk about the answers and there multiple possibilties of correct answers","Our practice problems have multiple ways to solve and answers","The instructor often gives out instapolls during class, which helps us test our knowledge of the topic. We can discuss with our pers and put the content we just learned into use.","Dr. [Removed] would just have us do installs as a knowledge check. This happened last Monday, I believe.","We sometimes have open discussions about topics before we learn about them in depth.","After we've covered a topic usually once a class we will answer an instapoll questions or questions in class.","On a quiz we recently took, there were two correct answers. She let us know beforehand","Daily she gives us time to alanyze graphs and try and get what it is saying then she will tell us which is really helpful.","Just today she asked about what orbitals bonding would occur. Without prior knowledge, there were multiple correct answers to the topic, but she homed in on what actually happens after we discussed all together.","She would ask us about a certain concept and to talk to our peers to see what we thought about it. She would then bring the class back together and discuss it.","In class, Dr [Removed] uses [Removed] [Removed] to keep us engaged with the material in lecture that day. On September 9th, Dr [Removed] asked us \" Which objects will have a larger de [Removed] wavelength? Make a connection based on relative mass. \" Before this, we had made the generally introduced the [Removed] formula and Dr [Removed] used the [Removed] to allow us to apply this concept to any object we could think of.","Just discussing hypotheticals in reactions^","She will give us a few minutes to discuss the questions and practice on our end, then go over the answers in class","The professor constantly gives us time to discuss topics between ourselves to come up with possible answers. When the time is up she gives the main correct answer, but also sometimes gives alternative answers a student could've come up with.","My instructor lets us think about questions that might have 2 different solutions in the course material. She gives us time to think through it and answer in our own way.","During our lecture about quantum numbers, professor [Removed] asked us to consider all possible quantum numbers for a set of atoms.","ut insta - poll","The reason for this was [Removed] [Removed] would almost always get people to raise their hands and even without raising to speak up and join any discussion we had. This would make us feel like our answers are always good.","We have instapoles each week","We have practice problems in class where everyone's answers are close but not exactly the same","The course has quizzes once a week that are taken every Wednesday at the end of class. Sometimes we only have one class to learn the material that will be covered in the quiz. Occasionally when taking the quizzes students feel unprepared and don't know what will be covered.","Dr. [Removed] embeds active learning questions within the learning materials in lecture. Many of these are to get students thinking about why the things we are taught are the way they are in an effort to have a more comprehensive understanding of the material. The teacher will ask a question directed that way and give us time to discuss with peers all the things that may contribute to how something works in chemistry.","Opened an Instapoll during the middle of class and ask to answer the question show we in the instapoll","During lectures, we talk about the multiple options for each question. In the study guides, there are questions that have multiple answers and we have to discern which are correct.","The teacher would stop during lecture to get us to discuss the topics. This happened today to help us get down lewis structures.","In Dr. [Removed]'s chemistry course, she introduced various interactive online resources to enhance our understanding of molecular structures. Specifically, she recommended using a free online simulation from [Removed] [Removed] for visualizing molecule shapes in 3D, which was linked in her lecture notes.","When learning about a new concept, she may provide us sets of questions where there are can be multiple correct answers depending on the angle that you approach it with, and whether or not any number of exceptions apply.","Some questions on the slides during lecture had multiple possible answers.","Dr. [Removed] normally gives us an open - ended problem then has us talk it out so we understand the concept better once we figure it out.","All of the practice exams and review notes had open - ended questions that were helpful in learning and exam practice.","In every class, our class notes will always have premade questions meant for the students to engage in and talk to students around us. This helps me better understand the material when I am lost.","Our instructor often hosts [Removed] in which students are incentivized to participate. Many of these polls are open ended and are mostly to get your brain thinking.","We often do questions together during class and our instructor also gives us time to discuss the questions amongst ourselves and with others.   It is nice to do this ask others around us because it is hard to talk to the professor personally.","There is time in between taught concepts to do practice problems that can be discussed with classmates.","During classroom time Dr. [Removed] has instapoll questions which ask questions on course material. Sometimes these questions are open ended instead of multiple choice. Sometimes there are multiple correct answers for multiple choice on top of open ended as well. The instructor then explains the solution and work after the poll has ended.","Caudill will give us multiple instapolls per class. These have questions that range from recall, to calculating, to personal questions such as confidence levels. \n","There are very few, however she does maintain parcopatipatoon. She will let us know that the question is open ended too.","The instructor gave us [Removed] instapoll questions regarding the topic that was covered in the lecture. These instapoll questions were sometimes open - ended, allowing students to write out their thoughts and responses.","The insta polls","We have short polls in class where we have to try and select the correct answer. Sometimes, there will be more than one correct answer where if you pick either one, you will get it right.","During the middle of lectures, Dr. [Removed] will give us questions from the lecture slides and have us do them in groups to allow each other to help us better understand the topic. She gives us a couple minutes for this and then we always go over it as a class.","The professor asked us to balance equations, and then calculate the volume needed for the specific reaction based upon the [Removed] Gas [Removed] at [Removed]. This happened a couple weeks ago, and the professor explained why the answer what it was after we had all finished the question.","Instapolls with multiple correct answers","While I am not completely certain, I am quite certain that numerous instapoll questions Dr. [Removed] would provide had either multiple correct answers or free response answers.","Our instructor often has questions that she has us answer during lectures that we can also discuss with classmates to figure out the answers.","In this course, the professor posts polls during class that can have multiple answers. We are encouraged to collaborate with our peers to determine which choices are possible answers and we are given time to discuss our reasoning. The professor emphasizes the importance of collaboration during these exercises.","My instructor walks through problems sometimes with the class. We do it on our own while she completes in on the projection.","During class lectures \n","An example would be she would tell us to practice writing [Removed] dot structures. This happened on Monday September 30th. I can't remember specifically what she had said but she got the point across.","Every day we would have open - ended questions and are encouraged to engage in group discussions about them.","Dr. [Removed] asks multiple times every lecture to discuss questions with someone next to us. She asks us to discuss possible outcomes / results of certain molecular reactions.","I don't remember a question where multiple choices were correct.","She has quizzes so if you fail I suppose you know to study before the test. Sometimes asks questions and says \" both answers are correct \".","N / A","My professor asked us to type which question type we were still uncertain of.","My Professor would put questions on the board for us to answer whether that be an open - ended question or multiple choice question. She gave us time to work on it, and talk to our peers about what the possible answer could be.","She will ask us to discuss the reasons behind exergonic and endergonic processes and she will ask us to talk about examples in real life.","Dr. [Removed] has asked us questions in class, either instapolls or just in general questions, about concepts with multiple different correct answers. She will do this during class and give us time to talk with our neighbors about what the correct answers could be and why. After that she will usually try to get an answer out of the crowd and then work through the question herself while we watch. This happens frequently during class, I can not recall if it is every single class but it is in a good majority of them.","It was good","A lot of times there is only one correct answer in [Removed] 301, but there have been a few times where multiple answers were accepted.","In class we are able to answer open ended question and discuss them with the people next to us then Dr. [Removed] will go ever them.","We go over open ended questtions in class.","On Wednesday our instructor asked us our opinion on how comfortable are we in doing calculations in unit 4","There has been multiple times during the class when Dr. [Removed] gives us the opportunity to turn to one another and we ask each other questions. As students, we all have so many questions and answers that   are correct.","It happens every class. The instructor said \" turn to your neighbor and discuss... \"","This happens during instapolls to check our attendance and understanding. This is a great thing we do to make sure for yourself that you understand.","Caudill always asks us to collaborate on questions so that we better understand the material.","I absolutely love this course.","Discussion questions during class.","In this lab course we've only had 1 quiz, but we do many pre - labs that require us to think about the application of these skills and how we can use the topics we're demonstrating in real life.","We occasionally have open - ended question quizzes throughout the course. With each quiz comes a set of questions to study, however, the correct answer may vary in different ways from student to student, so they apply the most liberal answer so that everyone can get credit for it.","The professor assigns [Removed] assignments where we watch a video or read an article related to ethics in science. We are required to provide 3 high quality comments discussing the ethics behind the given situation.","[Removed] told us to rate past posters for our biology lab. This was during the 2nd week of lab.","We not only have multiple quizzes that are open ended format but we are also to complete a lab report once a week on what we learned and how it is relevant to the work we are completing in lab.","Either in the form of asking our opinions on posters, or what the soil samples could look like, or how we would go about collecting data. Additionally pre - labs are sometimes open - ended and can have a variety of responses.","She would ask us several questions and we would have a range of answers to choose from. If one of us got it wrong, she would help us by correcting it and telling us why.","We have three quizzes throughout the semester, each with open - ended questions that allow us to expand on articles, protocols, and websites we've read.","Perusall assignments","I was thinking of the quizzes but there actually isn't multiple choices on these.","Our lab TA makes our groups work together to answer sets of questions. She then will call on a table and we will respond. The entire discussion is very open and is mostly to make us think about the topic we are learning.","They provide an examples on a power point before encouraging us to replicate the exercise or technique needed. The TA and teacher are really helpful in this way.","The TA allowed us to have a class discussion about which posters we thought were the most presentable. There were multiple right answers as long as you explained your reasoning.","N / A","I don't think we have had an question where there were multiple answers to a given question yet. Usually in STEM you don't see much questions like that.","Seemed like Busy work nit sure If i learned a ton","This class is built upon doing experiments and tasks that you may not be entirely familiar with so it's important to draw upon information from other aspects of your life. I believe it's important to have good communication skills to ask questions and advocate for yourself in the course because some tasks may not seem as intuitive as others.","We have weekly lab reports that need our lab and outside knowledge to interpret what we have done that week. They are open - ended and are dependent on your lab group.","We used [Removed] [Removed] to search for antibiotics.","Ask things about the lab and during the lab. They encourage participation. They say it will help us.","We would be assigned articles and videos to watch and have open discussions online. This media would pertain to scientific discoveries, ethical dilemmas, and scientific articles, which would then have discussion points for comment.","I don't remember anytime this happened. Maybe we have done this when discussing assignments.","During one lab session, the instructor asked us to design our own methods for testing the antibiotic properties of different bacterial isolates. There was no single correct approach, and the instructor encouraged creativity by saying, “ There are multiple ways to approach this ; choose methods that make sense to you based on what you've learned. ” This open - ended exercise allowed us to apply our knowledge in diverse ways and led to rich discussions about the advantages and limitations of each approach.","I interpreted our experiments as the exercises. Multiple correct answers are possible because everyone has different soil and bacteria.","We have quizzes and pre lab assignments that require written responses. Not every student is able to write the same thing, therefore multiple different answers are acceptable.","In the quizzes or prelabs, there are questions that are open - ended. It means that there are many correct answers and she wants us to know that there isn't always one answer to just a question.","We have to do [Removed] assignments every week that ask us to analyze [Removed] and write comments about them","We have assessments that include discussions over an article or video relevant to what we are doing and throughout the assignment we can discuss our different perspectives and concerns about the idea.","In the beginning of class, [Removed] will usually stand at the front and run us through that days procedures and expectations. Most times, she asks questions about the reasoning behind certain lab procedures in which we are expected to raise our hands and answer. It is short but beneficial.","Every class, we are asked about the techniques and ideas covered in the procedure and how we can execute them properly","Always happens at the beginning of class","She often starts the lab with questions that help exercise our memory of the material we need to know and understand for the experiments. In this way, she asks us to participate in open - ended exercises in which multiple correct answers are possible, because she always helps and leads us to the right answers in the end","The instructor assigns research reports every week that ask us open - ended questions about the topics covered in that week's labs. There are multiple correct answers possible because many of the questions have to do with our own results throughout the week","This is a lab course in which experiments can output various answers and not one definitive answer due to possibilities of error and different samples.","Our lab reports are open ended and reflect out overall understanding and learning.","Sometimes in class when we do [Removed] [Removed] questions, there are multiple correct answers.","Dr. [Removed] asked us to do a project assignment   in which questions were open - ended and were varying depending on each student and their interpretation   of each question. Here we collected data and on a Wednesday class session, spoke with our peers regarding our answers as to what graphs we used for the project and our interpretations on both continuous traits and discrete traits and whether the results were applicable to consistent with the general population. This action promoted collaboration while encouraging us students to analyze our data and our interpretations on the data.","In our course, the instructor had us explore different allele combinations for a gene, emphasizing that there could be multiple correct answers. During the genetics module, the instructor would say, \" Consider all possible allele pairings — there's not just one solution, \" encouraging open - ended exploration and discussion.","Every morning we start with an icebreaker where we will talk about different topics. Sometimes it's related to genetics and sometimes it's just about getting to know our table mates better. It is low - stress and often allows us to ease ourselves into the class. \n","We were asked in a project what treatment options could be for a certain disease. It gave opportunity to apply knowledge to something that seemed bigger and to think of creative responses.","We have daily instapolls in class. Some questions are open - ended, single - answer choice correct, or multiple answers choices are correct.","We have many insta polls during class that keeps everyone engaged and answering questions, some are open ended and some are multiple choice","Dr. [Removed] passed out whiteboard markers and asked us to work with our tablemates to draw how phospholipids would orient themselves within two different environment. Then we walked around and looked at all the different groups' drawings.","There are textbook questions that we do for homework that reflect this.","We recently completed a project in which we had to conduct research over a chosen disease or protein mutation and answer questions over it. All of the answers changed depending on the protein the student had chosen.","In instapolls we asnwer questions related to the topic and many times multiple answers can be correct","In class questions for each team in discussion question and help them answer the question and put them on the right path.","We do this every class period in both discussion sections and lectures by using insta polls. The instructors also ask follow up questions that encourage us to think more critically.","She often asks the class questions that have multiple answers so different groups can give their answers","There was a survey - type question at the end of the homework.","Instapoll questions in class","We do exercises, such as our labs that have opened it answers with multiple correct solutions","We were given an assignment during class to talk about mitosis and meiosis while using pipe cleaners.

These polls are specifically asked with processes within a cell.","We do instapolls with multiple answers","this has not happened.","The homework assignments accomplish this.","We have discussion sections every week to practice the content.","The professor asked about our life values, and asked us to reflect on how they will impact our profession in the future. We have reflection activities like these 3 times a semester.","There are many instances. Most recently, we were discussing all the forces that acted on certain objects. This left room for many answer choices that were all correct.","Dr. [Removed] would ask questions during lecture to the students on how to go about solving a problem. He would state that there are many ways to do the problems and it is up to us to choose. This would happen about every day during lecture.","Usually asks us real life scenarios where we have to think about what will occur. asks us to discuss with people next to us about it","This has not happened! Only one answer to the question.","These are the instapolls that we do every class for in class quiz credit.","He asks us to describe in our words certain principles.","Sometimes a problem has two different ways to approach the question.","Yes he gives us questions that have multiple parts and that have multiple ways to solve them. He also gives credit when you use multiple ways to solve something.","We have instapolls during our class. He opens the question after we go over the topic. We collaborate with our peers and try to solve the problem before he explains the answer to us.","This past month, the instructor gave us open - ended problem - solving exercises where multiple approaches could work, particularly in labs and group discussions. They encouraged us by saying, “ Explore different methods and see what solutions you come up with, ” which allowed us to think creatively and compare our ideas with classmates.","The instructor asked us how we felt about the exam and asked us to give feedback on things we liked and what we didn't like","We had a reflection concerning what it takes to be successful in this course, where we could write our thoughts on it. This was right after the first exam, I believe.","In class, we do practice problems related to the content we are learning in class and he will ask someone from the class to answer for a part of a problem. This happens for the most part, during every class.","Just ask what we think during lecture and also let us provide on opinion in reflections.","In class, we do practice problems. He asks us first to draw our own diagram and try to figure out what's going on. Next, he does the problem step by step and asks the students what to do so that we can apply our learning.","We have instapoll during class and will pick people to answer the questions","At one of the beginning of lectures, the instructor would post an open - ended instapol question regarding gravity. There were multiple answers and he explained each answer choice on why it would be right based on what we dictate our x and y direction to be.","Instapolls during lectures have open - ended exercises but not many with multiple correct answers.","Professor [Removed] always has instapoll questions during his class that allow each student to practice the material from class and see how well they learned / interpreted the material. The questions are usually multiple choice and he allows us to work with our neighbors to see if the same thought process is occurring. Afterward, Dr. [Removed] always tries to go over the question with us so that we all understand the answer and why we might have gotten it wrong if we chose a different answer.","Our instructor tries to keep us engaged in class by opening instapolls.","He will pose a question in which there are several ways to get to the right answer. He will then map out all of the different ways. However, this was overwhelming and often overcomplicated the material.","The instructor tells us to think outside the box and use real world applications which betters my learning.","We always talk in our groups about the topics explained","When we work out the problems in class, sometimes there are not multiple choices, and [Removed] asks us questions as we continue to solve the problem that gets us to think and reach the answer ourselves.","The professor always talks to us after an exam about study strategies and what went wrong.

This allows many answers to be correct.","[Removed] has open ended questions.","Dr. [Removed] will ask the class a question about the topic we are learning about in class and he expects someone in the class to shout out an answer. He does this almost every lecture to get students engaged and know that they are listening.","Day 1 professor asks us if an apple is alive. The answer was unclear. Professor articulated both sides of the argument","Anytime we do our squarecap which is is our daily quizzes he does this. This happens every class.","Our instructor uses [Removed] sessions at the end of each class, and there are often open ended questions that have several correct answers within the [Removed] sessions.","He always gives us real - life scenarios that apply to the material we are learning.","At the end of every lecture he opens a square cap that has open ended questions in it along with the discussion section worksheets due every week.","Dr. [Removed] used [Removed] sessions, which included open - ended questions with multiple correct answers. These sessions take place each lecture which encourages us to explore different perspectives. The instructor emphasized that \" there isn't always just one right answer in biology, \" which helped appreciate the complexity of scientific problems.","During our square cap questions after the lecture is finished there is a variety of questions asked and some are select all that apply ( showing it has multiple right answers ) and free response ( there are different ways you can write the correct answer. This allows us to practice with open ended questions.","In our “ daily ” square cap questions, we often have open ended questions to answer. This allows us to see not only what other students were thinking but also evaluate the accuracy and detailed need of our answers. While credit is given, correct sample answers are provided to study.","Each lecture has a squarecap exercise that is a short multiple choice quiz over the information we covered that day. Students are also asked open - ended questions pertaining to the particular topic.","The professor gives us multiple choice questions over square cap in which multiple answer choices are applicable. He does this after every lecture.","Dr. [Removed] opened up an instapoll that was free response. Instapolls are for an attendance grade, and due to it being free response, there are multiple possible answers students can give, and multiple correct ones too ( probably ).","The class has a lot of content that students have to figure out either on their own or in pairs. The exercise sometimes has an answer but also frequently asks for our opinion and thoughts.","We have Instapolls which are either multiple - choice or open - ended.","She states that you must use the information however you can. She is very helpful for that.","Most lectures are opened with open ended questions that require students to use creativity to problem solve a scenario.","At the beginning of lecture the professor normally has some true or false questions on the board to get us to start thinking about the class.","This happens when we are asked to try solving a data science problem ourselves after learning about it.","Asks these kinds of questions in class always, happens pretty much every class, and just asking the classroom in general.","This happens a lot with our warm - ups where it is a very discussion heavy topic.","We were asked to visualize data using a plot, where we could choose what type of graph to use. This happened in lectures and labs. The instructor gave examples, and walked around if we needed help.","In our independent coding activities, these are the open - ended exercises. While our goal is to complete a certain task, there are several different coding strategies to achieve it, which she encourages.

Sometimes there are multiple correct answers.","We often have problems that can have an assortment of different answers. When this happens, [Removed]. [Removed] will tell us that certain other numbers are acceptable as there are a variety of ways to solve the problem.","there's practice problems during class [Removed]","The instructor had students form groups and had them answer questions from our work packet. Groups put their answers on a slide and the instructor would call on a group.","Since the problems we work through in class are open ended, many people can have various responses. For instance, there could be many things that can be pointed out as an answer any so many variables.

Then she goes over them with us and asks more than one person for what they thought.","During class we have class activities to help aid us in our learning. One time we were given a chart and asked to think of possible plants that were seen in our daily life's and match them to the correct class of plant.

She has LAs come around and teach constructively.","We do several quizzes throughout each lecture, where we are encouraged to work with friends and share our answers to the class.","The instructor only put these open - ended types of questions as bonus attendance questions.","Every class Dr. [Removed] has us do instapoll questions. He explains the problem then discusses it while we are solving it and after we solved it.","Every class Prof. [Removed] has us do multiple instapolls where each stufend attempts to answer a multiple choice question through their devices about the concepts we are currently learning in class. He displays the question on a projector, and he can see the live answer distribution from the class on his laptop. If he sees not everyone understands the problem, he attempts to guide the class in the right direction without telling us the answer. Then, he closes the [Removed] and goes over the correct answer and explains why it is correct.","Dr. [Removed] frequently gives instapoll questions in class, and I remember at least 1 time where multiple options were correct. I think it happened 2 - 3 weeks ago. I don't remember the question.","He taught","The instapolls in class provided an excellent opportunity to do this. It also helped foster relations with the other students in classs.","Asks multiple choice questions in the form of instapolls in class.","gave us a question that had multiple answers","Dr. [Removed] loves presenting challenging, conceptual physics questions at the start of most lecture classes. A good example is his water moving in a circle with a bucket hanging from a string example. Dr. [Removed] also takes written feedback from our pre - lecture homework's, and puts a few of them on the slides to answer during class. This can sometimes precipitate interesting, open - ended conversations too.","There are times where we need to do derivations for problems. Dr. [Removed] will give us a problem and there are multiple ways to derive the correct answer, and he addresses each.","This happens frequently in class with squarecap and on our homework","Just discussing [Removed] questions and exploring the various perspectives and questions that people have.","Every class session there is an open ended question as the warmup which is for participation points and then he goes over the proposed solutions and ideas which helps guide us to the topic of the class.","Our professor uses squarecap to ask questions that promote discussion time to time in class. Everyone is encouraged to talk with their peers and discuss their answers. We eventually come together to discuss right approaches to the question.","I would say with get a lot of open ended questions during squarecap where there are multiple different ways to approach a problem. I like how Dr. [Removed] allows people to share their different perspectives and talk about different ways to analyze a single problem.","Before each lecture, students are required to complete a \" pre lecture \" assignment that ends with an open - ended question. During the lecture, the professor will go over this assignment and read   out some responses and discuss them.","He added a “ [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] \" where there was no correct answer — it was simply a question to think about all the different factors that affect the problem and how it changed the final outcome","I get a lot of open - ended exercises that I can work on based on lecture contents in both lectures and discussions. These helps me a lot to apply what I have learned into the field/ real scenarios.","We have multiple choice, multiple answer questions that we have in our lectures at least once a week. Our professor tells us to choose answers we think will be correct and we share by showing it on our fingers.","She gives discussion questions and discussions time during every lecture and then will discuss with us after we have come up with some answers.","We will go over a topic and then she i'll provide a multiple choice multiple answer question in the topic. They are usually good practice.","Professor [Removed] likes to put open ended exercises in which multiple correct answers are possible in her bi - weekly quizzes. However, to make sure students are prepared for these questions, she likes to put checkpoints in her lectures that contain a practice multiple answer, multiple choice ( [Removed] ) questions. Most recently, I recall Professor [Removed] putting a practice MAMC question in lecture 9 over the origin and diversification of prokaryotes, specifically over the importance of protocells. The way the class answers this is usually holding up with your fingers which answer(s ) you think are correct. I think these questions are helpful if you have studied or understand the material, but it is a little anxiety inducing to hold up your fingers in front of the class, so if a student doesn't know the answer they might just be pressured to copy whatever fingers the rest of the class is holding rather than actually thinking through and answering what they think is best.","In lecture slides and modules, she prepares questions to think and talk about which can be multiple mutiple choice answers and lecture handouts. These are really helpful to make sure one understands the material ( checkpoint )","With the multiple answers multiple choice questions she does often","lots of multiple answer multiple choice questions","A lot of the example Dr. [Removed] provide could have multiple answer.

She would give students time to try solving this on their own or with a friend.","Dr. [Removed] shows us how physics can be unpredictable sometimes, in my opinion she does show us different forms of solving a question.","During discussion she presents problems that are multifaceted. This isn't the professor, but rather the tas","The instructor would usually do some sort of physics demo in class every week and the instructor would ask us to predict what we thought was going to happen during the demo based on the laws of physics. During these exercises we were given a few minutes to discuss our ideas with other students and then at the end he would asks for student opinion and then he would explain the demo and the physics involved. We also do squarecap questions for every class, that engage us in the material.","Every lecture has 2 - 4 questions that encourage students to talk to each other and try to understand what may be going on from a physics perspective in either pre written questions or real life scenarios facilitated by Dr. [Removed]. While the pre written questions have defined answers, our real life scenarios often have multiple explanations that ultimately reflect one main concept. Dr. [Removed] invites students to chat with neighbors regarding possible solutions and explanations and uses our curiosity as fuel for each lesson. He often leaves the lecture on a cliffhanger and encourages students to figure out concepts they don't understand before revisiting these concepts in the next lecture.","He has [Removed] questions every lecture and requires students to answer for grades and ensure attendence.","Dr. [Removed] always asks us multiple questions throughout each lecture. Usually the first question each lecture is just an open - ended question about our thoughts or lives, and we are always given credit for correctness foe these questions.","In lecture, Dr. [Removed] will often ask us questions relating to the material and give us time to think about the answer and talk with our peers before having opportunities to explain our thoughts to the class. Some of these questions have to assume certain things to be true, so there can be more than one answer if some other possibility is taken into account.","Every class, we will have in class discussion questions where we are asked to work with the people around us in discussing different possible solutions.","square cap which we use for participation points and practice applying material, has allowed us to think critically. like there are some conceptual questions we did last week that had more than one answer choice.","He asks us to define terms in our own words","There will be many times when you need to create free body diagrams. The problems can be approached in several different ways and Dr. [Removed] allows his students to begin examples, specifically how we want to identify the coordinate system, and then he helps us follow through with the problem from there.","We would turn to people and ask questions about problem sets \n","We had a square cap question about all the forces acting on an object on an incline plane at rest and were asked to discuss with our neighbors all the forces that applied. This was a select all that apply problem","He asks theoretical questions during lecture that can have multiple correct answers or will also do it through square cap \n","She always asks us questions but wants answers specifically related to each individual student.","In class our instructor asked us to ask our small groups questions about ourselves to get to know each other as people. It also gave us the opportunity to have trust within our class because their were some deep questions.","Every so often our instructor does check ins with the class. In this exercise, we are asked to reflect on our different values, identify them, and explain. These are written anonymously so that students are comfortable enough to be completely honest in their responses.","we did icebreakers today where we talked about what we liked ( career / majors ) and why","Every week, our instructor would ask the class open ended questions. We'd then discuss these questions with the people sitting next to us, and then they'd ask for a few volunteers to share their thoughts, creating a small discussion.","The instructor gives completion based quizzes almost every class over what we covered","During lab we are often asked to find way in which we can solve the problem given to us. There are multiple correct way to solve the problems, but we are encouraged to find our own method that works for us.","In class","This occurs during lab and/or during Instapolls. In lab, we follow a procedure to find our own correct answer. During [Removed], we chat with classmates to figure out which answer on the board is correct.","We are able to discuss different ways to solve problems and understand that there might not be a correct way to solve them. We are able to gain a wide range of experience in different problem solving skills which will help us succeed in the course.","N / a","I didn't write it down","We looked at our homework problems.","Happens with instapolls, we are given a question and we work together as a class to get the answer after selecting what we think is correct","During every lecture, when Professor [Removed] introduces a new concept or topic, we are given a few minutes to speak with our neighbors about a problem to see how everyone understands it. Beyond that, in our discussion sections, the TA always asks us to work as a group to come up with as many definitions for a principle/ property that we learned about during the lecture.","[Removed] has allowed students to discuss in groups about questions and then share afterward. We have shared opinions, thoughts, and ideas, where every person's answer is valued and accepted.","All questions [Removed] have asked, be it study tips, planners, hobbies, interests, he always request that you elaborate on them. He is very open.","We were asked by our instructor to talk about our our studying strategies and how effective they are and discuss them with the rest of the class. This happened a few weeks ago.","Sometimes in class, our instructor likes to start class with a fun game about music or other interests people might have and has some students share what they talked about.","He asks us questions about life skills that have multiple correct answers \n","We participate in these exercises in my [Removed] class and we also participate in this in my American [Removed] class.","We have some open ended questions built into our lecture slides that the professor asks us about."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

She also encouraged us to be diligent in our studies for the next exam.","This is possible through the various office hours available, peer discussion time in class, and instapoll and question types.","There are multiple times during class when we are asked to think about a problem and talk it out with the person next to us. In my opinion, this has been really beneficial to my learning because using active recall over what we are learning makes me apply it. Instead of just retaining information, you get to also explain it with others around you. This makes me feel like we are all following along on the same page and doesn't leave me feeling behind if something doesn't make sense to me right away.","Dr. [Removed] provides us with multiple resources in order to work on our learning strategies. If a strategy seems to not be working, we can always seek help from a TA, go to an academic community, open learning modules, etc.","Following the first exam, our professor instructed us to reflect how our exam preparation strategies and interpret how we could improve on certain strategies in order to improve our performance on the next exam.","In multiple examples in class, it offers more thinking to do, she usually explains the concept, then says that it will be elaborted later on.","She has not really talked much about studying strategies in class. Yet, she still provides study materials that suggest ways to approach studying the material that mention why other ways may not work as well, such as suggesting that we memorize every word on a slide or we will not actually know it.","Before each lecture, [Removed] generally announces any new information that could be useful. For example, she recently mentioned that the review notes would be posted within a certain timeframe, and encouraged us to start looking at it ahead of time.","We were reviewing material we were suppose to learn out of class during the beginning of our class. Then our professor had us answer questions with the aid of our peers to help us find out whether our strategies were successful.","My instructor talked about the importance of not only using the resources she has provided us, but also to use resources we find on our own to improve our studying methods","Our instructor had mentioned this along with the option of course switching.","The instructor emphasizes office hours and makes sure to go over possible question types in class. Additionally, she had a practice exam that allowed us to understand how prepared we are for the test.","After the results for the first unit exam came out, I reflected on my answers and the ones I got wrong. On the explanations I got to understand what I got wrong and how to fix it.","Our Professor often encourages us to delve deeper into the material by doing practice problems and using resources already provided and encourages us to go to office hours if we have any questions. This occurs somewhat frequently around every other week.","The instructor gives us a plethora of class materials to study and learn. We have pre - class modules that walk us through concepts before class, an extensive exam review guide, and multiple ways to ask for help.","Before each unit exam, Dr. [Removed] will release a practice exam to allow students to take to check their understanding and how prepared they are for the real exam. This is especially effective in knowing if their learning strategies worked or not.","Dr. [Removed] allows us everyday to participate in active learning exercises that gets our brain thinking. This allows us to think deeply about each concept and understand.","The instructor has provided practice exams, practice questions, and additional resource curriculum material for our learning.","Caudill provides alot of instapolls and resources to walk us through all the material.","The instructor provided us with opportunities to reflect on our learning and studying strategies by incorporating short self - assessment activities after each major unit like instapolls. For example, one of the insta polls after a recent exam, asked us to complete a reflection on what study methods worked well, what didn't, and how we could adjust for future exams. \n\n\n\n\n","Usually, every class period we have the opportunity to talk with our classmates about the lecture material. We also take weekly instapolls that allow us to answer questions in real time and reflect on our answers with explanation from the professor.","During the week prior to our last exam, Dr. [Removed] always reminded students of the resources available to them","practice exams and questiond","n / a \n","She provides us practice exams before each major exam to let us practice what we have learned and correct us over questions we got wrong.","The professor provides the opportunity for students to reflect after the tests during office hours. She also mentions parts of the other unit during the lecture. [Removed] connects the older lessons to the newer lessons. \n","[Removed] encourages active learning, discourages passive learning. Usually suggests studying at the beginning of class, mentions better ways to study effectively over a course of a couple weeks.","She goes over effective studying strategies. Also, she shows us all of the materials we have to study for the exams, such as practice quizzes, review notes, videos etc","She will let us talk to people around us on how we studied. She will also encourage us to study with others.","I am not sure.","The professor mentioned after each exam that looking over them and seeing what you got wrong and greatly help you understand what you missed and where you could look over again.","Dr. [Removed] gives of quizzes every Wednesday to check our knowledge.","offers new types of strategies ; allows replacement exams for improvement","We are able to communicate with fellow students on study strategies.","Weekly quizzes and surveys like this provide students with opportunities to reflect on the effectiveness of their learning and studying strategies","She gives so many study materials and practice problems on her canvas page that she encourages students to use daily.","The instructor told us to start studying for the upcoming midterm using the materials posted on [Removed]. She also recommended study tips to prepare.","We do in class instapolls and quizzes that allow us to check our learning as we go.","Another thing she does before tests usually. She allows us to share with others what strategies we have and act as if we're talking to ourselves like a pep talk.","After the first test, Dr. [Removed] made us realize if our study habits were truly good in order to succeed in the class. Mentioned getting modules done on time, or studying correctly recesitation or attending academic communities.","Every learning module has three attempts. This provides us with opportunities to redo the question and reinterpret the information.","The professor gives us a list of resources to study on canvas, including practice exams, videos, practice problems with steps to solve them, and more. The professor also encourages us to practice in class while she is teaching the subject. She gives us many opportunities to reflect on how we learn via the small assignments we complete before class as well as the in class quizzes, so that for the exam we know what learning style works for us and which do not.","She created the learning modules and the test question types so we could try various forms of note taking and reviewing strategies.","The course is designed for students to understand how to study better. She has extra credit opportunities, replacement exams, and drops our lowest 3 quizzes.","At the beginning of a lecture after our first assessment, Dr. [Removed] spoke to the class ( and gave us time to reflect ) on our performance on the midterm exam. She explained that \" chances will be given to earn more points if you're not happy with where you are \" and restated the resources available to us.","We have a quiz every Wednesday, and she provides questions like things that would be on the quiz. She is very helpful.","The instructor gives learning modules, quizzes, and exams which test the effectiveness of our learning and studying strategies.","We have quizzes that test our knowledge. They do not have a large impact on our grade, so they are not too scary. I think we take them to know what we need to work on.","We have a quiz once a week at the end of class that helps us see where we are at in our understanding. She teaches what is on the quiz before we take it. \n","The instructor often encourages to engage in group discussion. She believes that in talking out the material with a friend, greater understanding of the concepts will be achieved.","We are able to see the mistakes we made on the test and correct our self's from those mistakes","She provides us with many study guides and extra problems of questions we will see on the test, including a practice test. If we are still having trouble, she provides many more resources that can help us study.","Our professor has not provided substantial opportunities to reflect on the effectiveness of our learning and studying strategies, which could enhance our understanding and application of the material. Without structured feedback or discussion sessions, it becomes challenging to identify and improve upon individual or collective study methods. This lack of reflection impedes our ability to adjust strategies that may be critical for mastering course content and achieving academic success.","After the exam is taken usually, it is available to go back to see what the students have done wrong.","I believe Prof. [Removed]'s lecture style is very straight - forward and focused on the topic at hand, she allows for some time with each practice problem during lecture to explain or discuss to our neighbor what we think the correct answer is.","after exams I know she's talked about different study habits and what works / didnt work","She gives us many exam preparation   materials","The weekly quizzes and also extra attempts allows students to learn from mistakes. More over, it helps students utilize it during study sessions","She recently had an [Removed] in which she wanted us to reflect on how we were going to change our study strategies for the next test, or what we would keep doing if it was already effective. I do believe that she does a good job of encouraging students to utilize resources outside of lecture.","She often tells us to reflect on how we are studying and encourages us to attend office hours","After our exams, our instructor would provide us with a [Removed] [Removed] for us to reflect on how we did on the exam and if our studying strategies worked. She has also provided us with many learning and studying tools for us to utilize for our exams.","After tests. Just asked us to think about what we used and if it worked or not.","She gave us this opportunity by quickly giving us the exam results. Then after that, she would give us the option to retake an exam we did poorly on.","I do not recall this occurring.","After the exams, she allowed us to discuss what we could do next time. She provides us with resources to excel on the exams.","The professor would allow us to reflect on their learning by having tests. If I don't study effectively, then I would have not learned, causing me to fail the exam.","Often times throughout class she has us turn and talk to soeone sitting next to us to relate waht we learned about the topic at hand. Together with somoene sitting near I help solve and help another to solve the question. It is very effective at learning.","The class after the exam, Dr. [Removed] will usually let us have a few minutes to talk about the exam ( very brief ). This happens on lectures after exam days.","She gives out once a week instapolls that can range from answering a question about the course work or a reflective question. Last week, she sent a poll about what we would want to do differently in order to be successful on our next exam. This allowed time for us to reflect on our study methods and if it was effective.","Dr. [Removed] has told us multiple times that we can approach her or TAs with questions from exams or quizzes that we can reflect on.","The instructor gives us quizzes once a week so we can make sure we are studying day by day.","They provide students with the opportunity to reflect on the effectiveness of their learning and studying strategies by allowing students to go over their test during office hours.","Brings awareness to office hours and academic communities. She's really motivating and reminds us that one failing or poor grade does not define our academic capabilities.","[Removed] uses to instapoll after exams to allow us to reflect on our preparation for exams. We even discuss during lecture for some time.","As a final exam, students can retake their 2 lowest exams. 3 lowest quiz grades are also dropped.","I feel like Professor [Removed] is ok, she's really nice but she kind of expects everyone to know what she's talking about. Like even if its something we haven't covered, she goes over it really fast","The correct answers for quizzes are usually revealed, and there are many study resources available for students in different formats.","She asks us to think about our work methods and if it was effective.","The professor gives us exams, exam replacements, and practice exams that allow us to reflect our learning by showing the correct answers after the exam has been taken by everybody. This allows us or review any mistakes. In addition the exam replacements help our grade improve if we chose to retake an exam we did not do well on in the past.","The professor gave students studying strategies before the first exam and after when we moved into a new unit.","Practice exams are provided before every exam. The instructor also provides many practice problems and the type of questions that will be on the exam. The practice exam reflects that.","After exams, we are able to reflect on how we did and what needs to change. We think through how we studied for it and what we need to do differently before the next one.","After Exam 1 Dr. [Removed] said we could retake it in the \" Unit 1 Replacement period \" if we were not happy with our score. She said to go over resources she posted for us to do better.","  Dr. [Removed] always gives us time to speak without classmates about the problem, doing problems together that help me with studying and just working together with our peers. This helps me understand what I know or don't know and helps me connect with my classmates. She does this every week and personally helps me study even though she doesn't specifically mention it as “ study methods ”.","We just get modules to learn the material and then we're just tested over it. Respectfully I think its kind of dumb since the test is randomized for everyone so on the module the question you may suck at won't be as covered compared to the test which just pulls it up. Also If the test is randomized I believe that the practice test should be too.","The instructor gave straightforward quizzes that tested our knoweledge. The instructor also gave us practice exams to allow the students to gauge their readiness and the effectiveness of their studying.","We have been prompted to use our grades to reflect on the effectiveness of our study processes, and thereby improve with the resources available to us.","We took our first midterm in the middle or end of September. She opened our tests after we got our grades back so we could see exactly what we missed and where our studying or understanding may have lacked.","She uses instapolls to ask questions throughout the lecture.","Dr. [Removed] allowed us to speak to those next two us to learn about different approaches to studying and help one another explain better. It happened 1 - 2 weeks ago.","The instructor provided multiple extra practice problems to aid with our preparation for the exam. With those questions we were than provided answers and explanations to those questions.","I was able to reflect on the effectiveness of my learning and studying strategies by the weekly quizzes we have to take every Wednesday lecture. The short quiz was not enough to wreck your grade if you did not perform well, but was enough to allow you to assess if you are actually grasping content in class and see what you need to work on.","We have full access to the exam questions. We can ask the TA for advice on what to fix and how to learn better.","Professor [Removed] encourages us to review our homework and correct mistakes. She also is easily reachable to ask questions.","During the lecture, we are encouraged to work through and discuss in class examples with those sitting around us. This is done about 5 times per lecture, as well as through instapolls which a good check in if we are learning the material at a proper rate.","She has practice tests and study modules.","In the beginning of class Dr. [Removed] has included many references for students to challenge themselves and elevate their studying skills. This was said during the first week of class.","My instructor has reminded us how important it is to reflect and study any topic we learn, specifically the ones we are not too comfortable with. She also reminded us how important it is to ask questions and attend offie hours.","this occurs often through instapolls","The instructor provides resources for students to study or to better understand the material. She does this weekly through recitations, office hours, or \" resource hub \" for exam review.","Usually after every exam our teacher asks us what we think we could have improved on in our studying. She also gives us tips to do this.","My instructor gave our class an instapoll asking what advice we would give to ourselves at the beginning of the semester. I liked this because it helped remind me of my goals.","Dr. [Removed] allowed us to complete instapolls after each midterm to reflect on how our learning process went.","The instructor told us to evaluate a question on our own to see if we could do it by ourselves.","The professor provided students with practice problems and multiple resources for exam preparation. This happens after new topics are introduced, but heightened during review periods. \" I have attached _ _ for you to use when reviewing for _ _. \"","I don't think the professor has ever explicitly stated this, but the entire class is essentially formatted in the style of a flipped classroom, where we study outside of class, and utilize what we studied in class. Learning modules are due right as class starts, so everything we cover is often stuff we had already been exposed to. And so how much you understand in class, depends on how deep you looked into the learning modules.","In the course, the instructor regularly had us complete reflection activities at the end of each unit, where we evaluated our study strategies and how well they supported our learning. For example, after the midterm, the instructor asked us to submit a brief reflection on which study methods we found most effective and which ones we'd change for the final exam. The instructor wrote in the course announcements, “ Take some time this week to think about what strategies worked for you and what didn't. Adjust your approach as needed before the final. ” This gave us the opportunity to actively adjust our methods based on our experiences and outcomes. \n\n\n","She makes use do [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] where we sometimes have to write out our responses with reasonings to the questions. She also has us figure out problems with the people around us.","Typically, Dr. [Removed], after a midterm, will send a survey and ask how the student did, and what they did that was good and bad in terms of studying. Very effective way to visualize what you did to study and how you can improve.","We had an instapoll describing what study habits worked well and what we'll improve for our next exam.","During lecture, Professor [Removed] will tell us about extra practice problems and videos to help solve these problems which greatly help students study for exams.","Today, Dr. [Removed] sent a message to us about studying thermodynamics periodically and not waiting until the last minute to learn all the content. She encourages us to develop good study habits. Also, after tests she makes us reflect about how we prepared for the test and how we could prepare better for the next test on [Removed].","In [Removed] 301, the instructor periodically paused to encourage us to reflect on our study habits, especially before exams. For example, after the first exam, the instructor asked us to consider what study strategies worked well and what we might change, saying, “ Take a few minutes to think about which techniques helped you understand the material and where you might adjust your approach. ” This guided reflection helped us fine - tune our study methods and improved our learning for the rest of the course.","She constantly does instapolls to ask how we are doing and how our studying techniques are. She would probably do it after every test.","After a unit exam, scores were significantly lower than the previous unit across the department, so our professor asked us to reflect and share ( via an instapoll ) what we believe was the reason behind the average lower scores on that specific content.","After each exam, Dr. [Removed] invites students to think about what is working for them and what's not working for them. She consistently has us talk to the other students around us about this, so that we can learn study strategies from each other.","Informed us again about the multiple office hours offered, Encouraged us to attend the academic community to form study groups, and showed different mnemonic devices for remembering the signs of thermodynamic functions ( different hand movements make a plus or minus sign depending on whether or not work is done on or by the system ).","We would speak about our progress in discussion with our discussion leaders. We also spoke about it throughout class.","Gives us multiple resources to use to study with for our quizzes and labs.","I'm not entirely sure","The instructor allowed us to discuss the effectiveness of our c - culture plates","Our instructor walks around the room to facilitate discussions. These discussions often start with a question and lead to our table being left with new information we did not know before.","They would always suggest how to study and improve oursoeves","In my bio lab course, the instructor regularly encouraged us to reflect on our learning strategies, particularly after exams or significant assignments. For example, after our first lab report, the instructor had us complete a short reflection on what study methods worked, what didn't, and how we could improve for future reports. The instructor said, \" Take a few moments to think about how you approached the assignment and whether there's a better way to manage your time or study more effectively. \" This reflection helped refine my approach and better manage my time in future labs.","I would say the reports and quizzes help us reflect on our learning and studying strategies.","Everyday in lab we have to be able to connect previous labs to the current lab and gain an understanding of what that means for the bacteria we have been studying.","Our instructor has provide us the opportunity to attend office hours throughout the course. At these, we would be granted the opportunity to reflect on the effectiveness of our learning and studying strategies and ask for help.","In a prelab not ijbactual class","I can't think of any times that we were asked to reflect on our learning / studying strategies. I suppose grades on the quizzes prompted thoughts on how we studied, but this was not explicitly stated by the instructor. Research reports asked us to reflect on the things we learned, but did not assess the learning strategies that we used.","Whenever we take in class quizzes it is a reflection of what procedures we have learned as well as remembering what the pre - labs are about.","[Removed] is very helpful during her office hours, she offered me advice on how to study for the quiz, how I can prepare for the lab practical, and is really good at answering my questions. For example, I was confused in a step for the gram staining lab after missing it on the [Removed] quiz and I understood it a lot better after speaking with [Removed].","The instructor would tell us tips about study strategies for the bio lab quizzes, and we would be able to take that advice and use it to perform well on the quizzes.","The teaching assistant helps us understand why we are completing an experiment. In addition, she helps us study the meaning behind our experimental results so that we can learn from this to add to our project.","We are given quizzes every now and then in the lab and also assignments to do before coming to class to test / see if are findings / learning has been effective.","I was wrong. We do not do this.","Lab instructor reminds us every lab that she has weekly student office hours to ask any question or concerns!","Sawyer is always asking for engagement from the class and there is often multiple answers that are correct or somewhat correct.","On the quizzes throughout the semester, we are provided with the opportunity to reflect on the information we have learned. It helps us test whether we effectively learned the material or not.","Through our lab photos and reports we are able to really reflect on what we are doing in lab and why we are doing it. We do these every week as a way to tie everything together.","When we take an exam. \n","N / A","We are told to reflect on what we did in the past labs when doing the lab reports.   This happens every week.","There were quizzes that would test our knowledge that we would have to study for.","quizzes","Well like if we messed up following procedures she would tell us how we messed up and then we would do it again","Makes questions to us about learning material","Usually this occurs before one of our quizzes because we have a lot of material to study, so [Removed] usually says that we could form a study group with our lab group or find ways to make studying more efficient.","For every homework, she asks us to write reflection on things that we understand or no. On the test, she also asks us to write reflection, asking us to describe a topic we know.","Professor [Removed] allows us to get feedback on the homework that we complete during discussions and lets us take our quizzes twice ( with a 6 hour break ). This allows us to reevaluate what we understand and what we don't without being penalized. She highlights that she doesn't want us to be afraid to make mistakes because mistakes help us learn better and find our knowledge holes.","We talk sometimes about older course information which allows us to see if we retained information correctly.","After taking the second exam, our professor encouraged us to look back on our study habits and see if we had improved from the first exam in using them. She also added that if there was no change or didn't see much improvement, try using new study methods.","Dr. [Removed] will provide us time within lectures to converse with our group mates about what we have learned concerning the topic. Through this, we discuss our own ideas concerning the material and how we are able to reflect on learning and studying strategies not just from ourselves, but from our peers.","After each exam Dr. [Removed] has us evaluate ourselves and how effectively our studying was. She also provides opportunities for us to talk to her about our grades and study habits.","At the end of each exam, we complete an exit ticket where we reflect on our performance and how we can improve to do better next time. She also includes a study guide in her syllabus on good study taking tips.","The instructor held a discussion with us regarding ways to study and asking us for input on how we managed such things. This happened before our last test.","In every homework assignment, one of the questions requires us to reflect on our learning process through the homework. We have to reflect on our what we learned and how well it worked for us.","She has us reflect on every homework assignment, in which she allows us to reflect on what is clear and what is still uncertain. She also is always there in student hours for help with reflecting on study and learning strategies.","Our homework and quizzes reviews things we learned in class. We also take polls that check our understanding. In all of these assignments, we are encouraged to use critical thinking skills rather than memorization, which is very possible with Dr. [Removed]'s method of teaching.","Referring back to the most recent project, we had a section where we had to describe the molecular reasons for the genetics conditions we were researching, something that was being covered in class, thereby applying what we had learned towards [Removed] conditions. This shows how if what we truly understood what we had grapsed.","The instructor has provided opportunities for students to reflect on their experience in the course. The instructor was very clear that students all have the capacity for improvement and where we are now does not define us at people nor students.","She created this group system where she gives every student a chance to answer questions by calling out specific group names.","I thought about meeting the TA to go over the exam. This happened recently this week and it was sent out through an announcement.","She would ask a reflection question after each homework. This helped us reflect in the concepts that we did or did not understand in class.","Dr. [Removed] has provided us with study suggestions and has encouraged us to adopt healthy study habits.","Gives us studying strategies on canvas and in person.","My instructor has been very encouraging regarding practicing effective learning and studying strategies by allowing students to consider how their strategies and experiences can be applied to our future careers. She also encouraged us to reflect on how non - academic experiences have led us to making the decisions we made and entering our desired career field.","The instructor would hold office hours twice a week. The instructor would also send announcements to share with us how we can improve studying strategies.","Allows us to test out knwolehe through weekly quizzes and homework, as well as apply them in class through instapoll.","In lecture and in her students","When the first test grades were released she offered opportunities to discuss the questions missed and what to change in your approach to be ready for the next test.","Dr. [Removed] has study tips posted on the class canvas for students to access. She also sent out an announcement today, which included her personal suggestions to prepare for the upcoming exam.","My instructor gave us time to reflect on our college journey and think about plans for the future. This happened a week before our first exam. Dr. [Removed] then made us write this out on a green sheet of paper.","Professor was talking about study strategies for the first midterm, and the advice was not to go over the lecture recordings or re - organize the notes, but to go over the homework problems and quizzes that I got wrong. That actually hit me because I was going to waste my time re - organizing the notes over the weekend before the exam if she didn't point it out.","We had an exam and she sent an announcement along the lines of evalaute what your studying process was leading up to the exam.","Class disuccsions are really helpful","She always gives us opportunities to practice and to reflect upon our mistakes.","She lets us do reflections as exit tickets","Dr. [Removed] has provided us with tips on positive study and life habits. After the first exam, we were provided with a reflection that allowed us to consider the state of mind we were in during the exam and how our study habits may have affected our grade. This influenced me to reconsider how I am studying, and I ended up doing better on the second exam.","After the exams, specifically after the first one, she sent out a message to remind us that it is ok if we didn't do as well as we hoped as well as giving us strategies to improve for the next exams.","Dr. [Removed] has show us multiple videos on growth mindset and send us messages on how to improve. We also get a second chance on our weekly quizzes which are graded with feedback so we can improve our score.","We recently finished taking our midterm and with that she asks us to look at was has been working for us and what hasn't. She also gives opportunities to talk to TAs and ask for help to improve.","Dr. [Removed] has reflections for exams.","yes we have exit tickes that do just that","She emphasizes learning from the mistakes, and she gives one more opportunities to get full credit.","During the discussion section after our first exam, we were given a paper that walked us through reflecting on the effectiveness of our studying and learning for the previous exam.","After exams, Dr [Removed] encourages her students to meet with her or the TAs to discuss their grade. This meeting typically involves discussing whatever you have done wrong and what you can improve on in the future.","After an exam, my TA and Dr. [Removed] will both have surveys based on what was helpful compared to what was not and we are able to see what other students thought so we can change our study habits.","Dr. [Removed] allows us to take our weekly quizzes twice, with a 6 hour break between each retake. This is very helpful as sometimes I do not prepare well enough and preform poorly on a quiz. The 6 hour break between quiz retakes allows me to really study the questions that I did not get right on my first attempt.","Dr. [Removed] has a great teaching style. He stops and gives times during class to ask questions and work through problems.","He encourages us to ask questions and checks for learning throughout class.","Since we have [Removed] weekly reflections, prof always talked about reflecting on progress and about growth mindset. i appreciate stuff like this","We always get multiple attempts on the homeworks and attempts to work out the instapoll with another person. Lots of collaboration and trials to learn.","Every class Dr. [Removed] does practice problems over the concepts we are learning at that time. He also uses these practice problems to introduce new content and show how he would approach the problems. Then at least once a class we try to do a problem on our own.","When we do the required reflections we are required to reflect on our habits!","This week, Dr. [Removed] went over the responses of the reflection that was submitted be everyone in the class. This allowed us to all be reflective not only by our own responses to those questions but also to be able to see others take and reflect on that as well.","Before we complete each on of our midterms, Dr. [Removed] assigns us a reflection in which we analyze our learning mindset. Accordingly, we talk about thinks that we can improve, and that we can all make it through this class.","After we received our grades for our midterm 2nd exam, our professor encouraged us to review our exams as the average was lower. He even gave us a chance to learn and gain some points back \" success is not a linear slope so please do not be discouraged by this. \"","Every month we have had a reflection on how it would be effective to study for tests, how to prepare for homeworks and class.","after every exam we go over what it means to have a growth mindset and what it takes to evolve as a student within the course.","Dr [Removed] gives us a reflection assignment after each midterm that gets us to think about what we did well and how we can change our studying strategies to do even better on the next exam.","We do reflections after each exam that allow us to reflect on our study habits and what we can improve on before the next test. This allows us to take time and think back on the effectiveness of our learning","Last week, Dr. [Removed] had us complete a growth mindset assignment where we could reflect on the course and what we are doing to prepare for Midterm 2.","The instructor would ask us after a homework assignment or exam if we found it difficult and how we felt about it. He would also include lecture slides over the idea of a growth midset when it came to physics for us to feel more motivated and evaluate in our current studying habits.","When we have exams, we have to submit reflections to let the teaching team know how we're feeling about the exam and what we've done to prepare for the exam.","He makes us take these surveys. Also when everyone did bad on the second exam he allowed dus to take another exam for half points back. He recommended we talk to him in [Removed] about how we study and works for us.","He helps students do this through the ed discussions.","As previously mentioned, the instructor would assign reflection assignments in order to talk about our individual experiences with the class so far. By doing so, the instructor encourages us to be more active in learning such as talking to our neighbors all around us.","We had an assignment that required us to reflect on our study habits before the first exam. We were also asked which aspects of our study habits are in or out of our control.","Dr. [Removed] has assignments to help us reflect on our course experience and employ a growth mindset.","The instructor emphasized reflection by creating an assignment ( with points worked in ) to do so. The results of this reflection were then aggregated to be discussed in class, focusing on what aspects students found in and out of one's control.","It's a physics class. That's what we do","The professor gave us a survey where he asked us what we would recommend other students do to study for this course, and also asked us what things are in our control to be successful in this course. He then went over our responses briefly in class.","Dr. [Removed] implements reflective assignments to promote a growth mindset. He also has offered office hours after an exam to reevaluate study strategies and what mistakes were made on the exam.","he provides reflection assignments to do on canvas","The last test was a good example for this, as the instructor gave us time to reflect and study more before making up our grade.","We have reflections before we take the next midterm exam for the class.","These surveys and post exam pep talks","He gives us reflections that we have to complete so it helps us out. He also asks us what we can do better and more.","He typically makes us fill out a reflection of how we are feeling after a difficult exam. In doing so, it encourages students to think about what strategies they use and how effective they are.","as previously mentioned, we are encouraged to have a growth mindset. With a retake exam, we can reflect on our previous studying methods. He told us to keep a growth mindset.","The professor asks questions throughout every class that can have multiple correct answers, typically after doing a demo that involves conceptual perception. He also tries to guide the class in the correct direction by elaborating on \" wrong \" answers given that can help make the students feel more comfortable sharing and participating.","N / A","We went over reflection 2 in class.","Our instructor would place us in small groups to go over course material. It was often in these groups that we would given a \" [Removed] \" worksheet that would act as a good check for understanding over what we were being taught.","Dr. [Removed] gives us assignments to prepare for exams. This is helpful practice for application purposes.","we were given an exam analysis form after we got our results back from the exam and were asked to reflect on what we missed, what we could've done better, and how we will ensure this.","After every lesson we have a quiz. These really help deepen the understanding on what was taught throughout the lesson and test if you understood the information that was told. This is a great time where you can interact with the TA's and the professor, this is also an amazing tool to see where you need to focus your studies on.","The professor required everyone to submit Test Reflection forms after the first test to ensure everyone reflected back on what they got wrong, why they got it wrong, and what to improve on in their study strategies in the future.","He gives us exam reflection assignments","The instructor would post an assignment where students would look at their test and determine which learning strategies allowed them to succeed the most and which are needed to improve on future tests.","Every time after the exam, he provides the reflection form to evaluate ourselves and give us time to think about the mistakes and learning strategies. This activity helps me to improve my inner mind and helps me to plan about the future plans.","Each week, Dr. [Removed] will assign us a discussion worksheet and a homework quiz, which both allow us to reflect on the effectiveness of our studying.","Every week we have activities in the class in which we answer questions pertaining to the lecture we discussed.","Yes has square cap in class","exam analysis","This happened after our first exam, Dr. [Removed] sent out an exam reflection for us to fill out to reflect on how we did on the first exam and whether our study strategies were helpful.","We were able to go back after test one and reflect on our studying skills as well as other things to improve.","He gave us a post test review to look at the stuff we had done well on and content we hadn't. It was mostly just a review of how our test went and asked about our studying habits.","The professor had us fill out a worksheet after the first exam for us to reflect on our perfomance.","This class moves very quickly so if you fall behind it is very difficult to catch up. I think that Dr. [Removed] tries to help us, but doesn't always.","Today, when he gave us this survey, but if he did before, I do not remember.","Dr. [Removed] has exam post - mortems, where he has you go over each individual question from the exam and explain if you got it correct ( and if not, why ). Then he links that to a broader area of expertise that you may need to study more. In class, he discusses the value of certain studying techniques, and he has done this consistently since the beginning of the semester.","The instructor provided a place for students to do a reflection on the past test in order to understand why they missed the questions they did in order to push a student to study more effectively in the future.","This often occurs when we do our exam analysis sheet after an exam. We see what questions we got wrong, analyze why we got them wrong, analyze our study methods, and ponder whether we should do something differently.","After our first exam, our professor had us fill out an exam analysis form where we reflected on why we didn't get the question right. There were four categories, memorization, understanding, application, or just a simple mistake like misreading.","After exam 1, Dr. [Removed] gave us a analysis form and we were able to go back and see our exam and what we got wrong. This gave me the opportunity to go back and see why I didn't get this question right and what I could do differently next time,","Exam analysis form","Dr. [Removed] would often before an exam and give some advice on how to study, and effective ways to learn the information on the exams. Which was something that I found to be really helpful.","After the exam, the instructor ensured that the TAs would go over the material in our discussion sections. From there, the TA gathered feedback on what worked for the group and provided their insight and advice too.","Dr. [Removed] gives us an exam analysis review sheet to look over our questions and allow us to realize why we got questions right and why we got questions wrong on an assignment. It helps me understand how my study habits contribute to how effective I perform on these exams.","After the first test, Dr. [Removed] sent out an exam analysis survey. This allowed me to go back and look at the questions I missed.","What : Dr. [Removed] gave us an assignment were we evaluated our exam 1 outcome. \n When : This happened nearly after a week past the exam to receive feedback. \n Words : Complete by a certain deadline, review the exam problems and our responses.","Sometimes questions in the square caps will be covered in the text book and not directly in class. Dr. [Removed] has made it a point to study the text book before arriving to class.","She gives us questions to discuss with our peers, and she will discuss all answers later and no answers is wrong","I think every time we explain what we found or what a visual means, we are reflecting on the learning we are doing in the course.","The homework problems and lab times are great opportunities to reflect on materials learned and collaborate with other students. The instructor always gives time to try the problem before she shows the answers which gives me an understanding of the topics.","We are given a dataset to analyze and we are given open questions that we are able to apply our knowledge to.","We've had a couple different instapolls at different points throughout the semester that asked us how well we think we're understanding the material. The professor also talked about different ways to try to learn better for the rest of the course.","At the beginning of the semester, the instructor outlined that it would be a very hand - on learning approach with lots of practical application of what we are learning in class.","Dr. [Removed] makes sure to ask how familiar students feel about the content or lesson before moving onto the next topic. This not only allows her to check on the effectiveness of her learning, but also enables students to reflect on their learning and see how much of an understanding they have.","It is throughout the course, with labs and homework as well as the project. It requires us to use what we have learned and with [Removed] we can get input on what we did right and what we did wrong.","She gives out extra credits and so much help","Office hours allow us to go over our work and gradescope comments tell us what we did wrong","The instructor has done progress checks a couple of times during the term where they ask students how comfortable they are with certain concepts or tools. These were done as a survey during class.","Every class we have worksheets that we work on throughout the class. Each worksheet has a \" Try it \" section, where we try on our own to attempt the content covered in class, which I think gives people a chance to reflect on how much they actually learned.","Dr. [Removed] has regular check - ins about project material to help keep us on track. She also has us answer surveys such as this one.","The time to reflect on learning and studying strategies always comes to be the lab sessions, where students work in groups to apply the methods they have learned. If I find the lab difficult, I know to adjust my studying for next time so that I am more prepared.","I don't have a clear memory about this. But, overall, the HWs are a good example of seeing where we are at with the learning! If we don't understand how to do something in the HW, that probably means we are not properly learning the concepts presented.","Since this course is more project - based, I feel it is not as relevant as in a test - based course","The instructor often instructs the students to compare opinions / answers in groups to learn from each other. Additionally, during lecture, she frequently asks us to work on a chunk of code before she goes over how she did it, so we can learn through trial and error and also ask questions to reflect on our efficiency.","As part of this class, we're required to work on a semester project. Our most recent assignment included a reflection component regarding the project.","Dr. [Removed] often has us pause and discuss a topic with the people around us during lecture.

Which helped us reflect in our answer and approaches to getting the answer","She created survey and instapolls to ask us feedback and progress of projects.","This happen through our labs. We use what we have learned through the week to formulate a strategy and conduct it.","For example, you have two chances on the prelab which allows you to take a step back and reassess what you have done wrong or right and retake it.","Today in class, she gave us time to look over our quizzes and reflect on our grades. She provided a safe environment to ask questions and learn about our mistakes","There are practice questions that the professor has students do   during the lecture right after certain topics are discussed, then there is a chance to review and learn from, if you made any, mistakes.","Since the class started at the beginning of this semester, the professor always goes over various examples having to do with whatever she just went over. For example, when we were learning about standard deviation, she explained to us how we could find it and then let us work in groups to come up with the standard deviation of specific problems.","During lab hours, our TAs would help with opportunities regarding studying strategies and effective learning. They bring a different perspective to lectures.","When going over the recent quiz, she made sure to include that if students were not happy, they could evaluate how they took notes or studied for the course. She said that specifically to her, she recommended studying notes the day after class to reinforce the material.","My professor always allows us to work on worksheets in the middle of lectures or towards the end, so we can apply what we just learned.","I think lab sections and working together in class are effective ways for us to reflect on how well we know the material. When I work with other people in my class I better understand where I stand and realize what I could improve on based on the people around me.","Dr. [Removed] encouraged us to look through notes and do practice to make sure we are understanding the material. This was said to help us undertstand how to prepare for the quiz","Before the quizzes, there is practice quizzes to test your knowledge. I find that to be extremely helpful because it prepares me for the exam. Also, the material is what is taught.","There was a quiz that tested us on the content, this will give the students an opportunity to reflect on the effectiveness of their learning and studying strategies.","Posted slides explaining how to study better for quizzes","After each quiz, she opens our responses / questions up so we can see what we did wrong. She has also provided several study tips throughout the semester.","This mainly happens after quizzes where she provides feedback and goes through the most missed questions on the quiz.","I feel like we kind of get to reflect on how our studying strategies were effective when it comes to the quiz averages and how we did on them.","After we take a quiz, Dr. [Removed] gives us time to reflect on the stats of the questions in the next lecture.","We do instapolls everyday when we are allowed to talk with the people around us. Definitely helps with the effectiveness of our learning. Before test we do study guides with our discussion groups which outline every learning objective.","After the first midterm, Dr. [Removed] provided us with the opportunity to go over the most missed problems on the midterm during our weekly discussions with our TA to clear up possible misconceptions.","After our first and second midterms, she made sure that we all saw the grade distributions for our class. And then she sent out study resources that we can use and office hours for those that did not do so well. In discussion we also go over the most missed questions for the exam.","She gives out in class instapolls to check if the class is on the same page and got the materials down. Also she has resources posted on canvas with weekly reading survey quizzes that students can take.","After exams we are prompted to think about our study time and strategies","Discussions are very application based and showcase what we are learning","I feel the instapolls the instructor does in class lets the students reflect on what they have learned. This happens every class.","She would show us the class grades after the exams and have the TAs go over the most missed problems in discussion. This happens after every exam and she would remind us about the available resources to study.","We were asked to take a survey about our progress in the course about beginning of [Removed] and what the professor could do to help us succeed.","Our weekly discussion activites and reading summary quizzes, and our daily instapolls serve as a way to reflect on the effectiveness of our learning and studying strategies","After tests, we go over the test in discussion to understand what we did wrong and provides an example of how we should study","Square cap questions in class.","She gives 10 - 20 question homeworks on quest. These homeworks are weekly and cover the content learned in class.","After the first exam, students were allowed to take a retake exam the following week. This allowed students who wanted to improve their scores to review their mistakes, assess their weak areas regarding the material, and consult the professor and TAs for methods to improve.","Dr. [Removed] provides us with the opportunity to retake our exams. I think this is the best way to provide students with the opportunity to reflect on the effectiveness of their studying strategies. Dr. [Removed] provides students with the average exam grade of the in person exam and the retake exam.","She gave us tip to study and options for office hours","At some point during the lecture, Dr. [Removed] would ask us questions that were related to the coursework and would invite discussion among the students to figure out which answer would be the best choice. She would always give us a signal to meet with our neighbors for a couple minutes and that amount of time would allow us to reflect on what we have learned from classes prior and in the current lecture to figure out an answer, and this was a good way of letting us see how effective our learning strategies were.","She does in class quizzes. She also has exams and retake exams.","We received the results for our exam, and if you were not happy with your score, the instructor offered to talk during office hours. The instructor even added extra time for students to come in and discuss their study strategies.","After exams, the professor provides an opportunity to speak with her regarding study strategies and how to improve in this course.","She gives us these styles of surveys a few times a semester with the hope we reflect on our time in the class.","After taking exams and receiving our scores back, we are able to re - take the exam the next week. This gives us the opportunity to evaluate our learning and studying strategies and adjust them before attempting to be tested on the material again.","The instructor provides instapolls to students during classes to make sure that we understand topics, and can apply that understanding to answer questions. Based on how we do on these questions, they provide reflection on our learning. The homework has a similar impact.","My teacher allows us to do practice problems in class. There we are testing our knowledge and inversely testing our learning and study skills. He sees what percentage of our class understands and fills in any gaps in our knowledge.","After each exam he allows us to reflect on how our studying paid off or didn't pay off. Then we can retake the exam the following week after having time to make adjustments.","The professor would show the class average on the days after a test. In which he would begin to give some advice for each grade grouping.","This happened after the first exam. The professor told us to “ reflect on our study habits ” to see if they were effective or not based on our performance.","His exams are probably the best way to see if your learning and studying strategies are effective, and if they aren't, he gives the opportunity for you to retest the week after. During that week you can find or ask new ways to learn and study that are more effective.","He provides us with a second test over the same material. They are different questions, but you get to reflect over your first test and see what new topics you need to cover or what to look over.","Gives us guidelines on things we should study and highlights important topics","Although a lot of content is covered in a short time for this course, the professor provides ample opportunities for student reflections. Extra credit is counted toward attending office hours, which motivates students to consider their learning strategies.","Mainly in the study sessions, I get an understanding as to whether or not I understand a topic and how I work on the topic to better understand it","Provided test retakes for each test. Gave people opportunity to figure out what about their studying was right or wrong.","Talked about how to approach certain subjects.","After exams, we are able to make up half of the points lost on incorrect questions by writing down the procedure of the question and how to derive the correct answer. This has helped me personally change my approach to many questions and fully understand what I'm doing.","He actually does inform us quite often about how if we have questions about the homework to ask in our discussion sections or if not to just ask in our online chat to learn from one another.","We have time to think about our answers when we do things on square cap in class. He said we should try to change our approach if we did not get the grade we wanted on the test and also gave us a chance to make corrections to do better grade wise.","Dr. [Removed] offered a potential 50 % points back on the points you missed if you explained why you got the answer wrong thoroughly and what is the correct answer and why. This happened after our first exam. \" You are able to come to office hours and I will personally help you complete exam redoes.","Now that we have our first exams back, we are able to redo for half the points back. During the redo process we must go into more detail when redoing the question. This process will allow us to reflect on what we know and don't. When seeing the gaps in our knowledge, we can then adjust our studying techniques.","I m not too sure","He allows us to correct our exams, only if we show a clear problem solving method. He is also very encouraging to students to come to his office hours.","Again this goes into the squarecap thing where he gives us time to think and discusss.","This survey is one of those times he's allowing us opportunities to reflect on our experience. He generally allows us to talk about our learning experience in participation questions and tries to stay in tune with the thoughts of his students.","The instructor provides students with opportunities to reflect on the effectiveness of their learning and studying strategies by giving us \" quiz reflections \" after each quiz. The instructor also typically speaks briefly about how to succeed in the course.","In the course we submit quiz reflections in which we evaluate our study strategies. We also reflect on how we can do better studying next quiz.","We recite the learning objectives","After our first quiz, Dr. [Removed] published a quiz reflection assignment that allowed us to reflect on our study habits for the quiz and what we did well versus what we could have done better. She provides a quiz reflection after each quiz.","We would have questions during lecture to keep us engaged and to see if we truly understand the topic. If not then she would go over it again.","The professor gives us in - lecture questions for us to answer as a class. She then goes over the questions and asks if we have any doubts about the question or the topic.","The instructor gives us quiz reflections where can reflect on our learning strategies and learn from mistakes.","We can give feedback on our quizzes after taking them.","Dr. G's assignments always have students reflect on what we learned during the week. Each week, she asks us to submit questions from that week's lectures and then answers them for us.","Gave extra credit and lecture assignments","She provides opportunities for us to reflect over quizzes and rework answers","During office hours, the instructor motivates multiple students to try and solve given problems and each student executes the given problem through varying methods. This allows for the student reflection of their approaches and habits towards their studying and learning.","Dr. [Removed] always tells us to just take a little bit of time after lecture at some point in your day to go over what we learned because it will stick better. After the first midterm she mentioned how if we were not happy with our grade we should look at our study strategies and do things different and we can also come to her if we have any questions or need help.","Same as before","Following exam 1, we did a survey giving feedback about the exam, but one of the questions asked for a reflection about the effectiveness of our studying strategies leading up to the exam and what we could do better when studying for the next exam.","After we took our test, he showed us charts of the scores we predicted versus what we actually got, and we talked about the trends.","After taking the first midterm, Dr. [Removed] is encouraging us to talk to him, the TA, or the LA about how we study and the best ways to spend our time. We were also encouraged throughout our class time so far to discuss topics with other students next to us.","My Professor has gone into depth on how to improve our test taking and studying skills to better improve our academic life in college. This was discussed 2 weeks ago.","In one of our classes, we were covering studying and how to prioritize our work. This helped teach me how to balance work with everyday life and I now am a much more organized person because of the class.","I specifically remember the second week, where she helped us develop our own calendar and ways to \" prioritize \" certain events in our calendar. This allowed us to analyze our learning strategies and perhaps make some changes in our schedule.","We would get papers to fill out on how we are as a person and reflect on it. We all did activists during the lectures to help solidify our knowledge of the topic.","He tells us every Friday how he saw our scores for quizzes and not to worry because there are more opportunities.","We actually had a class day dedicated to our learning and studying strategies. We cover different methods that have helped other students in the past and reflected on how we can improve our own skills.","He made it clear that the first exam is like a \" check - in \" exam, if you do bad on the first one he talks about ways to improve for the next one. He also drops the lowest grade, which helps people get on their feet","The instructor told us to think about how we are studying for the upcoming exam and encouraged us to apply alternative study skills and deeply understand the course material.","Following our first midterm about a month ago, our professor spent a little time at the end of a lecture going over the results, most missed problems, and possible strategies to improve one's score. Additionally, our professor spent some time informing us about where we approximately need to be if we want X score in the class ( ex : what homework average and test average we need to get an A ).","After our midterm our professor to some time out of the following lecture to discuss the results of the exam as well as what that means for us going forward. During this talk, he mentioned that if we did well then we should think about what we did that led to that success and that if we didn't do so well we could consider taking a new approach and getting extra help in office hours.","I met with my instructor to talk about what I could be do better on in the course. He saw that I was struggling and was willing to provide advice on what I could improve on.","We took 3 midterms. Throughout the semester, these midterms show us how we are performing academically.","I know the professor did this, but I'm not sure how exactly he did it. He mostly encourages reflection following exams, asks us to reevaluate our preparation methods, and suggests ways to study.","We would","Within Dr. [Removed]'s syllabus, she gives you the opportunity to have the best course outcomes by replacing your quiz grades with each respective midterm grade if the average is higher. She does this for her [Removed] as well, showing that if you can completely master the material, regardless of time, you can still be successful.","Professor [Removed] likes to start class with a student reflection on the course. These often include studying strategies.","She always asks us what we need more help with. Also, we have instapolls and that is a good way for her to see our progress.","I'm unsure on what exactly the question is referring to, but I do know she gives out instapolls every lecture class to promote our engagement in the class and help prepare us for tests.","using homeworks and test retakes.","The only example I can think of this was the first midterm. After we took it and saw our grade we had an opportunity to retake the exam with new strategies.","Professor [Removed] gives her students many opportunities to improve their study strategy through providing constructive criticism of our personal answers and thought process of getting toward them throughout the course. For students struggling, she regularly offers office hours time for them to better understand concepts.","One lecture our instructor discussed effective and ineffective study strategies, as well as instructing us to construct an academic planner for a class ( or multiple if we so chose to. ) We later followed up the following lecture with our academic planner by comparing it to our peers, allowing us to gage the importance of time management.","Discussed about our study habits and how to better organize and prioritize certain tasks within our personal schedule. \n","Once in an assignment I wasn't able to comprehend, my instructor suggested mostly that students should just remember what they understood in the reading.","This can be shown by the mandatory TA sessions where we do practice problems. In these sessions we show hoe effectively we have learned, and if we are struggling we can ask for help.","Dr. [Removed] would describe how we can reflect on learning strategies before and after exams and figure out what works and what can change and help us utilize resources upon that."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":1},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
