I'd also say to make sure you're organized when getting pictures from lab and keeping up with everything.","This course involves a lot of note taking, and learning modules however, if you apply yourself you can earn a good grade. Not going to be an easy A, but you will earn whatever grade you get.","Chemistry is a course that explains the inner workings of the elects found in the periodic table and how their interactions and structures affect each other and life.","It is an intro biology course that is highly specific and rigorous. It is a difficult class that has very specific content.","[Removed] 301 covers the basic principles of chemistry within 4 units. These units are atoms, bonding, gas laws, and thermodynamics. Dr. [Removed] is a fantastic lecturer and does her absolute best to provide whatever support she can foor her students.","Amazing for people that want to learn the foundational skills for both statistics and data analysis","It is pretty fun and not super hard \n","I think the class is a lot more fast - paced than an AP [Removed] class, but the content so far seems fairly similar and we are given tools to help us learn the material in more depth at a faster pace.","Most / all of the course is focused on R, we don't do any equations or probability ( at least so far ).","Fundamental application of chemistry to real world solutions that help you understand the world.","The professor is very efficient at making sure that students understand the basic concepts. When it comes to the homework, it's hard but allows you to fully apply the concepts learned in the lecture","The coursework isn't overbearing, and the professor is very helpful. However, it is a lot of studying, and it goes beyond basic comprehension.","The class is a lot about memorization and how to implement the knowledge in practice.","This course is very hands on and interesting. If you want to feel like an actual scientist, take the course.","This course is very eye - opening and helps you see how the world interconnects on many levels.","This is a course in which we learn mainly about the physiology of living organisms and how their populations change over time.","I would say that this course is doable but a lot of work.","It is a good [Removed] course that has good lectures! I recommend because the staff is very open to explaining in deeper detail when needed.","This course help you find and understand the resources [Removed] [Removed] offers.","This course, as implied by its title, really allows you to learn in - depth about the general field of chemistry.","Well organized and easy if you keep up with the work","[Removed] is an introductory chemistry course focused on fundamental concepts like atomic structure, bonding, thermodynamics, and chemical reactions. It's a foundational class that requires good study habits, as it covers a lot of material and prepares you for more advanced chemistry courses.","The [Removed] 301 course is rigorous. However, it give you the ability to think outside the box.","Flexible course with a mix of lectures, quizzes, exams, and instapolls.","This class is a lot of work but the content is kind of interesting.","It is not easy. However, if you put in the work, you will get the grades you want.","The content can be hard to understand sometimes, but Dr. [Removed] is really good at explaining the content. The class can take some effort, but it is definitely possible to get a good grade.","This course provides a hands - on biology lab experience with applications to the real world.","The course is very manageable if you practice a bit everyday.","This class is manageable in terms of work, and Dr. [Removed] is a fantastic teacher who makes the class engaging and doable.","It is a sort of basic chemistry class which covers mainly the topics learned in AP [Removed]. It is not a very intimate class because the class size is so large. It isn't really hard if you understand chemistry ; however, many of topics are taught sort of differently from what I learned in AP but of course that varies high school to high school.","Not a lot of work, but if you don't keep up with it you will fall behind.","This course is challenging because you are responsible for teaching yourself the material. You have to allot plenty of time before and after class to study and make sure you know the content.","Definitely a little harder than I expected, but I love Professor [Removed]. You can honestly tell she cares about her students.","This course is challenging and you will have to study. You need to go office hours and tutoring.","Learning the science or physics between each motion.","not easy but not too difficult \n","Difficult course material at times but overall not too bad. \n","Self paced learning with supplemental instruction in lecture","They help you with the transition into college, it's really helpful.","It's a small lab where you work with this organization on antibiotic resistance and how to identify bacteria.","This course is about learning the basics of statistics and being able to form conclusions based off given data.","Learning about the evolution of species.","It's friendly and open","It is a chemistry course that is pretty easy, but it is pretty dependent on the online modules.","This course is challenging but not unreasonably so.","The course is relatively difficult, the lectures are not the most helpful and the majority of the material needs to be self - taught. \n","I would describe this course as sufficiently challenging, but forgiving at the same time. You always have a chance to make up for past mistakes / misunderstandings.","An introduction to [Removed]. Its a very interesting course and I find it to be incredibly well organized with an engaging professor.","Genetics is a really interesting course that uses a lot of application based questions. It is overall a difficult course but Dr. [Removed] is so nice and the TA's are very helpful.","This course is about understanding the thermal processes of the universe such as heat and energy, using statistical mechanics to make sense of it.","This course is very interesting and involves hands on experiments that are very engaging. It is also easy to maintain a good grade as long as you keep up with your work, which is not a large amount of workload.","It is a step up from mechanics but it is an interesting subject. The concepts in this class are much more abstract and a lot of the questions are more qualitative.","This course has a lot of resources available and very straightforward. There are academic communities to go in for help","With this course, you can develop your lab skills and actually feel like you're making an impact in what you're doing.","Challenging but managable","This is a class designed to help freshmen transition into college.","If you do the learning modules and homework you will do fine in the class.","A course where we get to evaluate the properties of an electron and it's affect on elements.","Very different from physics 1. Much more difficult, and not nearly as intuitive.","This course is pretty straightforward and is a great into to chemistry class for CNS students.","Content heavy, need to dedicate a large amount of time to study and practice.","A must - have for people with interest in physics or chemistry ( it combines both and offers a transition to connect the two sciences )","Great course! Interesting and exciting to do antibiotic research","Bio lab is a course that is laid back but still teaches you about the crisis of antibiotic resistance while also being able to teach you new skills like subculturing.","Great resources and exam practice but the lectures are a little fast paced.","Dr. [Removed] is a really encouraging professor","Very lenient. Not grade based","It is very hard.","I would say this course is not extremely difficult however a lot of work needs to be done outside of lecture to succeed.","It is about electricity and magnetism. The profesor is very nice and welcoming to answer questions and the retakes on the test make it leas stressful.","This course is difficult, and the teacher isn't very good at explaining things. You have to teach yourself the material using the textbook and homework questions.","Amazing course to start a journey in stats","It might seem tough and might require a substantial amount of dedication for succeeding, it's an extremely interesting class and it's worth it.","This course works to explore the basis of physics. And does so in a way that relates to our every day lives.","It requires a lot of studying.","There's a lot of weekly experiments and lab reports, as well as three cumulative quizzes and a semester - long poster data - gathering trend.","The [Removed] [Removed] class is a small, comfortable class that helps new students adjust to college life. The class goes over things such as time management skills, career paths, and future course advice. It is low stress as it is a pass / fail class, so as long as you show up you get a good grade.","I would tell them it is largely dependent on their own learning outside of the class and to not rely on lectures to learn the material.","This class is an introductory course to general chemistry.","This is an intro biology lab that works with the tiny earth project aimed to combat the antibiotic crisis.","It focuses on the fundamentals of physics, and it is very math and practice problem heavy. It has a decent pace if you keep up with it.","This course is a very well - paced introduction to chemistry that provides plenty of resources to succeed.","Get ready to memorize many things and systems, and how they impact and relate to eachother.","this course is all about bacteria : how to sub - culture and grow it as well as how to test it for various things.","It is a difficult and challenging course that requires a lot of critical thinking.","This course is a mixture of evolution with biology 2 concepts. Its focus is on environmental relationships.","Very well organized and easy if you put in the work","The course goes over all the material necessary, but work outside of class needs to be done","It's pretty fast paced but very easy to manage and stay on top of assignments.","Easy if you took AP chem, tests are fair, modules provided are very helpful.","the class is challenging but can be rewarding at times. interesting to learn some of the mechanisms of real world science","Although the class isn't difficult, its too time consuming due to the nature of HWs, Lecture, Pre - labs, Labs, quizzes, and project. Instead of a three - hour class it feels like 4 hours.","It is very time consuming and you must go to class but there is no final and options for retakes which helps a lot","I like how the professor encourages questions and work collaboration.","This class can start off as difficult, but once you start a routine that works for you it gets easy. \n","it's pretty easy as long as u go to lecture","It was fine.

I was nervous to take a college level chemistry course buy so far have felt engaged, interested, and content with her teaching style for this class.","This course is very helpful in understanding fundamental processes / concepts in chemistry. The Professor and her TA's provide adequate resources to help you succeed in the course, and if I could recommend a professor for this class, I would say take it with Dr. [Removed]!","This course is very rigorous and will require you to work on it every day. The homework assignments can be difficult and I encourage you to go to office hours and ask for help.","  This course is a great course to take for introduction to physics. The teacher and teaching assistants are very good at trying to ensure everyone learns the material adequately. \n","I describe it as a managable course that requires a lot of extra time outside of lectures to be successful, and it is a priority.","It's an intro course, so don't get scared and take it if you want. Also, the professor for this class explains the stuff really well.","This course requires effort but is fair and taught well \n","Entry level chemistry course needed for upper level classes and science degrees.","I would describe this class as a great class to fulfill a degree requirement. The professor is very understanding and cares about her students.","[Removed] is a general chemistry course that goes into deep detail on chemistry, including quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.","Very [Removed] to understand course. [Removed] [Removed] with a lot of points back oppurtunities","Very in depth and conceptual.","Not a difficult class, but not a class you can brush off either. Some level of effort is needed.","This class is a lot of practice and conceptual understanding.","It's a beginner course handling technical lab things but incorporating real - world biology instead of textbook material","It's an easy a on the basics of chem","In order to do well in genetic, you would need to have a good understanding of probability and how genes are passed down from parent to offsprings.","A lot of memorization is involved, but if you put in the work, you will be capable of understanding.","The course is challenging but the retests allow room for learning and improvement.","It is a relatively simple biology core class, but it can get tedious with the amount of memorization you have to do. There is no real application - based learning."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>instructor_id<\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.course_description<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"instructor_id","targets":1},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":2},{"name":"or.course_description","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

love Professor [Removed]! She reminds me of a mother figure because she is just so caring towards all her students. I also love the classroom textbook we are currently using... it is very helpful for the class. Dr. [Removed] provides countless resources for all her students and much flexibility within her course. \n\n  Sometimes, however, I have a difficult time comprehending the lectures(not because of the professor ), simply because I am a slower learner. I will sometimes compare myself to my classmates and wonder why am I not able to keep up with them. The [Removed] can be difficult for me to understand, so I sometimes just go with what answers my friends pick. But that's okay, I know that this is just part of my learning how to study in college. In AP [Removed], I only relied on memorization. In this class, there is a much higher need to understand, and I am still working to adapt to that. \n\n I'm hoping that in the future, Dr. [Removed] could make attending class optional. I feel a high level of responsibility to attend all my classes ; however, in genetics, I struggle to comprehend the lectures. What I prefer to do is self - study the textbook, attempt the problems on my own, and then watch the recorded lecture. I feel that the class lecture makes me more overwhelmed since I know that I won't be able to understand it so clearly. However, I am currently working on a new method of reading the textbook chapters before class so that I can continue to go to lectures. We'll see what works better! :) \n\n That is my input for the class itself ; Professor [Removed] is perfect, and I wouldn't change anything about her!","She is an amazing instructor who keeps students involved and makes learning fun. She encourages students to give it their all and always ask questions if needed. She has no problem going back to review or repeat information and provides an enormous amount of support to ensure that all students feel comfortable in the course.","So far, the class is rolling pretty smoothly and I have enjoyed it. I do not think there is anything I would change, even if there are a lot of assignments.","I liked that my instructor did an introductory note card assignment for participation points and I also like that he has the opportunity for us to redo exam questions for half points back.","She is a great instructor overall.","The only thing that could be a little hard to deal with during his class is his accent but, outside of putting subtitles on the screen, I'm not sure if anything could be done to change this. He does have [Removed] videos which feature the same lectures though, so that's also a potential resource for people who can't understand most of his lectures. Also, we can always just ask him or the TAs questions after class, so that helps too.","Dr. [Removed] is a wonderful professor, and I really feel supported in the course.","Na, I really enjoy Dr. [Removed]'s class","no she's a good professor and she's always positive that the class will do well.","He is a great teacher","There should be more background before jumping straight into college chemistry. Maybe the first week can serve as a review of the chemistry readiness modules.","The professor reviews important topics, and puts links to slides and information in the canvas for those who want extra studying but don't have time during the day for tutoring or office hours.","Dr. [Removed] is very friendly and open to discussion, which is something that I think helps the students feel comfortable in his classroom and have more of an openness to learn.","She is encouraging and ensures that we know she truly cares for our success.","The class is sufficient, more collaboration and more examples during class would help with understanding the topics.","Just that she is very strict and detail oriented with grading and although I see her reasoning, the amount of coursework for a lab and my other 4 classes is a lot and the smallest of mistakes does not seem fair to take off such large sums off of the grades","I think she's great","He seems to be a very sweet genuine man who wants success for his students. He sometimes emphasizes things that are not of importance which makes the course a little confusing but does give an adequate amount of material to study and for the most part explains everything in class.","Throughout [Removed] School, [Removed] was something I struggled with. Going into [Removed] now, I was very nervous. However, Dr. [Removed]'s is an incredible professor, and she has helped me understand [Removed] on a level I previously deemed impossible.","I asked her a question once at the beginning of class and she answered very passive aggressively. The question was literally about a medical issue I was having and she told me “ You know my ta's are happy to answer any questions. ” I did not think I should have told them and she answered with such rudeness. Also, her slideshows are very messy and she is not a good teacher in general. Everyone I have talked to who has her has a complaint about her.","I think everyone in this class loves [Removed]. She's a great instructor and our [Removed], [Removed] is very knowledgeable and nice. They make it very easy to listen to them and trust them.","Nothing at all so far, liking the class!","Nope! I really appreciate Dr. [Removed] and all that he contributes to his class.","I like the structure of the course, the expectations are clear and the exams are designed well in a way that makes it easy to do well as long as you put in the work.","caudill is great.","Not at the moment","I enjoy this course, but it is a hard course.","I really love how Dr. [Removed] arrange the course material per unit. It is very neat and reachable. So, its easier for us to study.","I feel like if you had a background in physics already, this class would be easier to follow.","She will ask the TA's to NOT answer question while she lectures. Then why are they there!???","This professor has been the most understanding with students, she gives many opportunities to do better in her class and always cares about what people think. She always tries to improve as a professor and acts on it, instead of ignoring students' concerns. Best professor I have had so far in my undergrad years.","The instructor creates a very good learning environment, but I wish that he would assist more on preparing us for the test.","I really enjoy this course and the experiences I am gaining.","She's always been very supportive throughout the course and has provided even some practice from another professor who has also taught this course Mrs. [Removed], overall she's been great support and provided me with a push to continue working hard on all of my classes.","She is greattttttt!!","She is extremely caring and encourages me to learn. I feel she is very approachable, and that makes for a much better learning environment than if she weren't. She clearly explains concepts and checks for understanding. She is patient and kind and fosters a very healthy, inclusive, supportive learning setting.","My TA is extremely understanding of all issues and composes herself in a way that is commendable. I have nothing but positive thoughts about her and she does an amazing job.","The instructor is very supportive and does not judge if we don't understand a concept, which is important to my learning experience.","I enjoy how much he cares how the students are actually doing.","The professor did some experiments in the first week of class that were really interesting. I think they should be a constant part in most lectures.","Prof [Removed] has been great so far, and her class is very organized. I love how she explains the concepts we go over in class, making them seem much for simple. She is also very approachable!","No I do not have anything else to share.","The questions on the weekly quizzes are worded really confusingly.","just haven't seen it myself personally","Dr. [Removed] is really nice and you can tell she cares about us! She provides us with many resources to help our studies and is always willing to help.","I like Professor [Removed] a lot.","Sawyer is just a really great personality and brings a sort of comfort to the lab setting, doesn't feel like she is talking down to us or is better than us in any way, and this makes for a more inclusive learning environment.","No, not necessarily.","The videos are recorded so that reviews are easy to do, and he pays attention to the class, enforcing students to pay attention or else they might miss out on key details.","She has been very sweet, understanding, approachable and made my first lab less underwhelming. I also had to miss many labs due to illness and she was understanding and made the experience very low stress.","No, she skips over some material and doesn't time manage lecture well sometimes and focuses on easier concepts then leaves us to figure out the harder concepts on our own.","Sometimes the content is covered too quickly but the resources make it easier to cover outside of class.","I really like Dr. [Removed]. She honestly makes learning chemistry enjoyable for me, she goes fast but not to the point where you get lost if you looked through the material before class. She is patient and kind, and I'm thinking of becoming a [Removed] because of her class.","Even though I overlooked the focus on learning objectives at first, when it came time to studying for the test, this was a very useful criteria to look for in my exam preparation and helped me adequately realize what concepts I needed to spend more time with.","I think the ability to do test corrections and get points back on exams is extremely beneficial to my experience in the course. I feel it allows me to stress less and it also ensures I learn the material.","Something that I appreciate is that our professor understands our situation as a student. In the syllabus and on the first day of class setting expectations, she mentioned how she values progress over perfection. This was really important to me because it can be hard to aim for perfection especially at a higher education level. However, with the help of others that this course provides I feel more open to learning and not closed off. It's okay to make mistakes and it's valuable to learn what learning styles / studying techniques are the most beneficial to you. As I go into college, I have learned a lot about myself and this course has made me feel more comfortable in adapting to the change.","I always feel great and relaxed when an instructor reminds me that I can always get in contact with them for help because I don't feel as overwhelmed by the course.","The demonstrations and examples given in lecture are beneficial in helping me to connect the ideas and concepts that are taught in lecture to a real life experience. Furthermore, the questions given in lecture are challenging, yet provoke thought and allow me to reinforce the concepts that are being introduced","Dr. [Removed] is very kind and a good listener. He works hard to make sure his students do not fall behind and are actually understanding the material, rather than just memorizing it.","He's very welcoming in office hours","I liked my instructor, but I didn't pay that much to details or to everything they said. I don't remember enough to meaningfully answer some of the questions.","I think I am pretty struggling for biology course. I need more time to focus on the academic performance and I will ask some methods to improve my performance.","I absolutely love this class. I don't take it very seriously on an academic standpoint, but this class has given me so much insight on material that is typically not showcased in my regular subjects. I would never have known how to navigate myself through registration if it wasn't for them.","She makes me feel hopeless. Genuinely like I have no chance in the class no matter how much I study or try.","I really love how the instructor seems like she loves the content she is teaching.","She's pretty great. \n","I think she should ignore student distractions and continue to give the lecture instead of pointing it out ( or threatening us that she will not provide the same information to us as she did in her other classes )   because it takes away from time that could be spent giving the lecture.","Dr. [Removed] is a funny and engaging lecturer, but the material we cover and quest practice is not sufficient to succeed at the level I am used to, even though I prepared thoroughly with the lecture notes and homework problems.","The instructor rarely shares about he rpersonal life or career which could help us feel closer to them and navigate our own career decisions","Yes. In the exam review on the exam day for midterm 1, a student asked a question about trophic efficiencies and rather than explain that huge point of confusion she laughed it off and said its rather simple. This had a strong negative feeling for me because not everyone is on her level of knowledge(obviously ) so if someone has a question she should approach it as if they know nothing rather than shrugging it off as simple.","She is just such a friendly and inspiring person and professor, I was scared to take this class but I have been doing amazing in this class and i have been LOVING physics because of her!!! I love the traditional lecture style and passionate teaching with the quiz questions to test our knowledge.","Overall, I think the way my instructor teaches is good. He explains the material fairly well. He seems like a professor that wants to help you, you just need to reach out.","I wish he would emphasize more in depth what we should review from the slides","She is a great professor! I am so glad I took this course with her. I would 10/10 recommend.","I really enjoy being in Dr. [Removed]'s class. She is really knowledgeable in the field of genetics, and I enjoy going to her classes every week.","No there is nothing additional \n","Not really - he's very good at his job and has one of the best teaching styles I've encountered in my past 3 years here.","He goes pretty fast in class so it really helps to pre read using the textbook.","Mrs. Hall recommended that we look at a [Removed] extension that would help with deadlines and reminders which speaks to what she has learned from having a daughter in college.","He always has a positive attitude which makes going to class enjoyable.","The instructor did a great job at teaching chem and being helpful.","I think this course is great with Loveridge, but I do understand that [Removed] in general is a very rigorous topic in general ; overall I do wish that the midterms were I bit more less challenging in the terms of the content of the midterm, such as the clock problem. But overall the current system is great for those taking engineering physics.","She is very kind and calming, and I can tell she truly cares about her students.","I think the instructor is doing a really good job in creating a comfortable learning environment for the students where people aren't afraid to make mistakes.","I think it will be great for the Lab and HW keys to be released after grading is finished to see our mistakes and what we could improve on as students.","I like how our professor solves some example problems during the lecture. It helps me understand the material more.","I think that [Removed] and [Removed] are both very good course instructors for this lab. They make the course fun, but they're both also very smart and organized, making nothing confusing and clearing up all misconceptions when they are asked. They're friendly people are good at their jobs, and this is my favorite lab course in [Removed] so far.","I really enjoy my instructor she is really attentive and is always welcoming to answer any questions or concerns we might have","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor who I can tell wants nothing but for his students to do well in his class. With that said, I think it is vital for him to see that the topics he covers in class I feel may be vague in terms of what he wants us to know for his exams. I feel as though what we cover in lecture is only the icing on the cake, and we therefore, learn material and equations outside of class that are not spoken about in lecture at all. Especially in a [Removed] I class where much of us have never been exposed to [Removed] before, this can be frustrating and difficult.","[Removed] makes us feel included and treats us like we are nothing below her.","I enjoy the instructor for ecology. I think she does a fine job at teaching a topic she is very involved in.","No, there's nothing else that I can think of to share.","I appreciate that Dr. [Removed] makes sure that all questions are answered and she spends time to make sure her students understand what she is teaching. I also like that her instapolls help quiz us on the content as we learn it. I do feel that her lecture style can be a little slow or inefficient at times, especially when she's picking someone to answer a question.","Dr. [Removed] is doing a wonderful job as a professor! I was intimidated to take physics in the beginning, but he makes it very approachable through engaging lectures and collaboration.","I think the tests need to be much more lenient- there's only 12 questions and no chance for partial credit","I really like the instructor, but outside of her lectures, it does not feel as though there are enough opportunities to learn the content or supplement knowledge","I like Dr. [Removed], but it is hard to connect with her one on one due to the size of the class. That is out of her control, though, so it is not a big complaint.","Dr. [Removed] provides extensions on assignments which has given me the time I needed to get my work done without rushing, this made the course a lot less stressful for me which is always appreciated. Overall her lecture is pretty good but sometimes she struggles to explain something clearly which can make getting a question answered difficult or confusing.","I like the class and teacher but the course organization leaves something to be desired. It is a very non - linear class with a lot of jumping around and finding different resources to learn things. I would prefer a more cohesive method ( like maybe a textbook?? ) rather than the curriculum which I feel relies on canvas too heavily and is disorganized for someone not already familiar with the material.","This is just a personal thing but I would prefer a better note system. Like how other professors handwrite them on a tablet. With just the slides, I get confused on what to write down as I don't have time to write all of it down and then I don't know what notes I need until the test.","The instructor can move a bit fast at times but overall good professor.","The professor made the class feel kind of stale at times, like it was just information on information without taking a second to tell a joke or ease the tension in the room. It felt like an hour and 15 minutes of information","I really enjoyed the positive energy and support the instructor brought to class.","I appreciate the professor being understanding of possible situations students are going through as well as offering numerous ways to study so that there is almost every type of option out there, ensuring everyone can study the best of their ability.","I like how Dr. [Removed] is open to answer as many questions she can in class, and after the class ends she always encourages people to come to her office hours if they need help.","The instructor seems kind and understanding of students and encouraging of student success in her course.","She is a great teacher.","No! Dr. [Removed] is great though. Very lucky to have her as my physics professor. Other professors should look up to her in terms of teaching methods and encouraging students.","I appreciate that the instructor is easy to approach, gives general life advice and seem to have the students' best interest at heart.","I think Professor [Removed] is an excellent professor. She is very approachable and kind and explains things very well.","Very good instructor especially considering I am going from high school physics to college level physics.","I think my professor this year is very helpful, understanding, and motivated which makes the class a lot easier to succeed in. She makes me feel encouraged so I can understand and complete my work which makes all the difference.","He's a great professor.","My instructors have been very nice and helpful. [Removed] also plays music in the background while we work. Her music taste is a little generic but I'm not complaining.","I feel that the questions from this survey do not accurately portray the expectations of a head TA in a [Removed] Lab.","Can we get more practice indicative of how the tests can be in class, and also more structured practices during discussion that doesn't seem so difficult, or has questions that build on each other to help develop a deeper understanding of the concept.","Professor [Removed] is an excellent professor. I really am enjoying her class.","I appreciate how he goes over problems with us to make sure we have a good understanding of all the concepts.","Dr. [Removed] is great!","Overall she has a very nice layout and structure to her course and it is easy to feel valued and encouraged always. She is very motivating and provides clear expectations of what is expected of us on any assignment or assesment.","professor [Removed] seems to really care about her students and encourages us to keep trying even when things feel hard, which is highly valued","I went to office house to ask about a missed question on a test and my professor explained and then praised me about my grade overall.","That one time Dr. [Removed] passed out cough drops to students who were coughing made me feel like he genuinely cares about his students' well being","I love my instructor he provides lots of info that we need that is going to be on the test","Dr. [Removed] is the only professor i've had at [Removed] who has opened up to her students and made herself vulnerable about her failures. She has shown me and my peers that it is okay to fail in physics because failing is what leads to success. She has spoken about her experiences as a women in STEM and I love that I am able to relate to her. Dr. [Removed] is such a valuable professor and I know I can learn a lot from her.","Sometimes it gets hard to follow her during lectures because she would explain a concept and suddenly bring in a different topic that we would learn about the next lecture day ; however, it's nice for her to give us a sneak peek of the next day's topic, it's just that because of the fast - paced nature of this class and the amount of new material we have to learn, it gets difficult to follow. \n\n Regardless of that, I like how she teaches the course material and I also greatly appreciate the practice problems that she does on the board since it makes it easier to understand the concept. Additionally, it's nice how she brings in material from past units to show how everything relates to one another.","He is very kind and approachable","I appreciate how the instructor makes tailored Unit Review guides on question types taught during class. Every other class, we have a quiz or exam in her class, also, and while some may think it bothersome to study often, it keeps me up to date and alert in the content knowledge. I do find it frustrating that there are only 5 questions on her quizzes as the penalty is brutal for making one minor mistake, but they are helpful in staying alert, and they are only about 6 % in the entire class average.","Dr. [Removed] is amazing and really encourages students to learn and be their best. Definitely take her if you can.","I like Dr. [Removed] and I think she is great about being fair to her students, I just wish that sometimes the class was a bit more engaging.","Dr. [Removed]'s use of [Removed] is honestly a mess and makes it incredibly difficult to stay organized. To begin, she posts student hours on the [Removed] calendar, so my calendar is cluttered with blocks for bio lab student hours instead of what I actually need. Other instructors use the calendar for assignment due dates, which is far more helpful, but Dr. [Removed]'s approach means I can't easily spot these deadlines that matter for my other classes. It's beyond frustrating, especially since there's no way to hide these events, making the calendar feel overwhelming and unusable. Student hours just need to be posted somewhere on the course's [Removed] page, like how all other instructors do it. On top of that, Dr. [Removed] floods our [Removed] inbox with messages that should just be posted on the course's announcement page. The inbox is for direct, important messages, not constant updates. Dr. [Removed] needs to understand how to use her [Removed] page efficiently and stop putting her course information in the most inconvenient and annoying ways possible.","I really like that there is an option to not have to ask questions out loud but rather through ed discussion, which makes it easier for me","I absolutely love how supportive the teaching team is, and how even outside of class they are so supportive. They send us weekly affirmations and tell us to take care of ourselves. The connection the teaching team makes to the students is far beyond what I've seen other teams do ; Dr. [Removed]'s team excels at it.","Dr. [Removed] is a very well rounded professor.","I think she's great but she moves too fast","No there is no extra information","The instructor took the time to go to each lab group and learn more about us and our mindsets about the class.","Not really, but he's good!","I think [Removed] is very knowledgable in his field. What he does that is very nice is he shared research opportunities, which is very important for people like me in pre - med that are looking for research opportunities.","I think she has done very well with trying to understand where the students are. She has also done well with explaining everything when someone is confused.","I think the instructor goes a little too fast, but I understand that this is supposed to be a fast - paced course.","Instructor is very encouraging and likes to make sure we are engaged during the lectures","i don't really like the structure of the class. It feels like I should be doing most of the new concept learning during the prelectures but I never feel like I have enough time so I end up just skimming until I come up with a question. Because the lectures are so heavily influenced by the prelectures, I end up being kind of lost and not feeling like I'm learning anything in class. I feel like I'm only learning when I'm doing the homeworks and have to go back through the textbook to figure out what's going on.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor and lecturer","Overall, Professor [Removed] has been one of my favorite professors at [Removed] [Removed] so far. She is down to earth and seems to genuinely want to help us as much as she can. She also treats us all with mutual respect and even cracks jokes every now and then which lightens the mood a lot. This makes all the difference with such a rigorous class.","Sometimes the professor can be a little unclear on expectations when asking us to do questions on our own. I think it would be helpful for her to sometimes nudge us in the right direction before giving us time to work on it. Overall though, professor [Removed] is very approachable and kind.","Overall, [Removed] has been INSTRUMENTAL in my success in this course. She provided the course content in ways that were manageable and easy to digest.","nope. He is doing great","I did everything in this class that I was supposed to do before the exam. I had done all the textbook readings, re - did the homework problems three times, redid the practice exam twice, went to multiple office hours sessions, and reached out to other friends in the class. I had fully felt as though I understood the class content. However, after the exam I was disappointed with my grade despite the fact that I tried my best and the questions of the exam were significantly difficult, which we had not encountered in class or in the practice before.","She's a great instructor and her class is really enjoyable.","Love her. Took her for [Removed] for [Removed] and she is the best. [Removed] on my top 5 profs at [Removed].","The instructor consistently offers advice on class topics and provides many examples. Additionally, the instructor does not leave the students to fend for themselves over questions, instead they lead us through them and toward the correct answer without explicitly saying the answer.","I think that it could help to respond to more questions that students ask online ( such as in [Removed] ) during the lecture period. However, I understand that there is limited time to work with.","I really enjoy when professors do practice problems from the homework.","Dr. [Removed] made class feel like a very constructive and friendly environment while encouraging participation.","Posting learning modules the night before a lecture is a bit stressful, as it does not give me enough time to complete material that is significant to understanding the lecture the next day","Prof. [Removed] is a good physics teacher","Not that I can think of.","I would like to say that sometimes Dr. [Removed] has a judgemental tone when students answer a question wrong. I don't think she means to do this, but it is sometimes discouraging.","My instructor has offered a lot of materials for preparing for exams which is very helpful.","i love the way the new chemistry classes have been formatted.","The professor redirected us to the [Removed] health center and advised therapy. The professor did not appear to be able to help students individually outside of academics.","No they are all very good.","The professor often goes very quickly through the material and gauges the understanding of students on a topic through the understanding of the overall group. This in my situation at least is not over all inclusive of my learning experience as I often feel behind my class / groupmates. Furthermore, I wish she would record the lectures. I know she does the mini - videos in the modules that cover most of the material covered in class, but having the actual in class lectures would help. Often times important information about the topic we're discussing in the class comes organically from the professor and is at times not emphasized when it really should be in the mini - videos like it is in class.","I enjoy that we have opportunities to retake two exams and that some quizzes and insta polls are dropped. Originally, I was nervous about taking this class since, I am not very good at chemistry but Dr. [Removed] has been able to provide a smooth transition from high school to college level chem that has relieved some of my stress and worries.","I would love to be able to take actual notes during class because I do not understand anything we are doing or any of the content, and I would like to have actual notes to look at for the class.","All assignments should be posted to [Removed] in advance. It is frustrating when the pre - labs are hidden on [Removed], and all the posted assignments don't even have the included link to complete the assignment ( ethics board ).","The instructor is wonderful at explaining the course material and how to apply them to real life problems.","I love the fact that we get groups for class to discuss assignments. They're very helpful when answering questions.","she's a great teacher","She is amazing, love her teaching style","I think his lectures are too fast paced to retain enough information. However, the TA led discussions are helpful.","I reccomend taking more questions out of the textbook and explaining what sections would be most useful for the next lecture so students can get another chance to understand the material. Besides that, it's good to always encourage discussion and have students answer each other's question so they can flex their knowledge regarding the question or subject.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor and truly emphasizes learning and a growth mindset over grades. She is more than willing to help her students and is genuinely eager to meet each and every one of us. At times, there are some parts of lecture that I may not understand but with the help of [Removed] and the many resources provided to us, I am able to gain clarity on the material.","I believe Dr. [Removed] truly does care about his students and their learning experiences which I do feel whenever I go to his lectures.","I really appreciate how encouraging and nonjudgmental she is when helping us with the content.","It frustrates me that the slides in the lecture materials are not the same slides you show during the lecture- I know it is not all that important but I would like every piece of information I can get.","She is one of the best teacher's I've had since coming to [Removed]. She genuinely enjoys what she is doing and she loves her students.","I love the instructor and the TA! They are amazing people!","I didn't like the midterm exam we were given that had so few questions. It placed a lot of pressure on us to get the right answer because there was little room for error. The professor said it's okay to make mistakes, but when a couple mistakes cost you a whole letter grade, it feels like I can't make mistakes.","I would just say that we have access to the lecture before the lecture.","I like the instructors approach to portraying material, especially with providing examples as a lot of professors in the department don't do that which leaves students lost on homework a lot of the time.","I believe that the professor is great. She cares about her students and is always available to answer questions.","Our instructor did not have time to answer or make sure we understood the material before we move on. I have to teach myself over and over again to make sure I don't fail the class","I find the retake policy on midterms very effective for these reasons. 1 ) Helps reduce test anxiety : having a second chance makes you feel less nervous and anxious about the test. 2 ) Gives you room to improve : after knowing your first test's grades, you can feel motivated to study harder for the second test. 3 ) Avoid unfortunate surprises/ bad luck : Even if something pops up on the test that you weren't expecting or if all the questions were about your weakest topic, you have a second chnace to reinforce that topic and do well.","Whenever we made errors, she would always help us through it and made sure we did not feel bad. She helped to correct our errors and explained to us how we can prevent them in the future.","Dr. [Removed] is really helpful with office hours and making sure students get the help we may need.","No, I will keep it to myself","She is welcoming to us in the sense she encourages us to talk to her about any issues with the class during her office hours and provides coffee and cookies.","The instructor is cool and very down to [Removed].","Nothing I can think of at the moment","There is way too much unnecessary work. This lab takes up more time than some of my engineering courses just because of the random assignments that I don't believe have even impacted me or taught me anything.","It is my opinion that Dr. [Removed] has spent too much time trying to shush students in class when they are speaking while they are not supposed to be. I agree with her in that their whispering and sometimes complete just talking is distracting, but I also think that as a professor she should of all people be able to tune it out to focus on the lesson. She has said that my class ( 11 - 12:15 ) has missed out on multiple insights for the tests that the other 2 classes have recieved because she spends so much time having to stop and ask people to quiet down. I can appreciate the first couple of times, but she has easily made the comment 10 + times a lecture and I find myself frustrated not only with the people talking, but her for bringing it up so often instead of going through the lecture. I am fully aware that talking is incredibly disrespectful to her and the rest of the students, but I'd like to say again that in my opinion she needs to spend less time focusing so much on it to just continue teaching so that the rest of us can learn as best as possible.","Dr. [Removed] makes class really fun. Love her demos","No I think I said everything, she's a great professor and really knows how to teach difficult topics in a manner that's easily interpreted.","Dr. [Removed] is awesome and, by far, one of my favorite Professors on the 40 acres. TA [Removed] is also super helpful. He often explains things to me a second or third time to reinforce it.","She is a very nice professor, and although she is sometimes very pushy about people participating during class ( I am too nervous to do so ), I appreciate her effort in having a more interactive class.","She is very welcoming and makes a notoriously difficult course seem more doable, so I really appreciate the efforts she puts in doing that.","does not know how to teach, scribbles on slides. 600 students confused without an idea of what s going on.","Professor [Removed] genuinely cares about her students and this is very evident in class every day","I like how nice he is. It makes the class less intimidating and have a more positive vibe.","She is a good teacher but her writing isn't legible.","The instructor is really kind. I just feel like I'd leave lectures feeling confident about the material and then see the homework and be completely confused.","nothing comes to mind at the moment.","The pace of the units that we've covered has been very unbalanced. It felt like we had an abundance of time for our first unit, but our second unit feels rushed.","I might be mistaken, but in the instructor's syllabus, it doesn't seem like he added information concerning mental health, but this does not mean that he does not support the aid thereof.","It's not exactly an issue because we don't have exams in the course.","Even though there are so many people in the class, Dr. [Removed] tries her best to make sure every student gets the help they need.","huge class so I don't blame Dr. [Removed] for not being able to check in with every student","The way he carries the class being able to joke with us but also keep it serious when needed. I also really like the ice breakers and activities we do to get the students active and get to know one another.","Her classes are very good and have a good pace, in the sense that they are not to fast neither monotonous. I'd recommend her to anyone interested in the course.","I love that Professor [Removed] gives half the points back on the exams. It helps me stay calm and less anxious when I take the exams, which ultimately makes me do better. I also think it establishes that students are more than just their test scores and builds a healthy relationship with learning. I think this shows how Professor [Removed] cares about the well - being of his students.","I really like how many resources are available to her students and how she always makes sure there is a way students can personalize their studying based on what is most challenging to them. The question types, review and lecture slides, and practice problems / exam are very helpful.","The instructor talked about how he has visited 48 of the 50 states and that he loved traveling, which was nice to know because it allowed us as students to relate to him more and it was a warmer welcome to the course.","No! I think [Removed] is super nice. I wish he did provide more materials that reflected the exams.","dr [Removed] hasn't done much","Discussion sections would be better for reviewing the material more.","I really like this class. I think the professor is great. I do know that sometimes the energy in the class is low because the class is at 9:30 am and a lot of kids are tired. I do like how the professor still tires to interact with the class and keep the energy levels up despite the circumstances.","Nothing else, she has done a great job and I'm happy with her class.","The instructor is very friendly, positive, personable, and understanding. Her courses focus on being able to apply data science and work through inevitable roadblocks. I enjoyed a past course so much that I chose to take her class for data science as well.","I think my professor really does care about his students and consistently encourages for us to visit office hours for help.","Overall, Dr. [Removed] has done a profound job thoroughly explaining certain hard - to - comprehend subjects and has provided adequate material in order to promote the overall success of her students.","He made sure there were lots of options we could take to study the material.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor and she makes this course very interesting even though it is a challenging course.","I don't really like her lecture style(as do many other students I have talked with ) so I struggle to focus during class. I end up learning a lot of the material on my own time.","i love learning from [Removed] [Removed]. She is so friendly and so very easy to understand. She is also very encouraging.","I really enjoy the flipped classroom style because I feel like when I do the homework before class I come into class knowing more and the concepts click better for me.","I like the course overall, but I'm not a fan of how each exam only has about 12 questions as this doesn't really give much room for any error. Even if a student knows the material but simply gets 2 questions wrong that immediately puts them at a low B, which I don't think is fair.","My TA is really great and does a great job with what she can control. I know a lot of the course layout is not up to her, but the professor. I know that my TA cares about us doing well and learning. She also values our time, while also making sure we have a strong understanding of the experiments.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor!","The instructor simply never talked about that sort of positivity.","No, thank you for teaching us!","She is a very nice instructor who encourages group work and hands - on learning!","No, that will be all.","No other information.","She's very uplifting and asks students to talk to her if there are any issues and how she's willing to do what she can to help and support us. It honestly was refreshing to hear that since there are a lot of professors that don't particularly care about most situations, so it was a welcoming difference.","She tends to skip through material since she doesn't explain it fast enough.","I think this class if very interesting and thorough, but sometimes there is too much work that doesn't seem necessary. For example, some of the research reports and prelabs I think take up too much time and have us spend that time on something that isn't as important or useful to what we're doing. It's also a lot of work for a 2 credit course.","she is a really good in teaching and provide us with insides on how to do well on the test. i am really happy to be her student","She is very engaging and approachable.","There is nothing else I would like to share.","I have been to one of Dr. [Removed]'s student hours so far, and in this student hour, she asked us how we were doing mentally and if we are keeping up with the material. Dr. [Removed] always prioritizes her students' mental health before anything which I greatly appreciate.","Extra help sessions and support for those confused on class","not really, they're super supportive and amazing","Our instructor has been nothing but nice and sweet to each individual student within the class. I would 100 percent retake this class because the class was very interesting and the instructor and student assistant was easy to work with and get along.","The instructor is kind and inclusive but I feel like I mainly get help from office hours or peers when I'm having trouble understanding the material","Keep up the good work and try not to let the whispering get to you too much since it distracts from class, I say that understanding the irony","No there is nothing else.","I think the professor is great! The hardest aspect of the class has to do with how the lab is run. The lab expects a lot of prior knowledge that we haven't covered yet in class. Thus I often feel very confused and don't understand what we are doing in the lab because it is dealing with concepts we haven't talked about yet in class.","The learning modules in the class are helpful, but sometimes when instructor goes over the topic in lecture, she makes it confusing when it wasn't before.","He provides a lot of extra credit which I feel helps most of the students.","The class moves really fast, but the professor is really nice","Not at the moment. \n","Professor [Removed] took some time at the end of a class to talk about how some of us may feel that we don't belong at [Removed], but that nobody is perfect at everything the first time they try it, and that we are all at [Removed] for a reason. I thought that was very kind and helpful.","I appreciate how she handled my accommodations through [Removed], i have a hard time talking to professors about it and she treated it very kindly but still casual. When talking to professors about accommodations, my two worst case scenarios are if they don't care / don't believe I need my accommodations or if they are overly accommodating and treat it like a big deal. She was very kind without making our conversation a bigger deal than it needed to be.","She is a great professor, I don't blame her for anything she does because it is a lecture hall with 400 students, it's impossible to please everybody.","Super considerate and genuinely cares about your learning and overall wellbeing inside and outside of class.","I think the instructor is fair and cares about students' understanding of the material. I would recommend this course to others.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor! The Learning Modules are extremely helpful to complete before class, primarily because it's easier to understand as she goes more in - depth in the topic. I enjoy all of the resources she provides for her students in regards to exam preparation.","[Removed] professor. STEM classes are hard [Removed] they are mostly exam based and I am a horrendous exam taker, but i enjoy physics and Dr. [Removed] is my top prof for any of the STEM classes I've taken that I am not remotely confident in.","I think [Removed] makes the class very welcoming for everyone and I feel safe being able to share my thoughts and opinions.","She is very thoughtful","The professor feels very distant to students. TA's lead most or all outside of lecture activities. I don't know how to connect to her.","I greatly appreciate the amount that the professor offers extra credit opportunities to students.","I really like that the instructor is extremely clear when clarifying any misunderstandings about a question or concept that I do not understand.","I really liked that at the very beginning of the first couple classes, Dr. [Removed] asked us fun questions as ice breakers to talk about with our neighbor, which made it less awkward to talk to them about the material when prompted later in class.","[Removed] is a wonderful instructor and she creates a welcoming environment for her students. I wish there were more practice worksheets with answers available. She's usually very engaged with her student but the 3 pm class has me [Removed]","Dr [Removed] is super nice and sweet as a professor but his course is super challenging","I am not the biggest fan of [Removed] - I think it is just people saying things in a \" void \". I understand that we have an ethics flag but there has to be a better way. Honestly it feels like an echo chamber, and it is without any nuance. Also, it's like 500 people so if there is a strong chance someone has already said what you want to say.","I really like how the instructor has office hours that allow me to get additional help that I need. When I went, there were few students, and she would come to me making sure that I had all my questions answered. She would also frequently check up on me to ensure I was on the right track. I really appreciated how helpful she was.","He's great, just wish the homework's and test were more in line with the questions he asks in class","She is extremely flexible and makes me feel comfortable in class even though physics is out of my comfort zone.","No, that is all.","No information at the moment.","We barely get any time to discuss topics among classmates in class and not a lot of time is spent going into depth on the materials. The class feels fast - paced. In order to properly prepare for class and learn the topics, I have to consult outside materials. Only then, am I able to see / understand the steps that go into solving a problem.","No! In regards to the last question, it didn't have an impact on my course experience because I knew my neighbors from high school. Overall, Dr. [Removed] has been a fine teacher.","Having discussion sessions in the evening is quite taxing in my opinion and I would prefer a discussion during the day but it seems for many physics and math related classes at this university, they are all in the evening which is fine for people who live on or near campus but as a commuter it is quite the extra effort to add to my commute at the end of the day.","I like my instructor!","I think Dr. [Removed] really cares about her students and their success in her class, and I think that I would love an opportunity to take her class again.","I appreciate the instructor's ability to balance lectures and student collaboration into class. I also think that the lectures are engaging.","As a member of the dyslexic community vocationally I can not understand a word he is saying","The instructor made it clear at the beginning of the course that if any accommodations were needed to alert her through the routes given by the university, and to talk to her if further discussion over the accommodations was necessary.","She moves on too quickly sometimes especially on harder topics, which I understand having to move on to get work done but we don't even get to learn. I'm not the only one, I've literally sat next to people I don't know and they say the same things.","No, but she is very welcoming and allows many opportunities for collaboration.","Dr. [Removed] is very kind and welcoming which I appreciate because college can sometimes be stressful and having a kind and understanding professor can make or break your experience. He makes learning engaging and fun. I really enjoy having him as my teacher this semester.","Nothing in mind.","I do not believe so.","I liked [Removed], my TA, very much and she's been very helpful. However, I do not retain much from Dr. [Removed]'s lectures since he goes too fast, has vague slides, little resources, and does not answer emails.","Dr sata is super excited about the work that he has done but I don't love how we start a new chapter before the exam on the last unit has been done","She is very comforting and makes the class seem less daunting. I tried to take intro to chemistry last year but I did not do well on my exams so I had to drop out of that class. This time, I am definitely understanding the material and doing better on exams.","I really enjoy the class and think everything is set perfect. I do have one critique though. I believe the discussion sections - outside of taking quizzes - are kind of a waste of time at the moment. When asked about homework, from what I've noticed, not much work is done, and people mostly only show up for the quizzes or sometimes the extra credit opportunities. To benefit students, something that my [Removed] class actually does is during [Removed], we are given a handout - practice problems - that we first do as a class ( independently or in pairs ) and then discuss as a whole - with the TA. This gives some more practice and I feel as if its better than just opening it for HW in general, as I feel like we have enough TA's and drop - in hours that going over HW during Discussion [Removed] is quite unecessary.","He a great professor.","Sometimes she is extremely fast paced and doesn't thoroughly explain some topics, assuming you already know it. While the information is on the learning modules, my biology class is set up the same way and my professor thoroughly explains things as if we haven't taken biology since high school ( which is true for both bio and chem ). I wish that sometimes she would ensuring she has time to cover all topics equally in class ( Typically rushing in the last 15 minutes ) Overall a good class that requires work, but it's obtainable to succeed.","Since it is a physics class, there are various “ theoretical ” concepts that can be hard to understand on paper. At the first day of the course, Dr. [Removed] used an inclined plane with two figures(I think one was a sphere, and one was kind of two cones with bases attached together ) and showed how one rolled down while one went up, looking like it is going against gravity. He also had a wheel and rotated it held vertically, which didn't fall horizontally but stayed in its vertical position. This was very interesting to me personally and made me want to learn about the topics to see how those models are affected by it. \n I also really like that he is using actual physical models to demonstrate what we are going over. It is good to understand the concept and realize things that might not be so obvious, since most physical concepts are kind of “ invisible ” in bare eyes, which makes it a bit unintuitive I think.","He's been doing a fantastic job on creating a welcoming environment.","The chosen questions for our quiz were very difficult compared to the other lab sections. I think that there should be a fair set of questions for each lab with equal difficulty for each.","Dr. [Removed] is a very laid back professor in a way where he provides a calm learning environment during class. That allows to not feel stressed out during class and comfortable when I do not understand something the first time it is taught to me. His TAs are always engaged during class and he always encourages group collaboration and full class participation when learning new topics.","The test was very challenging overall. Many student failed","I've enjoyed this course so far, because prof. [Removed] makes the lectures interesting. I especially like that the lectures and instapolls really emphasize core concepts.","Very great professor and very helpful and knowledgeable","The instructor is a very good one and I like how there is so much material that is given to us for us to use.","No, there was nothin else","I think the professor is doing a great job so far and the course is going well.","I like the assignments Dr. [Removed] gives us in class. I find them very helpful to make sure that I understand the material and see what I have to study later.","She is an awesome professor and very vulnerable which is so important to see as a college student","When discussing questions about exams she is not as accommodating. Some questions I believe were unfair or not necessarily taught which I thought was not helpful or an accurate measure of mastering the content.","I really like how the professor always comes to class with a positive attitude and a clear excitement to discuss the topics.","She's always talking about whispering. Like we are in a giant lecture hall you can't expect to hear a pen drop. Honestly, sometimes I don't even here these whispers. I'm not saying it's an auditory hallucination, but maybe there's a disconnect in what's being heard and understanding of what it is.","Dr. [Removed] is a genuine and kind professor who wants to see his students succeed. He is helpful and actively gets students to participate in class, which is important in cultivating growth.","The resources he provides us with before exams are helpful. He tells us what concepts we need to know.","Dr. [Removed] is just a very caring person in general. I have had professors that don't even pretend to care, professors that say they care but don't actually care, and professors who I genuinely believe had a sadistic personality disorder. Dr. [Removed]'s class is the first time I truly felt welcome and cared about. This is a really hard balance to strike because your professor is ultimately the one responsible for your grades and, by extension, your future, so there is naturally a lot of room for conflict. Maybe it's just that Dr. [Removed]'s personality is uniquely caring, but even when I don't do as well as I wish I had in the course, I still feel like I can speak to her or the TAs and get help, and that they will go out of their way to help me because they really want to see me learn. Overall a very good experience, I don't even like genetics but I really enjoyed this course!","I wish the instructors were more active on [Removed] [Removed] I feel like I would post my homework questions there if I knew it would get responded to in a couple hours, but I understand Dr. [Removed] and the TAs have other classes, research, and personal lives and can't constantly tend to [Removed] discussion. It's just really frustrating to go approach a homework problem 4 different ways and it still be wrong and not know what to do.","I think so far in my academic journey, Professor [Removed] course policies are the best. There are few difficult things for me that I would like to be addressed. For example, I'm a commuter student. I drive from 1hr everyday to get to campus. I wish If there was way for me to still participate in the class without having to show up to campus every day because frankly its very tiring to drive every day for an hour to get to campus. Perhaps lectures online or online zoom availability for commuting students can be a great thing.","No, honestly our TA is very kind and wants us all to succeed. She is very approachable and extremely thorough with her instructions / expectations.","I feel comfortable bringing up questions / concerns I have with her. I appreciate that it feels like a casual interaction with no judgement.","Dr. [Removed] is a special physics professor in that he doesn't teach over your head. Oftentimes it's been my and my peers' experience that physics teachers &amp; professors teach their classes as if they assume the class has already seen some or all of the material, and thus they blaze through the topics without stopping to think about how their students are responding or learning -- in other words, they teach right over their students' heads. I really appreciate that Dr. [Removed] understands who he's teaching and what background knowledge they do and don't already have, and adjusts his teaching style and pace accordingly. It makes the class much less stressful and more enjoyable.","The professor is very quick to respond to student concerns and if the issue involves a large portion of the class she will take a few minutes at the beginning of class to mention the issue and resolve it if she has already found the solution. If she does not have an immediate solution, she keeps students updated until she has one.","I appreciate how there are several resources available to study and review before exams. I also appreciate the office hours and academic communities hosted throughout the week.","Yes, Dr. [Removed] is a very upbeat type of person who brings energy into her lectures. She keeps the people in her lectures involved by constantly having us talk to each other about problems that are on the screen.","The class itself is very challenging and I am doing much better than I thought that I would have been, but the class is extremely fast paced and I feel that I am falling behind no matter what. We only had five classes between exam 1 and exam 2, which is hard for me to understand what I had gotten wrong in the last exam and prepare for the next upcoming one. So there is a sense of being overwhelmed in that class.","I appreciate his straight - forward approach to problem - solving, he also seems to genuinely support students and respect their feedback","I like that she is very engaged in teaching. She never goes off topic.","I dislike how she uploads different slides from the ones in the actual in - person lecture. In the modules on canvas, there are slides missing or that she does not show to us so it's hard for me to know how she got to a conclusion.","I think one of the most beneficial things that the professor does for us is that she makes a list of the question types that will be on the exams. This gives us a clear, cut - out overview of what to expect and tells us exactly how to study which helps maximize my time and what the most important concepts are to review.","The pre - labs are unnecessarily long and not relevant to being successful in lab. [Removed] is not very relevant to the course either. The reports are very helpful in organizing material for our posters.","I think she is a great instructor, she tries to turn a difficult class into a fun one, and does a good job. It is challenging, but she is a good lecturer and she is funny, so the class is still fun even though it is difficult.","Love her, she is very nice","The instructor is really nice and she is always offering opportunities to help your grade and do well on your assignments.","Dr. [Removed] seems to genuinely care about students.   It does become slightly frustrating that it feels like the end of our class time is rushed because of time / classroom management.","I like how the class is structured around self learning, and the lectures are more a summary then they are new learning. This allows me to work at my own pace and form my own understanding of the material before the lecture, then test it during lecture.","He genuinely shows how much he likes physics in class and always listens to his students","Not that I can think of. She seems like a good instructor and I appreciate her!","A lot of information is presented quickly, in a small amount of time, and the study resources aren't very helpful for me to perform well in the exams.","I have definitely found this course to be extremely difficult, especially when it comes to applying what we've learned in class to the homework assignments and the exams. I have found that we barely scratch the surface of a topic in class, but are expected to know way more about it to answer homework questions. I think Professor [Removed] is such a kind person and truly cares about her students, but I am struggling with this aspect of the class.","This instructor takes a lot of time and care to thoroughly answer students' questions. On multiple occasions, he has looked into things between lectures in order to elaborate and better answer a question from the previous lecture. I think this is very helpful and makes the instructor very approachable.","He is very good at keeping the class engaged and he plays videos from space and does example problems like what we saw in the videos ( he did his PhD on physics of the moon )","I like that Professor [Removed] is really enthusiastic about this field of physics, it also helps that she's pretty funny ; she's often cracking jokes that make the whole lecture hall giggle, and I think it helps lighten up the mood and helps the space feel more humane, I suppose. This is unlike other physics classes, where the professor is painfully serious all the time, which makes the class that much harder.","Well there really good preofessors","She is very caring and knowledgeable. She cares about students and wants them to succeed in her class. She's happy to answer the questions that we may still have after class, and she emphasizes the growth mindset and discussion with peers to talk about the problems before going over in class together.","no there is not","This instructor wants to see her students succeed, and makes sure they have every resource necessary, from question types and study materials to complete reviews and prerequisite information. Anything that a student needs is accessible to them, and there are several TAs ready to answer questions. The overall environment to this course, even with over 1300 people enrolled, is comfortable and success oriented.","No, other than mentioning the feedback surveys for extra credit, she rarely talks about anything other than the lecture material and her own experience in the field of chemistry.","The professor recognizes the challenges of the college student life, reminds us of important things like   sleeping and eating, and teaches in a way that isn't too fast - paced. He also allows us to talk with our classmates, so that it is a more comfortable and fun environment.","this professor is great and in tune with students","Sawyer is a great person who is very relatable and easy to talk to. She really cares about us and our projects, and she is willing to help no matter how long it takes. She is very knowledgeable in the course and has no issue helping us out at any point.","She is a great professor.","For the last four questions, this is a science class.   Other than talking about who did what, we can not really go into that much detail.   I think he does a really good job teaching us what we need to know for our future classes.","Prof. [Removed] is excellent! Very organized course and teaches material in a way that is easy to understand. However, I feel like the grading criteria / requirements are not well outlined, which has resulted in loss of points on some assignments. I would appreciate having a rubric / grading outline for all / most assignments to prevent this problem.","I really enjoy the in - class notes. I believe it is a lot more helpful for learning physics concepts than to watch a presentation of powerpoint slides.","I really like making reading the textbook before class a part of the grade as that makes the lectures feel SO MUCH better than in some of my previous physics classes, where I would try and look at the textbook as little as possible and gleam everything from long, incredibly dense lectures. Of course that's on me, but this style of learning is much more receptive to me. Also, Dr. [Removed] is a really good teacher. He asks if you understand something after he answers your question and will often check in with the TA during class to see if they can offer more information, or put something in a different way for us, or ask a question they might have about the lecture, which is great for us and the TA! Because we aren't learning everything in class, the lectures feel much more free and lighthearted, almost ; there is of course structure, but a lot of room for us to ask questions so we can get insight on what is confusing us instead of going over everything at the same pace, which is often too fast or too slow. Starting the class with a kind of fun, up for interpretation occasionally, [Removed], helps get the class in the right mindset to learn too.","My instructor is very positive and he always includes student in the class and makes it a very interactive experience. He makes the knowledgable course more enjoyable.","Dr. [Removed] clearly cares about his students and is passionate in our learning. You can tell that he will do anything and provide whatever resources necessary if he believes they will help us learn and succeed in his class. I do wish that lectures were a little more clear in explaining the content, and that we were given a little more time to answer the sqarecap polls so we could more deeply understand the questions. The TAs in this class are very attentive and want to help us understand concepts. Overall a good learning environment but a little fast paced.","Dr. [Removed] is an amazing instructor because you can tell that she cares a lot about her students. She always encourage students to talk to each others and help each other out. The collaborative environment really made me enjoy genetic more than I had expected because I find genetic a really hard subject to learn ; therefore, I am really glad that I am able to collaborate on things such as homework and quizzes. I also thought that it was really comforting that Dr. [Removed] said something about how hard genetic is to learn because there was time I felt like I didn't have the capability to learn genetic. However, knowing that genetic is a relatively hard class, it further encouraged me to try even harder to do well in the class knowing that it is normal to think that genetic is hard.","She's awesome. No complaints and she's very understanding.","Nothing. She is just an amazing professor.","She always checks in for anyone who has questions which makes me feel very comfortable.","Dr. [Removed] is very supportive and offers many benefits throughout the course to ensure that students do well in her class.","I think Dr. [Removed] did an excellent job on making us feel comfortable and positive with the material. She reminds us that it's okay to make mistakes and is always motivating us for the future.","Not much. Dr. [Removed] is a solid professor.","I like the overall structure of the course, having the same format of assignments, but building upon them every week in preparation of our final research poster presentation!","He says that time spent \" complaining about homework \" is better spent elsewhere. However, I don't think he realizes how difficult his homework questions are for someone who has not taken physics recently -- or at all.","no I think she is great","Dr. [Removed] is a great instructor! Her lectures are easy to follow as she offers countless resources. She is also very forgiving with grace periods and dropping our lowest grades. It makes me feel like she understands we have lives outside of class and that things can happen. \n","None that stand out to me","He gave a very comprehensive review of basic physics principals to start off the first few days of class.","N / [Removed] Dr. [Removed] has been great so far!","I like it went professors give opportunities for extra credit. I also like it went professors want you to learn and not punish you with a bad grade.","I don't think so.","I feel that I am not benefitting much from his lectures and am having to teach myself the material. Dr. [Removed] gives us great information, but sometimes it is hard to understand it and comprehend topics we need to know for the unit. He is very sweet and considerate.","I hope the instructor could upload the worksheet key after she's done with talking about all these. I think it would be better for me to review the materials before something new comes.","The main instructor has been extremely helpful and clear with directions when necessary.","Review on the day of exam was really helpful.","I like how he is super open to questions and how he uses visual experiments to give real world examples of physics ideas.","Dr. [Removed]'s positivity and openness makes her class very interesting and exciting, despite the difficulty of the material.","having more practice problems that are similar to test questions would help me understand concepts.","I think the professor spends a lot of time on the easier topics and will blow over the more difficult parts. It can definitely be confusing to understand because she will often only teach the way she prefers but it is still a way to get it done. I also think the learning modules assigned are very, very long, it is content heavy which can make it hard to stay motivated. There are many TAs that walk around to answer questions. The professor also doesn't like for us to talk while she is lecturing, understandable but at the same time, it helps to talk with other students while we are being taught to fully grasp the content. In the end, it is just an introduction to [Removed] so it is going to be a larger class but I think there needs to be more understanding towards the student's side.","I feel as though not much has been done to have a significant impact on my feelings towards college or the class.","He uses many visuals and graphic aids to help students visualize physics concepts.","All content is extremely organized and student expectations are very clearly stated.","I feel that my instructor is a very approachable person. I tend to be introverted and don't like to ask questions, but as I went to his office hours I was more engaged in learning and wanted to ask more questions. Even on days I didn't have anything to ask, going to his office hours and just listening to his responses to other peoples questions was very helpful.","Nope, thank - you.","Dr. [Removed] has made genetics way more easier. It is a hard course because of the material but her personality and passion for genetics really motivates me. Her teaching methods are great and she's a very encouraging woman. Can't wait to see how the rest of the semester goes!","Dr. [Removed] is an amazing teacher for intro chem, coming into college I was nervous about taking chem after hearing the horror stories, but Dr. [Removed] has broken it down for me and has provided a great experience. She ensures all her students are engaged and that we are putting ourselves in the best position to succeed by taking advantage of our resources.","She has been very accommodating and supportive for those who have issues or situations to overcome. This has helped me learn better as I had many obstacles to overcome this semester so far. She is also very communicative.","I think that it is a great resource that he uses prelectures and reviews them, but with the time they take up I think it can lead certain conversations to get brought up too much or become too surface level.","Dr. [Removed] always makes everyone feel welcome. It feels nice to have this course since I can relax after a long day of lecture and not have to worry about any pressure from Dr. [Removed] or my peers.","I appreciate that the instructor asks us what topics are “ muddiest ” or most unsure for students, then provides explanations for the topics. This was very helpful and aided in my studying fairly well.","She's very funny and nice, you can tell she is passionate about teaching. She provides a lot of opportunities for us to succeed.","There is far too much content covered in such a short period, and lectures are sometimes rushed since they are only an hour long each. There are also things stated in the syllabus that are not provided for students to prepare for exams, such as practice exams ( besides the last - minute one from a TA ).   [Removed], the professor is incredible, but he could do more to help his students learn better and succeed in the class.","I liked having practice exams. It was useful in preparing for the actual exams.","not in my personal experience","I think this class is very informative on expectations and the level of coursework required. This helps us all to understand what is expected of us and how our research applies to work done in everyday research in higher organizations.","She's very nice and very approachable which is important for a professor. She's extremely willing to help and support her students, which not all professors display","The [Removed] course is sometimes hard to navigate and the learning modules are only posted days before they are due rather than in the beginning of the semester or in a calendar","I have enjoyed the class so far, although I would like to do less practice problems during class and be shown more instruction before working independently. I also have difficulty with the lab assignments and R programming language, so I would appreciate more instruction on that.","He moves fast but provides good material.","I think she is doing her best! It's hard with a subject that complicated with so many people and you tell that she has good intentions.","I would like more practice problems that are similar difficulty to the exam so it gives us better practice for the exam.","I would prefer if Dr. [Removed] worked on some difficult questions with numbers in class rather than mainly conceptual problems. Practicing with harder questions would make the homework a bit easier as well as exams. Using numbers as well will allow us to practice what an actual physics problem is like.","I like how Professor [Removed] gave us motivation tips during exam week. However, I don't enjoy having to teach myself the material before we learn it in class because it makes me more confused.","I really appreciated how much my instructor vocalized that he cared about his students well being because it made me feel important.","Dr. [Removed] is very sweet and knowledgeable, but I often feel intimidated to ask basic questions about some biology concepts. Even her office hours make me nervous. I think offering a discussion section where students refresh on basic biology would be helpful.","nope! But the class is mentally challenging","Everything has been super helpful, esp in class demos and the hw being due every week helps solidify the knowledge \n\n\n","I love how Professor [Removed] creates an environment where I feel comfortable to ask as many questions as I need to in order to understand a concept.","In my opinion, the quizzes with the [Removed] bank of questions are unnecessarily stressful... but that's my only concern!","Our professor often stops class to stop kids from whispering/ talking. Although I understand that the talking can be distracting, I myself never notice or get bothered by it. I think it is more distracting to stop class every 5 minutes. Its also frustrating for the kids who never talk and still get class time wasted due to other students who can't keep quiet. I would recommend just asking them to leave if they are talking instead of taking the class time to make them stop.","I don't blame her for not doing most of this because the class is so large, it is just unrealistic.","He is a great instructor and really cares about all of the students in the class. High praise from me, and I would definitely recommend to everyone for this course.","Professor [Removed] is a great lecturer, plus his labs are well - organized. The lab classes would be better if he is able to make time to help students in the lab sections ( whether it's in - person or virtually ).","During the first two weeks she asked us to talk to the people sitting next to us about something, I am not too sure what it was, but I remember it actually being a very awkward conversation with the people around me and I would have liked a more like lighthearted or fun discussion question.","I believe the instructor is stated at the beginning that this was the first year teaching thermodynamics ( I might be making this up ) so some of the questions were hard to answer or not possible considering this fact.","Allow the TAs to walk around the class and answer questions. Post specific question types and have in depth review sheets.","I like how interactive her classes are and that she gives us an opportunity to do practice problems in class.","Our lab TA speaks in term that are easy to understand and does not use strange scientific jargon when giving us directions. [Removed] also tries to interact with each student individually so we feel comfortable in the lab.","Professor [Removed] has done a great job at structuring the course with well thought out lectures and assignments that help students learn R along with the theory behind data science.","Dr. [Removed] is a very engaging lecturer. His experiments during class to illustrate the content we are learning really creates a memorable experience. I also really enjoy his witty, dry sense of humor that makes his class entertaining. I have not once struggled to pay attention in his class.","He gives half point back to missed questions on midterms, which encourages us to learn our mistakes topics again ; I like it","Dr. [Removed] also tries to learn faces and names and really intract with her students as much as she can. She is very helpful in office hours and incredibly dedicated to what she does, which I appreciate a lot. Dr. [Removed] is approachable as well, and if I had circumstances that hurt my performance in the class or I needed additional help, I would be more than willing to speak with her.","Professor [Removed] is very kind, and I appreciate how welcoming she is to students who may be struggling with the content, and just students in general!","The instructor always has practice questions given to us after discussing a concept. He always encourages us to discuss with our classmates about any questions we may have. He then goes over the questions and gives time for any additional questions we may have.","I would just like to say that the professor has made my introduction into chemistry, thusfar, a joyful and encouraging experience. I would be very delighted to recommend this professor to any one of my peers.","Dr. [Removed] is a very sweet instructor, and she teaches her class the best way possible. She always makes sure that everyone gets all of their questions answered during student hours, and she tries to make the environment more fun and social as well as opposed to being another quiet lecture.","There is nothing notable that I can think of at this time.","The lectures are nice but I often feel somewhat unprepared for the test even though I've used all the resources given, including active recall.","I am very happy and excited about the way this course is structured! Thank you!","Sometimes I feel unprepared to complete the assignments. I attend [Removed] and every class period where I take thorough notes and ask questions but I felt unprepared to do the third homework. I enjoy how class consists of a lot of examples but I felt unprepared for the kind of questions being asked which made me question if I'm missing something. I have a learning disability so sometimes it can be challenging for me to connect dots that are very subtlety placed and I usually need things to be laid out for me to understand them. Especially in a class like physics where I have no experience whatsoever. Overall, I would like to see questions similar to what we are going to be tested on during lecture so I feel more prepared to properly demonstrate what I am learning in class.","Dr. [Removed] seems to be able to create a welcoming environment for both the students, as well as the teaching assistants. Thus, as a student I really feel welcomed by each of the instructors, as they all seem very involved and excited to be there and help the students. Overall, aside from taking the material at a good pace and thoroughly explaining it, I believe that Dr. [Removed] and all the TAs have been able to give students many good opportunities to learn whether inside or outside of class, along with creating a very accommodating and welcoming environment.","I overall enjoy the class. It requires a good amount of work, but if you pay attention and study, you will succeed. The professor wants you to do well.","She is very friendly, and always smiling which makes you look forward to coming to the next class meeting.","Dr. [Removed] often encourages students to ask questions when they are not understanding the topic. However, sometimes the way she responds is simply restating the question / doesn't provide more details / implies that the student should have already know it.","Performed experiments in the beginning of the course helped me and other students pay attention to the topic at hand.","He gives good examples that directly correlate with the homework on [Removed]. This makes the homeworks so much more manageable.","I respect [Removed]'s passion for creating a freshman - friendly course by providing many resources and even looking at tests on a case - by - case basis to get a look at the most accurate grading process in a class of over a hundred students.","I find the instructor's style of lecture to be hard to follow and, at times, unhelpful. The flipped classroom model helps to give and understanding of the class materials going into the class, but further self - instruction is beneficial.","I really like the way the course is currently designed with the [Removed] Types for each unit, it helps me prioritize what I need to understand and the topics I need to study further.","Dr. [Removed] is a very caring professor and genuinely hopes the best for her students. She provides us with a lot of studying material and class content. She provides learning objectives for each chapter of the book we are learning, so we know what to focus on during lecture and for the exams.","I have enjoyed this course quite a bit. It is my favorite course this semester due to the professor, his attitude towards teaching, and teaching style. I find it very easy to ask for help or guidance without any judgement. Professor [Removed] is very easy to speak to and I can tell that he genuinely cares about his students.","I didn't always understand the basic processes. Often he uses examples to help us see, but often it is a little too specific and confusing because he skipped over a more in - depth process description. I also have a difficult time knowing when something is important. I understand that we should learn all we can, but when it comes to studying there is a limited amount of time and brain space. I do appreciate his square caps and discusion sections because they provide additional questions to review before the test so we can become more aquatinted with his style. Overall, he is a very kind and understanding prof, but I don't think his style works for me.","No i think I have discussed it all.","I think the professor is great!","Dr. [Removed] spends a lot of time allowing students to work on practice problems and then goes over them, which is very helpful to me.","I like the speed at which Dr. [Removed] teaches and I appreciate that he makes us check in with our neighbors to ensure we're all grasping the topics.","My instructor is great, she provides a lot of information and source for us to do good in this course. \n","He is good at breaking down problems and answering questions after class","The instructor makes students feel very encouraged to ask questions in class or in office hours which has helped me a lot with understanding new concepts.","He encourages us to ask questions, even if the questions are not the most on topic question. This makes me more willing to ask questions because I know he wants us to learn as much as possible from his class.","Our instructor is incredibly knowledgable, genuine, and makes himself approachable and accessible to students.","I love Dr. [Removed] passion, however the content and rigor of this course is inevitable and does not compare. I feel a little more understanding when it came to grading exams and homework's would be nice. The material is hard and as a student I can guarantee we are doing the best we possibly can even when our grades don't reflect that.","This instructor does not like whispering in the classroom at all and said that she would refrain from giving us as much information as the other sections because of this.","On the first week of school he created an assignment where we had to leave a notecard by his office after class. This helped us know where his office was and when his office hours were, which I thought was really helpful.","The instructor is very thorough with his teaching methods and I have no doubt that if students are having difficulty with the class content, he is more than happy to help.","I would like [Removed] to utilize lecture time as learning time, not review time over content in homework.","He doesn't do much, he reviews the slides and adds a couple items of note that are not included on the slides or textbook, but the relevancy of said notes are unclear. Alongside this, understanding him is a challenge as a result of his accent, tone, and speed of his talking voice. I hear and fully understand every couple words, taking notes with this is more difficult than it should be as I often mishear and misunderstand what he says during lecture.","I wish that we were able to breakdown the practice problems in class because I feel like he jumps ahead and doesn't show how he gets there.","The instructor teaches everything in a smooth but fast paced way that can be caught.","Not much besides the fact that she shows she cares and I really appreciate that!","Office hours are really helpful.","[Removed] is a great instructor because I believe he explains concepts in a manner that most people would understand.","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind man who is visibly passionate about biology. Unfortunately, his lectures are confusing, and the resources given to learn are limited and unhelpful. Most students rely on the textbook and outside resources - such as [Removed] videos - to stay caught up with the material.","Not at this time.","I enjoy the use of squarecap as a way to practice the content after we learn it during the lecture.","The current layout works wonderfully and helps to not put much stress on one's workload. It does extremely help that the deadlines are set for 11:59 PM or an hour before class and that quizzes are based on pre - labs so as to not overexert us.","My professor releases practice exam questions that help ALOT during exam season!! His homework accurately reflects his exams, so it's easy to prepare for the exams.","No - I think the whole teaching team is doing a great job.","I would like the lecture slides to include more notes on them. However, that is just preference as I'm not a good note taker.","She's very involved with the students and I really appreciate that for such a technical course.","The entire layout of the course is incredibly helpful for someone who is barely transitioning into the rigor of college courses. The [Removed], availability of [Removed] / office hours, quizzes, review notes, etc. is a perfect way to set students up for success. Having such a thought - out and established course has definitely helped me.","No, I don't have anything else to add. [Removed] is an amazing professor.","My professor does the best job at going through material with the time she has, so it is understandable if we go a bit quicker than other subjects. There is also a significantly high student to TA ratio, so there s oftentimes a lot of questions that go unanswered.","I am thankful we are encouraged to participate in class activities and instapolls to start applying about the material learned in lecture as soon as possible. This helps get a grasp on information better, or clarifies the material before trying to apply it to concepts in exams.","Professor [Removed] is definitely an excellent educator, and it is clear that he is passionate about the material he teaches. My only complaint with the course is that the homework assignments often do not match the material learned in class, and more classtime could be dedicated to preparing for and understanding the homework.","I love Professor [Removed], as she's a great person and very knowledgeable, but she sometimes teaches very fast and doesn't account for students to not fully grasp a topic. Even if a few students understand a topic she moves on.","I would just say it's a typical intro. class. Nothing special but nothing bad either.","She's nice I like her. Interested in her field.","Shoemaker tries her best to use demos for her lessons. She's very transparent about her work which makes me feel more comfortable with her as a person, not just a professor","No. I need to study more and go to office hours","better study guides for the exams","  I am having a difficult time in this class because I feel like it is so hard to do well on the tests. Since they are only 12 question multiple choice, if you miss 1 question you're already at an A- and if you miss 2 questions you're at a [Removed] I think in the future, it would be a lot more beneficial to students if the tests included more problems so there is more room for error. In addition, I think more practice problems similar to what will be on the test would be helpful to students as well.","Dr. [Removed] is an excellent instructor very understanding and workable. He does tend to speed up his content, but if you keep up with the reading, than you should be overall fine.","The instructor has greatly contributed to my success in this course.","I don't like that in the first unit, we fell behind a lot because it seemed as though Dr. [Removed] wouldn't get straight to the point in the lecture. She uploads videos of Dr. [Removed] as assistance through our learning modules homework, and I feel like I learn more with his videos than I ever do with her. I passed the first unit exam with a 92, but I thank myself and my further studying and research about the unit, not exactly Dr. [Removed].","Our instructor helped us find soil.","I appreciate that my instructor uses a space theme in every lecture. He ties physics into real life stuff and experiences so that we can do the same.","I really like this class, and I love how the class is structured. It is easier for me to focus with the smaller class size and all the grading is fair so far. The only recommendation that I would give is to give us more practice problems throughout the weeks leading up to the exam, so we can all feel more prepared for tests.","I enjoy learning the biological processes on a macro level, and enjoy the videos that we watch to help.","I wish that my instructor would slow down on the more complicated topics, because often times the people around me are just as confused as I am so the small group discussions are not effective and we need further instruction.","I really liked all the resources for exams that set us up for success. It helps knowing what's going to be on the exams and what we should be learning.","I really like how the professor reinforces our learning by referring back to previous material and making us practice it in new circumstances. Usually, she quickly goes over topics and then we see them in practice through the worksheet, lab, and homework. Although this can be a lot of work, I think it really helps me learn. I feel encouraged when I get to have multiple attempts to learn the material. Also, I like it how she discusses that it's totally normal not to feel comfortable with coding and stuff. When she does this, I feel like I'm making good progress and that I'm not behind.","I really appreciate this teaching team and all their support!","She does a lot of good practice examples with us that usually appear in quizzes and examns.","I really enjoy when Dr. [Removed] does [Removed] and how he seems passionate about what he is teaching.","She's a little monotone, but teaches well. I appreciate the resources she gives us to study.","Dr. [Removed] has been very committed to answering questions and asking what the students may need clarification on, and this has allowed for the material to be very accessible. My only critique would be that it would be useful to have more specific practice for the midterm to understand the specific formatting and expectations.","The lectures are an hour and fifteen minutes long, and every class the professor gives a two or three minute break in the middle to relax, chat, and have a snack. I really appreciate the break as it makes the classes feel shorter and less intense and demonstrates, in my opinion, a real care and concern for her students' well - being. She is also generally very friendly and open, joking around and sharing things she personally finds fun and interesting, which makes her feel more like a person you can interact with more freely rather than just an authority figure.","He is very consistent on his teaching method, which made me feel little more confident to adopt to college way of studying.","The chemistry professors met together to discuss questions on our last exam that they felt were unclear. They gave students points back on those questions.","I love the fact that he offers corrections on exams, because especially in a class like physics, you need practice to truly understand what you're doing. And I think having the incentive of doing corrections [Removed] encourages learning of the material. This is my second time taking the course and my experience with this professor has been 10 times better, I actually feel like he cares about us understanding the material.","I really like how Professor [Removed] has organized this course. Since the exams are not high stakes, I feel less pressure to be perfect and am able to focus on understanding the material and appreciating it.","She is doing a great job at teaching physics, I can understand the concepts that I am supposed to learn from the way she lectures. I myself am unsure how some of the questions in this survey can be relevant or implemented into a physics class, but I tried to answer the questions to the best of my ability.","[Removed] is definitely the best of the best! I really enjoy the seminars! They are super informative! Those life skills are definitely going to be valuable! It'll come in handy!","I have nothing to share.","I just very much appreciate how available / active Dr. [Removed] is on [Removed] to help us outside of class time. Physics can be a scary subject to learn, and I feel very supported in his class.","Lectures are enjoyable through the use of many demos and instapolls where you can analyze the problems with your peers.","I filled out the survey about Professor [Removed], but I first wrote Dr. [Removed]'s name. My sincerest apologies. \n\n Also, Dr. [Removed] is the best physics professor I have had. Her words and efforts to connect with students helps motivate me to do my best.","Dr. [Removed] consistently brings a ton of passion and energy to class that makes me feel excited to be there and learn the course content. I'm a chem major so it'd be easy for me to just try and get through this class as painlessly as possible without really taking anything in but Dr. [Removed]'s passion for physics prevents me from falling into that trap. This especially come out when she's doing demos. She always seems super excited to show us the science in action, and you can really feel that energy rub off on the class. People laugh a lot more in that class than in any of my others and genuinely seem like they're having fun.","She is a very sweet person and you can tell she loves her job and cares for her students","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor who wants all of her students to succeed.","My instructor is very nice and always approaches any problem that we encounter positively. Even if some groups didn't get good bacteria that are antibiotic resistant or antibiotic producing, the instructor would explain that these results are still important. There might be other [Removed] pathogens that might have a different result, so it is still important to have that information.","Overall Dr. [Removed] is an amazing and kind professor that is invested in the success of her students. I always love when professors are like Dr. [Removed] as it gives me more motivation to work harder in their class and do better.","One thing that's bothered me is how assignments, even those that don't require prior knowledge, are not made available to complete at our convenience, but are opened at a fairly arbitrary point in the week. For example my lab is Monday at 9 am, so the prelab becomes available 48 hours beforehand on Saturday morning. This means even if I plan my time well, I have no choice but to complete it over the weekend, while other lab sections such as the Tuesday afternoon section have almost 2 full weekdays to complete it. This made me feel frustrated because it feels like our instructor doesn't value our time.","She is very open and approachable.","Although the shear amount of homework can seem intense, I think that the professor is doing a good job to make a notoriously difficult class quite friendly.","Barely any professors do this, but Dr. [Removed] talking about her life experiences and struggles really makes her approachable and relatable. I believe many teaching individuals underestimate this skill. Dr. [Removed] does bring random life events. The life events she talks about is to either reassure or motivate us. This has made it less stressful to learn physics. Also she is incredibly positive and optimistic. This aspect of her is very contagious and that is a good thing.","The way Dr. [Removed] teaches is very difficult for me because he just flys through the slides so I do not learn much. However the discussion class is very helpful for me. There are lots of resources that help a lot and I really like how Dr. [Removed] believes in all of us.","I love her teaching style, however I wish she would go in more detail during lecture instead of just skimming through it quickly","the professor also offers one on ones after midterms which is very helpful.","My instructor is very kind and engaging and I love being in her class, but it is difficult and she moves really fast.","Assignments were posted inconsistently, with many longer modules being posted the day before they were supposed to be due relatively late in the day. This put me and many other students in a bind before lectures.","The instructor is good at teaching just talks too fast and doesn't provide as much detail in lectures. Lectures like already know the concept.","I really like how Dr. [Removed] has different options for the last 5 % of our grade. We can choose to either go to Discussion [Removed], watch and answer questions for [Removed] videos, or do the [Removed] reading assignments. This is very helpful because although I chose the Discussion [Removed] option, I also like to watch the [Removed] videos occasionally when I want to strengthen my understanding on the concept.","I appreciate that she was very understanding in the first few weeks when struggling to submit assingments.","Dr. [Removed] is a very good professor and really cares about the course and the students. I love how she wants to keep improving the course and give students the best experience possible.","I think the usage of worksheets ( R - markdown ) to work through during class provides a hands = on learning experience that helps the programming knowledge stick better ( and ensure understanding ) because students have to interact and work together / independently to figure the questions out.","I have nothing else to share.","[Removed] has been one of my favorite instructors because of his relaxed and welcoming approach to getting to know everybody and breaking the ice between students. It's just a great atmosphere on the class and always feels like a safe space in which I can share my opinions, which I do think depends partly on the instructor of the class.","i really like how she has the question types for each unit and gives us ample resources to prepare for tests.","Dr. [Removed] has had us work together on a few worksheets during class, which I have found helpful. I like also having activities in class that help me actually use / answer questions with the material that I've learned -- I find that it really helps my learning.","Dr. [Removed] takes a personal interest in each and every one of her students. She is very good about ensuring that no one is left behind and that everyone has equal opportunity to benefit from her class.","The instructor isn't great at explaining all concepts and having to do majority independent work to get the material.","When I was struggling with a family emergency and had to go home, Dr. [Removed] was very patient and gave me time to be with my family and complete my assignments with no penalties.","Dr. [Removed] make the classroom experience great!","I appreciate how approachable the instructor is and how he takes each inquiry into deep consideration. He doesn't ever make students feel stupid for asking questions, even if they may be simple.","Often times there is little room or time for questions as the instructor often brushes past all the subjects fast. this leaves students confused and their questions unanswered.","The instructor is very welcoming to students. Encourages us to ask questions and collaborate with her and others in the course.","Overall, [Removed] Hall is a good instructor. Some of this didn't really apply because this course is a lab course, and doesn't have lecture times for it either. So the only content that is important in this course is what we deduce at the end of each lab after experiments. The instructor is very helpful during class, and seems to enjoy being a lab instructor.","Dr. [Removed] is very thoughtful and truly wants us to do well in her class. She's a great professor.","Nothing in particular. I mostly am at school to learn whether the professor makes these acknowledgments or not does not influence that.","Not necessarily.","Overall, I think this course is accessible and informative. Dr. [Removed] is quite approachable and offers many resources and non - required opportunities for students to improve their understanding of physics. She acknowledges the many difficulties that students face in their studies while encouraging them in overcoming them and offering strategies therein.","She cares about her students and makes an effort to reach out if she sees that we are struggling in the class. I did poorly on my first exam and she reached out to offer support and encourage me to attend office hours so she can help me get on track for the next exam.","Professor [Removed] is very thoughtful and kind. She shows a passion for teaching her subject and eases into topics to make learning a smooth process. I can see she is open to taking feedback and shifts her class towards what helps her students more.","There is nothing in particular that the instructor has done to make me feel this way. The class isn't a class where we celebrate our accomplishments, more so move foward and see how we can improve.","She is down to earth, and will tell you what you need to know in many different ways so that if you are even half way awake you will get what you need to know, and so that makes me feel like I can do well in the class. It is quite frankly incredible, the effort she puts in.","He seems like a very genuine guy who wants us to succeed but I am not sure he has the experience that allows him to know where our key points of struggle tends to be.","The instructor's encouragement and recognition of our progress made me feel more confident and motivated to tackle challenging tasks. Their supportive approach created a positive learning environment where I felt valued and capable of applying what I had learned.","I feel like Dr. [Removed] is a very understanding teacher and gives all of her students many options to pick from in order to earn credit in her class. She also has a 24 hr grade period for late assignments which is very helpful when most of her students are taking other rigorous courses. I believe that she is a great teacher and cares very much for her students and their time and personal lives.","The instructor is very specific with the content she lectures about. There is a formal structure to how to both her lectures and the study materials she posts for us. This made me feel more prepared to master the content of each unit.","The instructor is very nice and tries to remember students' names. She genuinely wants to bond with students.","Professor does a really good job of explaining new and challenging materials to the best of her abilities. Makes sure students are ready to move on and is willing to help one - on - one.","She's amazing in my opinion. I love how calm her voice is and how she will practice problems with us during the lecture.","I don't have anything else to add.","The professor has a cheerful personality that makes the course better.","There is nothing much else to share! I just need to study a lot.","She honestly is a good professor i just sometimes she would understand   that we are new to this environment and we don't always know what is happening.","Sometimes my instructors make us feel like they're one of us. The are very welcoming and approachable and any question is a good question to them. I don't feel afraid to talk to them or ask them for anything.","I feel sometimes my instructor takes too long answering people's questions about things that aren't relevant to the course. I think sometimes he should say that their should be no more questions so we can learn relevant material.","The professor takes the time to reach out to students individually if they voice any concerns. They truly care about the class, and I would take this class again as of right now.","I like that she lets us do examples ourself before she does it, it helps me realize what I don't understand.","I really like this course and it makes me feel like I'm contributing to something big","I appreciate that he tries to do a lot of demonstrations that help pull the physics content \" from the page into the real world. \"","I like how Dr. [Removed] reminds us that exam grades aren't everything since we have the chance to retake two at the end of the semester. It makes me less stressed for exams and creates a good learning environment.","Keep up the great work!","I feel like he approaches physics with the mindset that anyone can learn it. I really appreciate that. I feel like it can be really easy to get discouraged if you do not get something and everyone around you does. I like that he still tries his best to push everyone.","She had fun experiments during class that made the class more enjoyable.","I am satisfied with my professor.","This class I have felt successful in because Dr. [Removed] presents students with many opportunities to succeed. She posts detailed learning modules for knowledge prior to the lectures and posts several resources for studying for exams.","Most of my friends failed the first test despite having prepared well. I think the instructor might have covered more in - depth the sort of material which would be on the exam.","He is doing a good job, I enjoy his class and will recommend to others","I am really enjoying this class, and hope to see what the future leads to!","Dr. [Removed] is very nice and her attitude makes me want to attend her lectures. I was scared about this course but she has made the concepts very simple in how she describes things and I know I have her support if I ever need help with anything.","Giving us a wealth of resources to study and review with has been really helpful in coping with the workload of a college course","Dr. [Removed] is a phenomenal professor and he is the standard I hope to see in future classes. He is genuinely invested in teaching and understanding these concepts out of [Removed] it's clear he doesn't view it a boring responsibility. His lectures are easy to follow and concise. I don't feel shy about asking for clarifications when I need it and I do feel like I learn [Removed] [Removed] at a fundamental level. His grading is completely fair and the workload is pretty good. I believe he doesn't feel the need to drown us in work to prove that we are learning, the [Removed] are enough. Simply amazing professor.","I think Dr. [Removed] does a great job of fostering an inclusive learning environment. The flipped classroom takes a bit getting used to, but with the right discipline, likely leads to better learning outcomes than a traditional classroom.","He is very open and receptive in class. Very kind, which creates a comfortable environment.","I really appreciate this teaching team!","I enjoy Dr. [Removed]'s class. She is very accommodating and helps us understand the material.","I just really enjoy all the resources that she provides. It makes a scary class feel less scary.","The teacher is very nice and appreciate that she gives us the resources to succeed.","Professor [Removed] is extremely supportive and encouraging towards students regarding exams and quizzes. She constantly reassures us of our abilities and understanding which leads towards less stress and more confidence when taking these assessments.","The instructor may not be clear and sometimes have a hard undertstanding but the TAs are resourceful","No, I think he is a good instructor.","I like the instructor's optimistic attitude towards the class while constantly encouraging that we can pass, make mistakes, and learn. It is great to have a vocal support system for students who might not have any or a lot.","I think she could be a little bit more encouraging during class and give out more words of encouragement.","I think Dr. [Removed] is very understanding and genuinely wants the best for all her students. She understands that even though grades don't matter, it can have a mental toll on students and make them feel defeated. Therefore, she always encourages us to schedule meetings to discuss ways to succeed, but she also tells us to attend office hours for more support. Hearing Dr. [Removed] say these things makes me feel like I have a better support system within the course and that I could honestly tell her how I feel about [Removed], knowing I would receive proper knowledge and help when I leave.","Dr. [Removed] is super interactive and a great professor! She makes a very hard class enjoyable and even when times are tough, I know she believes that I can succeed!","[Removed] always makes sure that we are in a safe environment and that our concerns are valid and she provides a classroom where we can grow personally and professionally.","I really appreciate the structure of the course and how it is centered around practicing during class and the support we get outside of class. I like to learn by doing and I feel like this class allows me to do so.","Not that Professor [Removed] isn't clearly a nice woman, but she's aggressive about our whispering in class despite barely any sound being made, and whatever little discussion happening being about class or trying to understand content of the course because the actual lecture barely teaches us content. The majority of the time is either [Removed] saying that we're whispering, or giving us a bunch of examples but not properly explaining how to do them.","The only thing that made this class difficult was the style of the lecture which often felt slow at times and didn't always follow along with the learning modules ( sometimes would touch on material not yet administered via learning modules ). Additionally, the pacing of the lectures would lead to the professor rushing through numerous slides within the last minutes of the class, impending my ability to actually take anything away from the lecture. Apart from this it's very clear the professor wants her students to succeed and gives a multitude of resources to make this a realistic possibility, and I very much appreciate it.","The course encompasses so much. Going by the textbook, it is a chapter a week. This means that sometimes people can get left behind if they don't rapidly intake new knowledge. It feels compressed.","She is extremely approachable and I feel comfortable reaching out to her.","I appreciate how this class encourages students to do well. [Removed] has the reputation of being difficult to pass, but our professor has done a good job making it seem less intimidating. Through the test preparation files and all of the extra support that we have, I feel confident in my ability to pass this class, and even get an A!","He's good at answering questions. If he doesn't know the answer of the top of his head, he'll research it and answer it in another class.","She encourages us to keep learning and keep our eagerness to learn about chemistry going. She reiterates mistakes on exams although feel devastating are ok, and normal. She encourages us to utilize re - take opportunities and try for better results. She encourages us to prove to ourselves that we can do it.","Nothing specific.","I like how she is always to answer everyone's questions and help them in any way for them to understand.","Really great professor","She's very nice and has been a really good professor.","I like her positive disposition and how enthusiastic she is about the subjects we discuss.","Not really ; good guy, just kinda someone who goes through the material fast. But I guess that's college.","This instructor is great! There are some cases where she wouldn't mention certain parts that I said \" No \" to but that's because it wasn't necessarily relevant. I also think that TAs are sometimes previous students who can provide recommendations about curriculum and coursework.","The professor has been fair and accommodating.","She's the best!","No, I believe I added all that I needed to add.","Post the lecture slides before the class on Wednesday so we are able to a study before the quiz.","She asks after every topic if everyone understands what she is saying but because there are so many people in the class, your opinion doesn't really matter but that is not the instructor's fault, more it is just because general chem is a large class always.","I wished there was like a concept check that we could do on our own outside of class after the lectures.","She is a great teacher and very supportive and taught me about growth mindsets.","I really love how organized this instructor is in terms of helping us prepare for exams.","The instructor is good over I have no complaints, I like the teaching style and the way the instructor handles class as a whole.","I feel like we don't get through the slides enough. Class will be half way over and were not even half way through the slides. And then she has to rush through the rest. Also I don't like how we have quizzes on material we just learned that day. I understand that may be personal issue.","He is very welcoming and open to asking questions.","The instructor has many good components of the course, however more practice problems or homework may help students be better prepared for the exams.","One thing that Dr. [Removed] has repeated throughout the class that has lifted my spirits was saying that physics is a challenging topic to grasp, and that it is normal to struggle with concepts. However, he has offered extra help in the form of multiple sessions of office hours per week to the students that are truly struggling.","Dr. [Removed] is very passionate about the course he teaches and very charismatic in teaching that course. I appreciate how he includes examples of the moon landings and astronauts it keeps the class interesting and you can see he really enjoys what he teaches. He is also quite considerate of all his students despite having such a large class so I think having him as a professor will definitely change my perspective on physics for the better!","I wish practice tests were still provided, he used to. Other bio professors have their students getting above [Removed] on the tests yet our average was very low.","Dr. [Removed] is an excellent professor he just moves very quickly.","Dr. [Removed]'s class is huge so I don't have the chance to get to know her personally but I know she is very cool and fun anyway. I really like how organized this course is despite the class size which I why I think Dr. [Removed] is a great instructor.","I think my instructor is doing her best to make sure there is a direct and clear path to success within her class. While it does require extra work, she provides us with the resources for success. The only thing I dislike is that certain class materials, like the learning modules, are not always provided with enough advance but are necessary for an understanding of the material within in - class learning. I also believe that the communication on when it is most useful to complete these by should be more clear. Sometimes it states they should be done by a certain time on the assignment but the due date is set to a later time and I believe this makes some confusion.","I really like this course and feel like it's an effective and great way to get people more involved in research. However, there does seem to be a lot of busy work but I understand the point of most assignments.","Dr. [Removed] does an excellent job at explaining difficult statistics concepts, especially since there are many students who are seeing this content for the first time. She provides many opportunities for practice and assistance through office hours which makes me feel supported as I learn this topic.","No, the instructor has not done anything else in class that I am inclined to point out or share.","I have nothing else to share! I highly enjoy the dynamic of this class compared to most of the other STEM courses I have taken here at [Removed]!","I LIKE HER WAY OF TEACHING","Dr. [Removed]'s passion for statistics has rubbed off on me. I think her enthusiasm for what she's teaching makes learning the topics easier and relieves my stress. When I go to office hours, she explains my mistakes or questions in a very kind and thoughtful way.","My instructor tries to make it a fun environment in such a big class size. It can also make it difficult to cater to a lot of students, so there are many resources that are provided to help us succeed.","Overall, the Dr. [Removed] seems to be one of the better, if not best options to take for engineering physics. I have heard that most of the physics professors at [Removed] are not great ; however, Dr. [Removed] seems to be a rare exception. He cares for his students, and he really wants to have as much of an open discussion and dialogue class as possible. Professors need to prioritize engaging their students over vomiting as much information onto them as possible, and Dr. [Removed] definitely does a great job of this.","I really enjoy how the professor will come up to us while we are working on our class activities to ask us how we are doing not only with the material but in life in general.","Overall, the course has been challenging and engaging.","I would reccomend making the grading policy a little less harsh. The minimum grade for an A is a 94 while most other professors make it a 93.","The instructor is very accommodating to students and allows an opt - out option for lectures and discussions, offering a redistribution of grading percentages to not include attendance. Even though I prefer to attend in - person lectures, this practice made an impression on me because it showed that the professor was understanding of students' needs and understood that people learn differently.","Dr. [Removed] makes the class engaging and followable. He explains and addresses questions students have very well. The class is also entertaining with his humor.","Mrs. [Removed] moves too fast and does not always go in depth about what is being taught. I often leave her lectures confused.","I think professor [Removed] maintains a pretty professional relationship with her students during lecture. I'm unaware of what she is like during smaller settings like office hours because I have yet to attend one. I've attended her TA's office hours and they are competent and know what they're talking about!","I wish we used the lecture times more productively, I feel like I am forced to learn all the content outside of class instead of actually during the lecture. Also, it's hard to understand units because we always mix content from later units and overcomplicate details that aren't necessary and it becomes confusing.","He had a very uplifting positive attitude","Yes, having [Removed] Discussion open during lecture in which he often stops to answer questions in the thread from other students has been a game changer when in comes to student - professor interactions.","I liked how much he stressed the important concepts.","The professor is very sweet and seems to care about the success of the class although some of his questions require very advanced knowledge which I don't think necessarily makes sense for an into to biology class.","He's actually a good professor my only complaint would be how fast he goes on the lectures and how soon he starts the next unit after just finishing the last. I am studying a new unit while trying to understand the next one and it is pretty hard.","The professor oftentimes asks us to talk to our peers around us about an unfamiliar concept to make sure we understand, however if you sit next to people who are equally as confused as you are then this is not beneficial, and she will oftentimes simply move on expecting that we all understand when that is usually not the case.","The instructor was incredibly helpful during student hours, patiently going over homework problems, which made me feel more confident and supported in mastering the material. \n","You're awesome, and I like your polos!","Most of the topics previously mentioned do not refer to the lab setting of [Removed] Lab, in which the instructor mainly acts as a loose proctor within experiments rather than an actual lecturer or provider of information.","I really like how our professor teaches, it is very clear and I learn a lot from her. I also really appreciate the study guides she has available for us.","He's good at incorporating examples into his lectures that we've seen in real life.","1 believe the instructor should open the prelabs 96 hours before the first lab of the week. Additionally, 1 do not believe we should do quizzes but rather more practical examinations as those will curry on for future lab courses.","The course is extremely fast paced, it typically takes me between 48 and 96 hours to fully grasp the material. Quizzes occur on a weekly basis every Wednesday ; I had even 24 hours more to review the [Removed] before the next quiz I would understand it so much more. Because the content slides aren't posted in advance, there's no way to review early.","I have come back to Professor [Removed] to take [Removed] [Removed] after taking [Removed] [Removed] I really like her teaching style and easy communication, and I was so happy that I'd be able to take another class with her.","I think that she lectures too slow, she's not good at managing time we never get to go over all the material in lecture. However, I do feel like the resources and other aspects of the class make up for it and make it easy to succeed. That just would be my only compliant.","The instructor provides good extra credit opportunities and overall makes it easy to do well in the class.","I really like her and the layout of the class. I wish we had more practice problems during class","I feel as though the lectures are a bit loosely structured, and in order to truly learn in the class you must take some time to digest the information outside of class hours. I'm not opposed to this and I think this should be the norm for classes, but it is sometimes hard to learn when irrelevant discussions occur throughout the lecture.","I believe it would be helpful if, instead of relying heavily on slides or scientific jargon, she used real - world examples or analogies to explain the processes.","I like that our professor wants us to strive in her class and if you need help she is more than happy to help.","I like that the instructor prepares us well for an exam by giving us plenty of practice through learning modules and practice exams. i really like that the instructor allows us 3 tries on the learning modules, and I feel that I score better due to the lack of pressure to do well. When I get something incorrect, I take the opportunity to learn the concept better rather than rushing quickly to get a good grade, as there are very low stakes. However, I wish the weekly quizzes were more flexible, and I wish it could be a better learning opportunity. If I get something wrong, I don't go back and correct my mistake as I feel unmotivated. However, If there were better opportunities for the quizes, I think I would score higher and also learn better.","I'd like to be clear that the instructor I m reffering to was my lead instructor [Removed] [Removed], he has been great, passionate and straightforward. The learning assistants have also been wonderful. The name I put down for instructor who most impacted this course was the TA [Removed] because he negatively impacted my course greatly because of his attitude with students.","Professor [Removed] does a great job creating a light environment.","His general demeanor is very welcoming and respectful. He seems to understand very well what it is like to be a student","[Removed] she lit.","I would prefer to have professors that have open - note exams with exams weighing lower than our homework. If a professor helps us prepare for our future classes in the major, that would be helpful.","I don't really like chemistry, but I am not doing as bad in this class as I thought I would. I feel like chem courses are usually really hard to pass, but I've understood about 75 % of the material without crazy studying.","I have understood from multiple people that she is pretty rude to students.","She doesn't let people talk about what is happening in the class even if they are whispering. She derails the class to talk about how my class is the worst whispering class.","I have thought that this class has been a great opportunity to develop a new set of skills and has been effective at helping to teach me to apply concepts in kinematics.","No, I just think he teaches differently than my learning style","I really like the real - world examples and how he lectures but I think it would be nice to learn a little bit more about our instructor.","Dr. [Removed] is the nicest person ever","I liked how engaging the professor tries to make her class!","I think the instructor's positive attitude and just overall joy for what they do makes you want to show up to class everyday.","Nope! Dr. [Removed] is a great overall person, and is someone that really cares for her students as well as the material taught.","As a student who has difficulty concentrating on reading textbooks for long period of time due to [Removed], I really appreciate the diverse amount of resources that Professor [Removed] and her TAs put out such as the handouts and lecture slides. One slight change I might recommend is to have more visual resources such as helpful videos or diagrams that show how each concept relate to each other, but this is a minor concern since there are still many resources available for visual / auditory learners such as CSS and discussions. I also really appreciate the practice quizzes that Professor [Removed] puts out, since it helps me feel prepared for the quiz and motivated in the course, which is a big help for my perfectionism and anxiety over academia, especially since I have previously failed a biology course due to this.","I thought that the instructors were incredibly helpful when it came to making the students feel understood and engaged in class.","I don't have anything specific to say besides how helpful [Removed] is during lab. If you aren't sure about something you can always ask and she will clarify anything for you or give you her input.","I think the resources provided along with the course are very helpful and important to succeeding in the class.","Great class! Professor [Removed] helps make it easy to understand and wants his students to learn and succeed.","Caudill does touch base after each subject, but she kind of just reads off the slides, and then rushes at the end of the lecture. I guess its just the pacing of the lectures, but most times the learning modules kind of teach most of the material, so a little touch base and then moving on top the new material would be more helpful, in my opinion.","Sometimes the professor doesn't time the lectures appropriately, so we end up behind. This means we have to speed through some of the lecture slides faster than I would like. While the content isn't difficult to review on my own, it can be frustrating when we fall behind.","I liked that the instructor is relatable and mentions mental health as being an important aspect of learning","She's absolutely brutal when someone gets the question wrong that she asked. This girl answered it wrong and she was like' no, that's completely incorrect. \" Everybody I've talked to about it is like I'm never answering a question from her ever again because she was blunt as hell about it [Removed].","N / A I love her!","He has been a good instructor, and I really enjoy this course!","The professor cares about the students feelings not just teaching. I like the professor.","Really like how Professor [Removed] gives us lots of example problems and helps us solve them in class. I also like how her class is very consistent and she tells us what to expect for the upcoming week through her announcements.","During lab, it can be hard to hear the instructor and oftentimes she doesn't speak up. Due to not being able to hear her, I don't have a very clear understanding of the things she is discussing and sometimes get confused. She also moves quickly through the material and everything feels rushed. This makes me anxious and I tend to rush through important steps ( especially when learning new techniques ) instead of focusing on proper technique.","his lectures are informative but not super helpful for learning the material and making it stick but he does have a lot of questions to practice from","It is not really a class that deserves feedback. It is set up to set us students up for success and to share resources the university provides.","I think the true / false question are a really good test of knowledge. I have never had true / false questions on a test, so they were a surprise for me at first. However, they really force you to conceptually understand what you are working with as opposed to just numbers into equations.","She is a great professor and has one a fantastic job teaching the course. Her student hours are extremely helpful whenever I needed help. Her TA, [Removed], is also a very helpful resource, especially with the weekly discussion sections.","I do wish, though, that she would not condemn whispering as much in her class. I understand that sometimes it can be annoying, but there have been times that I did not understand parts of the material, and I asked either a peer or even a TA to explain it to me. Both times, the professor asked the peer and TA to keep quiet and for students with questions to write them down. While I understand her viewpoint and frustration, if I am confused with one part of the lecture, as she attempts to build off of it, I won't understand the rest of the material as I didn't understand the concepts she is attempting to build off of. I think she is a nice person, though. I just wish she'd be a little more forgiving of whispers related to the concepts, at the very least if it is between a student and one of the TAs.","My instructor has been very good for the most part. While we are moving fast, it is manageable. I wish at the start she honed in more on what we should be doing to study for tests and give a rundown of what to expect for each unit.","He is very straightforward with how he grades and what he expects and I like that","Her class has us collaborate with our table mates every day. She will also often start the class with small check - ins or ice breakers. I feel that this has been something very important to me because she has made the class much more comfortable to be in.","The instructor has been very willing to help. She is great about checking in with students, keeping the pace of the class reasonable and providing students with valuable opportunities to learn and demonstrate their knowledge.","i love how an 88 is an A-. that makes me excited to actually put in the effort and try for this class because an 88 is more doable than 90","I honestly love the postivie and encouraging environment that you have created for us. It feels like a safe space to learn and also to make mistakes.","Dr. [Removed] is one of the most encouraging professors I've had at [Removed]. [Removed] is a challenging subject ( and one I've personally never learned before ), but she aims to make it simple and accessible to everyone in her class. She encourages making mistakes and emphasizes their importance in the learning process. Finally, she talks about her own challenges and failures in her career. As someone who has struggled academically but still wants to be successful in my field, her dedication to sharing her story has made an incredible difference in my life. I truly believe her attitude and approach to teaching is one of, if not the most, encouraging I've come across at [Removed]. Science can feel inaccessible at times and Dr. [Removed] is moving mountains in her mission to create an environment where students feel comfortable and confident in their ability to learn.","A lot of in class demonstrations made learning the current material much easier for myself.","She's really nice and comforting.","No, everything is going smoothly so far and I am enjoying this lab, way better than chem introductory lab.","I don't like how [Removed] is constantly reviewing content rather than teaching at times. Also, during the week of exams, he is teaching new content while students are focusing more on exams which means a lack of learning. The grading curve could also be improved a lot of the time.","The class is challanging but I truely in joy it","I think by allowing us to share about our week ( through [Removed] / crappies ) and then rewarding us for sharing, the professors have encouraged honesty and transparency amongst students. This is really important and I encourage that other professors use a similar approach to work around students being nervous or anxious to share about themselves.","I think more guidance in taking notes in this class, and more structure on what is required to know and what is not required, that distinction will save a lot of students time and energy.","I think he's a great professor. He enjoys the content.","She encourages us to come to office hours and to rely on our peers, TA's and other resources when we are stuck on a problem, teaching us that even the brightest mind will need help eventually.","there is nothing else","My instructor is very kind, understanding, and super helpful. I really enjoy being in her section.","I love Professor [Removed]'s class because I don't feel stressed about my grade, and I can instead focus on learning the material and applying it.","The professor has a syllabus that states all the expected dates which is common. This is the only form that we have about makeup policy etc. This is a good form of communication so there is no confusion.","Dr. [Removed] is a very caring person that genuinely hopes to see you succeed. I also believe the smaller class size lends to a greater sense of community in the class, letting me feel like I truly fit in.","i wish the emergency drops would be for my personal use rather than faults with the websites","This professor will talk about the importance of mental and emotional wellness and how it ties into academic success, and ties in her own experiences with it. I think this has been very beneficial and is very relevant and relatable to alot of students, and personally I have found that it makes me feel more understood, motivated, and relaxed when learning. I greatly appreciate this and think it's great!","She is great and teaches very well!","I do remember her throughout last week, explain that there are different accommodations for rigorous classes that we have available to us, for example, chemistry. I also remember that she mentioned the different out of class resources available to us as tutoring.","No. Dr. [Removed] is teaching a great physics class.","The instructor was very willing to answer questions - even on the smallest parts of lab. She is very helpful and is always walking around the classroom.","In - class quiz questions should come from the things we learn from the lecture, not from the modules or readiness assignments.","She made the lab very homey because the ta's and her interact with us a lot and are very kind \n","At times it seems like important information is said so fast that I can not write it down or type it fast enough. It could be helpful to repeat key ideas so there is time to absorb it.","She does a great job!","In terms of feedback, I like the way the course is structured right now! Gives ample time to learn the material, practice, go to Lab or [Removed] while not taking up an excessive amount of time outside of class to do these tasks.","Professor [Removed] has been one of the best professors I've had so far. It is clear she cares about her students and the connections that she wants them to build. She gives us many opportunities to succeed, not wanting to let us fail / suffer from our mistakes. Rather, she allows us to make mistakes and grow / learn from them without fearing that we will lose points / get a lower grade. I love how she makes an effort to learn about her students and engage them in the material, as I think that helps the most with retention, as active participation in class helps information stick better. All in all, I wish I had a lot more professors like Professor [Removed], although I believe she is more capable to connect with her students than other professors due to the smaller size of her class.","She is a great professor with a clear grading structure.","He's just a very cool and nice person and I appreciate how generous he is with what can be graded and allowing corrections on exams which is an encouragement of possible failure and an allowing of failure to be ok at the same time.","There is not. I genuinely enjoy the course, and think the pacing, difficulty, and everything in between is perfect.","In general I like that the instructor injects his personality and personal life / experiences into the lessons as it really humanizes him and shows that he's not just a person feeding us information, but a person who is deeply passionate about the subject material.","I think that Professor [Removed] does a great job of trying to help students truly understand the topics covered in this class without emphasizing studying to the exam. In my opinion, I think that the course would be a little better is Professor [Removed] went a little slower and tried to simplify the content to help us grasp it better.","I love the collaborative setting to be able to work together.","Dr. [Removed] is amazing. She is one if not the most caring professors I have had at [Removed]","Dr. [Removed] is very nice and good at breaking down the information in an easy to understand way.","I enjoy the way Professor [Removed] gives us examples to practice on but often my brain does not work fast enough to answer the question on my own before she provides the answer. However, I understand that time is limited and their are specific topics she must complete to stay on track!","Not really, I like the attitude she brings to class everyday she is always positive.","He gives us extra credits. This makes the course experience more positive.","I really like her :) I think she's really great and I love having all the study resources","This class is very well structured.","I really liked the study guide and practice exams she offered to everyone for studying. I wish there were more questions on the practice exams to study. I don't much like the group projects. They seem a little out of the scope of the class in terms of data organizing and stuff like that. I feel like it's a little harder to do, but that just may be something she is doing to expose us to it. Also, she seems really kind which makes me want to listen and learn in her lectures more.","I like that Prof. [Removed] explains the content very carefully and uses images and diagrams to deepen our understanding of the theory behind what we are learning.","I really appreciate Dr. [Removed]'s apparent care for his students and his passion for teaching others. He shares valuable life experiences and examples that help us connect concepts to the real world. It is clear that he loves his job and wants others to enjoy learning and gain something from his course.","I wish Dr. [Removed] spent more time sharing how concepts connect across the unit and across course content. During his lectures, he often just reads the slideshow which has minimal information on them to begin with. I feel like the lectures would be more beneficial if they followed closer to what would be asked on the squarecaps and exams.","Dr. [Removed] does a good job at encouraging students to ask questions and to visit office hours so he can clear up any confusion in this very challenging course.","I like my instructor and I like the structure of the course so far, so I'm interested in seeing what comes next","nope, he's a good professor","I really like the unit review structure and the very clear expectations of what will be on the exam. In previous STEM courses, the review guides were overwhelming and vague, often not knowing what material I should prepare. In this course, the question types allow me to organize my studying and feel confident before exams.","Suffering through the class because the test doesn't really reflect what you learn since your grade can go down with a simple mistake on a conceptual questions","Dr. [Removed]'s compassion is truly what makes her class amazing! She cares about her students, both in their learning and their overall mental health, and I think out of all my professors', she's been the best at creating a positive learning environment. I also think her dividing the class into \" teams \" is pretty innovative and it's helped me get to know more of my classmates, and hear diverse perspectives and explanations!","I think that the course so far provides all the materials I need to be successful in it. I think it could be improved with smaller handouts that are more specific to only the concepts and with maybe one or two exercises. I like looking at the handouts after class, and I think this would make it easier to follow.","When Dr. [Removed] and TAs hold extra student hours it is very helpful especially on the days leading to an exam. It's also helpful that Dr. [Removed] records her student hours as some students can not always make it to student hours.","Dr. [Removed] has been a very passionate, caring, and knowledgeable professor this far who wants what is best for her students while also ensuring her students are maintaining a healthy lifestyle.","I feel like Dr. [Removed] could better explain many of the concepts he goes over in class in further detail, especially for students without prior experience in biology. He could also try to specify important concepts we need to know for success int he course without knowledge dumping on the entire class.","i do not like how we do not get to choose our own lab groups for lab. i am working with someone who does not do anything and talks too much, so lab is very unenjoyable for me.","He's a nice professor and man but it is important to put your own outside work","The instructor is wonderful and provide guidance depending on the situation and the student. However, the student assistant of the professor don't have similar approach to teaching others.","do a good job in making sure we understand the material even though we have a big class size.","Nothing really. Dr. [Removed] has been a great professor so far and I like how he really tries to connect us to the course with things like demos or space stuff.","Dr. [Removed] and her teaching assistants created a very welcoming and supportive classroom environment, which significantly enhanced my learning experience. Their approachability and constant readiness to help with any difficulties made it easier to engage with the course content and reach out for assistance without hesitation. They frequently checked in on students' understanding during and after lectures and were always available for extra help during office hours.","I do not like how our instructor is inconsistent with the amount of time spent on each slide. It feels like the material is being rushed toward the end of class.","No, everything is good, just the tests are very hard.","he talks to fast and he talks to us like we know the content but I don't and I would like to get more details on the content","I think this professor is very understanding of students work load and personal matters and does the best for us to understand the topic at hand.","It would be helpful for me if the pre - lab was open beginning on Friday so I could do it earlier over the weekend. It opens for my section on Sunday and I have to do it then because of my class schedule on Monday.","Not so much about the instructor, because it has been a good experience so far, but one thing I'd keep in mind is about how much space each student has on the desk during quizzes / exams. There isn't much space to work with so sometimes that's an issue. Another thing I would recommend is if a student misses out on a lecture due to a legitimate reason there should be a way he / she can make it up.","I have overall enjoyed the structure of this class","I appreciate the amount of examples and resources provided, especially with the question types and unit review notes!","I would have enjoyed going over the learning modules in lecture instead of it being self - taught","I believe Mrs. [Removed] has promoted an environment where students are able to succeed, given the plethora of test - prep resources and re - assessment opportunities. This creates a culture where students are eager to learn and grow intellectually, not just within the class but even across campus.","Dr. [Removed] provides us with so many reviews, extra practice, and review sessions so that we are able to succeed in her class. I could not have asked for a better learning experience, especially for a class that I am not the most strong in.","[Removed] instapoll over squarecap pleaseee","Caudill mainly refers to pre - medical students while trying to encourage people. There isn't much diversity in the careers she emphasizes.","The information in the course is related to future courses and unit and explains in role it plays.","He is pretty chill and a bit monotone at times, but he feels dedicated to helping you learn in a laid back sort of way","Dr. [Removed] has been the perfect teacher for an intro chemistry class for me! She treats us with the respect of people / students learning at a higher level, but makes chemistry topics seem very simplistic / easy to grasp with her teaching style. She poses lots of questions to see if we are getting the material, which is very helpful in seeing the areas I need to improve in. She also never treats us as if we're dumb when asking questions and provides so many extra learning opportunities with her and her TAs' multiple kinds of office hours.","Great professor","I have already taken this class in high school and now taking it with a better professor has made the class so much easier and I understand the information now.","Dr. [Removed] is very caring and understanding when it comes to mishaps with an exam, sickness, technological troubles, and any issues we may face that prevent us from learning. These actions and empathy towards situations helps to create a more fulfilling learning environment that is not constantly pressurized by the need to succeed, but rather by fostering the growth of the individual student.","Dr. [Removed] is a phenomenal instructor and really wants us to understand genetics and why things happen rather than just memorizing definitions and ratios. She loves when students ask questions which is great but I'm just an extremely shy person, so I typically don't.","I love the class a the instructor. i appreciate the amount of extra credit offered. I would ask for more practice questions or quizzes or more detailed reviews.","I think first off its difficult to fully answer this survey as I've only been part of the course for around 6 weeks. That being said, while its difficult for Professor [Removed] to really integrate discussions in her lectures, I would appreciate it more if she made class a bit more interactive.","Not all exam questions are not very similar to the homework, there are certain concepts that are hard to understand when not related to real life. However, her specific squarecap questions keep my attention on the lectures","Teaching style is very effective.","One thing I would like to add is that Dr. [Removed] often times spends awkward amounts of time on different topics of varied difficulty during lecture. For example, she may teach at a much slower pace at the beginning, giving students multiple minutes to discuss very simple topics that had already been clearly answered before. This will leave little time at the end of lecture to adequately explain harder and more detailed topics, so it seems like she rushes at the end at times to make sure she gets through all of her slides for the day. This results in my peers and myself to be overly confident on a topic we already understood but still lost on the important ones that she rushed through during the last 5 minutes of lecture.","She is a great teacher","I feel like [Removed]. [Removed] has done a great job so far!","The instructor is helpful with recommending and supplying resources for students to use. Take initiative over your studies and you'll be fine.","The instructor hasn't done anything negative, the class has been nothing but relaxing.","She spent a lot of time in the last class ( September 30 ) waiting on students to stop whispering during class, but I felt that created a stressful environment that was frustrating and made me feel like the class was getting behind even though it is difficult to control an entire class of hundreds of students to ensure that there is complete silence","She is very nice and has a lot of resources for students who need extra practice for the exams or just over content.   This is very important for students because she even provides practice exams that are harder than the actual exam that makes students feel more comfortable and ready for the exam.   Only critique would be the learning modules, I would just like an announcement that there are more than usual learning modules to complete and when they are posted since some are posted later than expected.","Dr. [Removed] often interrupts class to tell the class to be silent during lecture, which is understandable and fair, but she does this so much to the point where our lecture is behind. Personally, I feel that Dr. [Removed] allocates too much time towards group discussion when working on practice problems. However, it is evident that Dr. [Removed] knows the material she is teaching, but it is unclear for the students.","With how the course is so far, I personally think the encouragement during lecture time to engage in discussion with our peers and the professor himself is a great supplement to our learning experience. I also like how the homeworks provide us an idea of how the exam will be formatted, allowing us students to prepare better and learn effectively.","I love her! She truly cares for her students and gives us every opportunity to do good","very kind professor. love how honest and open she is. very grateful to have such a humble professor who understands how different backgrounds can impact our previous knowledge and how there are barriers to entry in stem fields.","So far, I love Professor [Removed]'s class! I used to hate chemistry in high school, but her class has been really fun as she teaches the concepts really well. The learning modules are super helpful too!","Dr. [Removed] is amazing and definitely one of my favorite if not my favorite professors. She is so kind and truly cares about her students. I feel that the material can be challenging and fast - paced at times, but I really benefit from her office hours and discussion sections. She makes class so fun and interesting, and she is an amazing professor to have especially as a freshman.","During the in class activities Dr. [Removed] would go into the rows and assist students that need help, which is nice.","Dr. [Removed] can be hard to hear at some times so students usually crowd the front of the room. The slides also go fast so studying beforehand is a must. There is a lot of extra credit, however, which I appreciate.","She is a very genuine, understanding, and approachable professor. Extremely nice!","Very nice and helpful during class","I really love Dr. [Removed].   I think he cares a lot about his students doing well and is very passionate about teaching.   I also hope to LA for him in the future because he's reignited my passion for physics.   I wish all the best to him!","She gets into the lesson really fast, and I feel like I have to pay attention very well in class, or I will miss vital information.","The instructor is always excited to teach the class and comes with a positive attitude which is reflected upon the class and is overall a really amazing thing a professor can do","I'd like her to not be playing music in class while she's actively instructing all of us, it makes it kinda hard to follow what she's saying at times.","She is very sweet and I can't wait to learn more!","Her encouragement is helpful","N / A I believe my instructor is doing a wonderful job at interacting with students and teaching the material","Prof. [Removed] is very nice and actually cares about students","The reminders that we were capable of doing well on the test and that we knew the material were encouraging, but I wish she did not waste so much class time quieting down students since the lecture hall holds 300 students and this task was pointless.","She did experiments for the class and explained why they did and didn't work. She also explained things through imagry which makes it much easier to visualize problems, especially in a class like this","The course lectures are very fast and much of the class is left confused or unclear because the rate is faster than people can formulate questions or understand what they don't understand to the degree of being able to articulate a question. This leaves many people needing outside help and committing additional time and energy to learn from things that were not clear in lecture and there was no time to ask about because the professor moves too quickly usually from material subjects. Not everytime but certainly often enough to leave many confused.","She alwasy seems to say for everyone to stop the whispering and how its a distraction however I never hear any whispering and her repeating for it to stop is more of a distraction and we tend to move slower. It seems like she is more bothered by it than anyone else in the class.","I like how Dr. [Removed] likes to share aspects of her life and always asks who we are doing / have been at the start of each lecture.","He is a great professor because unlike most other professors, he cares more about us learning than giving us competitive grades.","There is nothing else.","I feel this instructor has been very kind and understanding so far, as well as an effective teacher.","[Removed] is an amazing instructor who clearly cares about her students, both inside and outside of the classroom. She's very encouraging and represents a strong growth mentality. She's not shy to share her faults and failures during lectures to ensure the students that they're not alone, and to destigmatize the openness of one's failures. She truly is an inspiration and I hope to leave an impact on someone the way she does on her students.","There is not anything I can think of right now.","I believe the course can be a bit overwhelming with all the assignments","I would just like to say that the way he holds his lectures into questions is good and effective to me at least as it helps me utilize what I learned. This helps me remember it better for exams.","I do not feel that this is necessary for a chemistry course, there is not a lot of other historical context that is delved into due to most important chemistry discoveries being held by white men.","She's a great professor and very open to talking with her students. I like the way she presents information in lectures and how she uses instapolls during class to help us practice.","I really like the way Dr. [Removed] has structured the course. The worksheets have been great help, as I have always been the type to learn best by example. It really helps to look back on previous work. I like that we use R [Removed] instead of copying our code on a separate doc like I had to do in other classes, and I like that it is predominantly project based and \" learn as you go \". As someone with test anxiety I feel this is the best way for me to truly show my skills.","I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. Some courses need to incorporate current pop culture or other niche references, but I feel like [Removed] doesn't have as much of a place for this.","I think the teacher is good at maintaining the learning environment by ensuring that the class stays quiet.","I think [Removed] is a great professor and is very good at explaining the concepts he teaches.","I'm not a fan of having to talk to my neighbor every class. It discourages me to go because I have anxiety. I'd rather have them teach and use an interactive discussion board if that's what they want. They want us to teach each other and I believe that's the professors job.","The showing of images before every lecture whether it is a recent discovery or part of his own research is such a small detail that makes every lecture better. Takes some stress off and helps us realize that we're all important to achieving evolution as a species and that anyone can do it.","She's a great instructor and she tries. I think she could do a better job of acknowledging students questions. During an exam I had a technical question and it felt like she was avoiding me and trying to not interact with me. Also I sit in the front row and she sometimes asks students repeatedly to please stop whispering as other students are trying to learn, however I don't hear much if any noise so I just found it strange. Maybe she needs a very quiet environment to be able to peacefully lecture, which is a bit difficult in a class of over 100 students","There is not much to say other than he is a doing a good job and helping students in the course.","For me I think the fact that the professor is open to students making mistakes and helping us overcome those struggles has been refreshing. He is very helpful in office hours","Dr. [Removed] always tells her students about opportunities outside of academia- this includes orchestra concerts, food truck locations, and so much more! Dr. [Removed] truly reminds students that she is also a human and relates to us, whenever I speak to her I just know that I am accepted and appreciated.","I wish we would get more organized and less broad review content so that I could prepare deeper for relevant topics and not spend as much time on things that are going to be more surface level so I could be more productive.   I like how for chemistry we are provided specific question types and practice problems so we know what specific topics are relevant for each issue.","Professor [Removed] is very encouraging and always reminds us that it's okay if we don't pass or do well on a test.   She says it's one grade and it doesn't define us.   For me, that's very comforting, and it makes mistakes more acceptable.","This is my first time taking physics. I have never taking physics in highschool prior to this semester. This course is difficult but I believe the support that Dr. [Removed] provides is crucial for a student who found this course challenging like me. She make my experience with this course feel much better and I hope I can improve my learning and understanding of physics after the course finished.","She's been a great professor who cares a lot about her students' progress.","I wish there was more resources other than square caps and [Removed]'s","He is very understanding and smart.","I really liked talking about the applications of what learned in class. In addition whenever I ask a question the professor always makes it feel like a valid question.","So far I really enjoy Dr. [Removed]'s class, the only thing that I would recommend to improve on is the grading, sometimes on an assignment I feel like the TA's take off points for super minimal reasons that aren't even properly explained in the instructions.","Dr [Removed] is a helpful teacher when it comes to answering specific questions and explaining the contextual larger picture of what is being taught in lecture.","I would really like more short &amp; lt;5min breaks that offer icebreakers for us to talk to each other more, more specifically without any chemistry content involved.","He's a great teacher who does not strictly think in physics in order to foster a liking and understanding of physics in students, being effective in doing so.","The instructor is extremely kind and understanding. She is always open to questions and always offers to help us in any way possible. I am really enjoying this class as a result, and I look forward to it every week.","I really like the class participation that is encouraged and the peer talking. It helps break up the lecture to be more engaging.","[Removed] genuinely wants us to do the best we can and has the best demos to make lectures interesting to help us. The only thing is that I wish he would spend less time deriving equations so that we could do more complicated examples in class because the homework and the exams are much harder so being able to go through them in class would be nice.","The instructor is very accommodating and his office hours are very beneficial for doing well in the course.","This instructor was great, she'll make sure you pass the class with flying colors as long as you put the work in.","Not really just that she's a great instructor.","She is always very kind and happy to answer any questions I am curious about and it makes ecology fun to learn.","Dr. [Removed] is very friendly and professional. He once offered a cough drop to a student who was coughing loudly, and he makes little jokes every now and then. It really improves the climate of the class","Professor [Removed] does a very good job and covers a large amount of content very well. She speaks clearly and gives us everything to succeed as long as we do our part and use the material. I like the balance of lecture, interaction and talking among peers, and practice embedded into my time in her class.","The instructor enjoys a fast - moving lecture, but also slows down to help the students engage in the material. I enjoy participating in the instapolls and the handouts, as they do help me deepen my understanding by engaging.","Dr. [Removed] is very approachable and friendly which gives me the confidence to be honest with myself about the things of the course that I don't fully understand.","My instructor has been great! I think we all feel adequately prepared for our labs, and she's very knowledgeable and willing to help us if we're stuck.","My professor has made learning physics an enjoyable experience. The environment in the classroom is very welcoming and encourages participation.","Not really, this class is pretty standard and doesn't require much involvement from diverse perspectives or whatnot, since its an analytics course. There are only so many ways different perspectives can perceive data.","Dr. [Removed] is a fantastic professor. She is one of, if not the best professor when it comes to answering and explaining questions, no matter how stupid it may be. She is very patient, thoughtful, and her organization skills do not go unnoticed as it helps me manage and understand the class very well.","Professor is very open to questions and helpful in understanding difficult topics. She is usually in a pleasant mood despite it being 8:00am.","None that I can think of.","The grading policy is not clear. You may lose points for some unexpected things.","There is nothing I'd like to further share.","Dr. [Removed] overall makes the lectures interesting in the sense that he often includes real world examples and applications to help students understand the topic more deeply and provides numerous opportunities for a student to deepen their knowledge about a topic.","I think the course is easy but sometimes I feel like the professor goes too fast.","She is very inclusive and understanding. I love how patient and kind she is!","I really really wish we would spend more time in class actually solving practice problems that are exactly like the homework so that when I open the homework I'm not completely lost. I wish the lecture time was used more efficiently. He's doesn't go very in - depth in the problem solving sometimes and brushes over it. I wish he would give us a practice exam before we taken the exams to more prepare us or give us similar questions to the exam. Last time I remember a lot of the questions had topics we never discussed or barely discussed in class. I know e are supposed to be able to figure it out with our knowledge but I still would rather it be mentioned in class.","Your lectures are fantastic but so quick! I envy the way we can fit so much information in such little time ; however, at first this was a difficult adjustment. I can say that a lot of this is learning on our own, but if people listen to lectures and are willing to ask questions, it's greatly helpful. I appreciate you for answering all our questions and giving little tidbits of information to us!","I love the variety of resources we have to prepare for exams. However, I believe that my professor is not very good at time management during lectures. In my opinion, we go very in depth into the easier content from the beginning of the year, such as electron configuration, but not content that is knew to me. Comparing where we are in this unit to my friends in other [Removed] chem classes, with one lecture left before the exam, I feel like we are behind. I also feel like a lot of lecture time is wasted by her stopping class to ask us to be quiet, which is nearly impossible in a 500 person lecture. Additionally, at the beginning of lectures, we spend a lot of time going over announcements and reviewing content we've already covered, when I think most students would benefit more by not rushing through the new content at the end of class. I feel as if the only way I've been able to learn the content in this course is on my own time going through the learning modules.","The instructor is very kind and tries to make sure we grasp the fundamentals of difficult concepts during class. I appreciate how she offers her office hours and encourages us to ask questions without judgement.","i like that he is very nice and understanding","I like the way my professor teaches! I sometimes wish the in - class quizzes had more questions because there are usually 5 questions and if I miss one, I am at an 80.","I like the squarecap question polling during class. I find the problems at the beginning of class to be excitingly challenging, and I find the problems during class to be helpful in reinforcing the material of the class.","I appreciate Professor [Removed]'s willingness to be forgiving on our tests, go slow during lessons, and to provide us with as much help as she can!","I would like for them to be more engaging with the students and have more practice problems throughout.","My instructor doesn't share personal information about herself, or talk overtly about her career, which is a good thing because it keeps the class focused on the course material. It can be easy for instructors to get carried away on side tangents, so I prefer that instructors only talk about the coursework. For this course, there is a lot of information to cover and any time that would be allocated to personal information shared ( either by instructor or by students ) I feel would be better time spent going over coursework.","The most impactful thing that Dr. [Removed] has said in lecture, in my opinion, is that no question is a stupid question. No matter what question someone asks, he is happy to answer it, and always does so in a way that makes sense. This sentiment that no question is a stupid question has empowered me to speak up in this class when I am usually pretty quiet in other classes, and I am sure other students feel the same.","I like how she puts so much material out there in order to study for major exams.","I appreciated how respectful my instructor was.","I really like that you can retest 1 week after exams because it gives you the opportunity to learn more and improve. I went from a 75 to a 90 and I felt I learned the content a lot better because of the retest.","I really like Professor [Removed]'s positive attitude. She really seems to connect with us. I also like how much in - class practice she has us do, it's helpful.","The instructor really minds when there is whispering in the lecture hall. And while this is nice and she promotes a quiet environment, I find there to be many times where I don't notice any whispering and we stop class to address the small amount of whispering there is. This halt leads us to getting less information than other sections.","Dr. [Removed] is very nice and will not discriminate anybody on their smarts ; she is a great teacher and doesn't shy away from any questions.","I feel confident in my ability to succeed in the course!","I think Dr. [Removed] does a fantastic job at presenting the material needed for class and allowing enough time for in class practice and discussion.","It was such a hard course to study because the lecture did not explain the basics at all ( basic concepts, terminology, etc. ) and had all of them for the students to study by themselves through learning modules. The modules were hard to read, text - heavy were always uploaded late and required much more time commitment than the lecture. \n Also the professor didn't cover the whole materials before the exam in the lecture","I really like Dr. [Removed]! He was made for teaching [Removed].","I feel that the instructor could be more efficient in spending class time. We are always behind and this causes me to get confused often because the instructor starts to speed through all the other slides. We go through the material a little too fast and do not go in - depth on certain topics. This causes me to have to go through the lecture material after class and try to relearn it all.","I love discussion acitivities! It helps me a lot to practically apply class materials and biological concepts.","I would like a bit more review material. I asked some upperclassmen about additional review material,   and they told me that they had access to an \" orange textbook \" which had additional practice questions.","I really like [Removed]'s method of teaching. The asynchronous modules plus the review of it in class is one of my favorite methods professors teach.","I need practice exams, and he does not give anything. Also, the textbook has typos.","She is very open about her experiences and struggles. She makes everyone feel welcomed and gives us a sense of belonging.","Lectures are structured pretty well.","The instructor typically encourages us in class to work in groups which is nice because it fosters a communicative work environment.","I think I was just nervous for exam one and that the concepts were pretty fair considering what we were supposed to know.","She always posts learning modules on canvas so we can do them before class and get a better understanding of the material before lecture.","The graduate TA is great, there just isn't much opportunity for them to implement what was previously asked about.","He's a very sweet guy and he is very well - versed on the subject matter.","I am not a super fast learner, so I am not very comfortable with the in class quiz because the material is too new","Sometimes Dr. [Removed] goes really fast during lectures so sometimes it would be nice if he paused so we could have a second to write everything down.","She is very interested in the study of genetics and genuinely wants to create connections with each student, especially through memorizing names.","Very helpful with helping us understand the big picture of why we are doing what we're doing.","I do sometimes feel a bit lost in the class by the way the professor teaches. I feel that the topics are not very clear and there's not a good explanation as to why something works the way it does. Chemistry right now is my hardest class because it is difficult to understand the unit. The questions the professor asks are overall confusing and do not much information as to how to approach the question. I would enjoy more explanation on certain topics.","I really appreciate Dr. [Removed]'s efforts in explaining the material and pushing us to use our resources when studying.","I think the amount of resources and help available is very useful as if you don't pick up on how something works in a lecture, it can be easy reviewed using the resources.","He's always very enthusiastic to talk about physics and genuinely listens to people's thoughts during lecture.","he has a very strong accent so I can't understand him well","Sometimes she will make a comment in class that I think isn't necessary. I like her a lot as a professor but once or twice she s made a comment along the lines of \" women shouldn't gain weight \" or \" women don't want to gain weight \" as maybe a way of relating course material to our lives? But it's a dated sentiment and it's a bit upsetting to hear in the middle of a lecture. One time specifically I can remember is in class we we're talking about consumption efficiency and how carnivores have a higher consumption efficiency and then said something along the lines of about how predators will eat whenever possible \" which is not what we would think as people because we usually don't want to gain weight \", or something along those lines, and about how women specifically will understand. Yeah I just don't think that pushes a good ideal at all on female students we're all just there to learn not to feel bad about ourselves. Once again I love this professor and would not want her to get in trouble for this, I just think its something that should be pointed out.","She s very efficient with how she teaches and encourages students to talk to others during sharing time.","I would like to say that this course is very study heavy. Lectures are not useful. The textbook also has a bunch of mistakes and tend to give overcomplicated information or not even explain correctly. I also feel that he is not giving exactly much study materials such as practise tests or practise questions. Their is also the fact that his textbook has the squarecap and that is something that is needed, which is also his son's company, this makes it seem that it is indirectly making his students pay for his class outside of tution.","She's a really nice professor, and speaks clearly. [Removed] is a bit fast but absolutely manageable if you've viewed toe modules before class as recommended.","She has a good amount of study resources and tries her best to make the class accommodating","The lectures are very fast - paced and it is hard to understand and digest the materials.","The instructor is very kind and understanding. The teaching style however throws me off due to how what we learn in class does not correlate to what we do in lab as there is more that we are learning in lab with the short amount of time we have to complete the assignment.","The professor overall encourages a welcoming and positive learning environment.","Dr. [Removed] does an amazing job for a large lecture learning environment to keep me engaged and to follow along. She provides a variety of resources for students to study. Overall, I think the class is well structured, and the materials provided are good. The only problem I have sometimes had, is her slides she has on the board are not consistent with the slides she posts online for me to follow along. I also did not like when content on quizzes at the end of class is connected to content barely addressed right before the quiz ( I don't learn that fast ). Overall again she provides lots of opportunities and resources to do good. I really like the practice tests, and question type system she posts.","I really enjoyed the quiz format rather than multiple major exams. I feel that this is a lot more manageable.","Not particularly. It's a great class but I'm not sure if that's due to her being an amazing teacher or simply because of how the course is structured ( not sure how much control she has over that I suppose ). Either way, I am very happy with this course and would recommend to anyone who needs a science course ( if not already a requirement for their major ).","She is great! \n","Honestly, from past observations, a lot of office hours are hard to go to, like it's at inconvenient times and they get canceled and pushed back a lot when you try to make the time for it. Also, there are no practice exams or more practice to go from, the homework, square cap questions, and discussion worksheets are nice, but they make me feel unprepared for upcoming assignments.","I love how accessible all the materials are, because I'm definitely someone who likes to go in and flesh out my notes after lectures, and Dr. [Removed] is really great about updating material according to what we've done in class. I also appreciate that the Learning Modules don't lock until the day of the test because I like being able to go back and read over the information there.","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind instructor who genuinely cares about her students. She sends out encouraging messages that help me feel better about the difficulty of learning genetics and helps to encourage me to continue. However, because of the limited amount of time during class, it can be hard to get clarifications on questions and lecture materials because there's only so much time we can spend on them. This leads to questions not being fully answered on our practice problems on [Removed].","I like that the instructor goes through why certain answers are right or wrong instead of just naming the right and wrong answers and moving on.","he's just awesome","No, I feel he is a lovely man and a great professor.","No, nothing specific","Not at this time.","I feel like it's difficult when professors assume that everyone already knows stuff about the content. It's kind of defeating when you actually don't know anything about it. Sometimes when people asks questions and are confused about the content, she says that it's easy and doesn't see how they're confused about the content but for most people, this is their first experience to this content which makes them feel stupid.","I believe that my lab instructor, [Removed] creates a really comfortable environment where everyone is not intimidated to ask questions or answer questions. I appreciate their efforts to help us with our experiments and make sure everything goes smoothly. I also really appreciate them created a shared playlist everyone can add to, to play in the background of the lab","I do not like the way my professor lectures. For an upper division course, I would expect her lecturing skills to be more polished. My [Removed] chem professors lecture at a better pace than her and explain things better","I want this course to have better slides and lecture material as most of the course is self - guided. I would also appreciate it if the textbook was revised as there are so many mistakes in it and for the price that it is sold to students it is horrendous that that quality is what we are receiving. The textbook needs to be better written and have quality content rather than confusing students with the lack of cohesiveness. The most helpful things in this class have been my TA and his notes as they prepare me for the exams as the Professor does not release practice tests or ways to study for the exam.","I think the instructor should work a little harder at making class interesting with real - world examples that reference pop culture if she is able to.","I would say that Professors [Removed] [Removed] and [Removed] [Removed] are good chemistry teachers. They each have different approaches to how they teach but I would recommend either.","Not at the moment!","The class is just very large and virtually impossible to know everyone on a personal or even name basis, but this is definitely made up for by the TA's in the discussion section. If you have a good TA you are more likely to be better prepared when the exams come around.","There is nothing else I would like to add.","She's really nice but it condescending sometimes when people ask questions. She'll ask us if we have any questions and he first response is well did you read the textbook if you reply yes then she goes well it's really easy. Then proceeds to answer your questions. Other than that she is kind and willing to help but when you get talked to like that it makes you feel like you can't ask questions.","Love professor [Removed], she teaches very well and gives a nice vibe to the class, would likely consider being an LA / TA for her as I feel she teaches very well and is very lenient in coursework","I find that having to complete learning modules as homework is extremely helpful in the course because it is nice to be introduced to new concepts individually ( at your own pace ) and then get to listen to [Removed]'s lectures about that specific topic the next day and really understand it better than before.","He is super funny and likeable which makes learning fun","He is very helpful and always guides you to the answer without actually giving it, which allows us to think and get to the answers on our own which helps us actually learn.","She is a very sweet professor and will help you out in whatever you need! If you don't understand something, she and the TAs jump to help you out. She teaches with lots of examples, which for me, is the best thing!","She is a very approachable and understanding instructor. She is very open to answering questions and always checks in to make sure we are understanding what she is teaching. I really like how the course is structured! It's straightforward and informative!","We typically stay on task with the curriculum and stay focused during class.","I wish she would spend more time fully explaining topics as if we have no prior experience, rather than just brushing over it slightly and teaching things as if we already know what we're doing. Even though we have learning modules, I learn better when I'm being taught in person.","Dr. [Removed] is very understanding and willing to help students who are struggling in class. Although the class can be difficult, he does not make it unnecessarily difficult on purpose and only wants to see his students learn and succeed.","The lectures and the textbook information ( which we are told to study both ) are not consistent with each other! I am unsure of what will be on exams ; all the unclear information can be very overwhelming sometimes :( There is a lot of information, all from different places. Lectures tend to be all over the places sometimes. Dr. [Removed] is a very good teacher in the sense that he is very knowledgable, but sometimes I feel I am not actually getting the material because of the way he is teaching and it goes very fast and it does not align with his textbook sometimes.","Dr. [Removed] is a wonderful instructor and she has made the [Removed] Science class really fun and engaging!!","One thing that makes this class more difficult is that the instructor kind of just reads through some of the slides rather than actually explaining why things are how they are.","Well, it's a class of nearly 100 + people from the looks of it in a lecture hall, with only an hour and a half of class time, with only 2 days of actually visiting. It should not be the fault of the instructor who has done their job well of educating who they need to, but if the university is looking for a more \" inclusive and positive \" experience, it requires actually giving physical closeness and opportunities where learning one another's names at all is a possibility. I'm sure it's not convenient, but as the greatest university in the country, if you * want * to make the experience to fit that criteria, you either commit, or work to improve the system we currently have.","She is a very kind professor who always ensures that her students are doing well not only academically but mentally as well. She thoroughly explains concepts and always patiently answers questions during class.","Professor [Removed] sometimes asks us how our weekends were, how our week is going, and likes to make some conversation with outside of the content we are focusing on in class.","I think Dr. [Removed] is amazing professor, but I do think he could help in making the material slightly easier to understand. I have talked to my peers and a group of us do think that he does run through the material rather fast, which is understandable, but tends to not elaborate on what he is talking about in words that people without background knowledge would understand. He does go very in depth and it is very evident that he loves what he does which really helps me stay engaged.","The first week could've been slowed done a little it went kind of fast for new material, but since then we have moved at a good pace.","She is great. Very smart and a great explainer, provides us with the materials we need to do well and is a very kind and genuine lady.","The instructor goes through questions students have throughout lectures and at the end when they are posted on square caps, which i found helpful and interactive.","Being in Professor [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] course, I have found that we are not able to learn from our mistakes, instead I feel as though I must know the material perfectly. I feel as though I am not growing as a student who is able to understand statistics.","[Removed] is a great TA and is very patient","In my experience I haven't learned much from going to the actual lecture, Dr. [Removed] spends more time talking about big theory's or ideas that won't be on our tests, and the stuff that we actually need to know she always says \" we will talk more about it later \" and we do its just we talk about it like 3 classes later, but in order to do our homework's and do well on the quizzes you need to know the information. So I spend most of my time teaching the topics to myself. I will say she has great resources for outside of class, there are at least 3 separate office hours each day, and lots of extra practice and review that we can do. At the beginning of the school year I would get super worried after I left the lecture and understood nothing, now I just accept it and realize I have to learn most of the material myself.","Sometimes I feel that the lectures don't exactly match up with what is on the homework, as people often ask a bunch of questions that aren't related to the topic, which often leads to tangents unrelated to the content.","The instructor created a very welcoming environment. He made it very clear that he was available to ask for help. He had a good amount of office hours and catered well to the students who needed assistance.","He kind of just jumps into problems with the assumption that we know most of the math concepts beforehand, which can sometimes leave me feeling a bit confused.","I do really like Dr. [Removed], I wish we had a smaller class so I would be able to get to know her personally.","I really enjoy Dr. [Removed]' classes. Her classes are one of the few that I feel like I actually learned from because she uses active learning and she provides us with the proper materials to study for exams. I can tell by the way she teaches that she is passionate about helping others learn and sharing knowledge. Even if her classes make you put in a little more effort than others, I think the output of the course is much greater than most.","Dr. [Removed] is great! She's honestly very motivating, supportive, empathetic, and truly wants her students to succeed. I only wish she explained her lectures in more detail. Because of COVID-19, not all students have the strongest background in chemistry. It kind of feels like she just skims the slides during the lecture, so I find myself having to do a lot of self - teaching.","I appreciated the reflection","I really enjoy that the professor breaks down the formulas we use and how to apply them.","Nothing else to share.","She is very empathetic and humble. She is extremely relatable and kind.","I'd like to be more aware of what specifically students make mistakes with and how I can improve not making them.","My professor does not take questions from students.","I think Professor [Removed] does an excellent job with [Removed] [Removed] His lectures are generally interesting and are well connected to previous content covered. He seems to understand that not everyone will immediately grasp a concept ; during in class [Removed] quizzes, he drops hints to guide our thinking. With the example of [Removed] quizzes, my previous physics instructor ( [Removed] 303 K ) did not provide any guidance, and the quizzes were more heavily weighted on being correct, which ultimately led to confusion, the feeling that I wasn't learning, and even resenting some of the course content. \n\n Otherwise, Professor [Removed] is very approachable. I've asked a few questions myself and have been satisfied with his responses, and I've not seen him answer a question in a way that belittles or embarrasses a student. I feel that Professor [Removed] and the students both understand that [Removed] [Removed] can be rather difficult.","I really enjoy how Dr. [Removed] goes out of his way to make sure his students understand the concepts.","She goes through material well and does not rush through anything.","For me, a lot of information is repeated to the point where I think it's redundant. However, many of my peers will ask questions that make it seem like they don't understand certain concepts. I might try and find more ways to explain each concept in the course in order to make teaching the material more efficient.","I think Dr. [Removed] gives us so many resources to study which is the key to success in this class.","He is so personable, and I really enjoy his class. My TA, [Removed], is incredibly helpful. She is AMAZING at her job, and I credit her with helping me get comfortable with college level biology.","I like how much resources my professor gives me for the exams. I just wished she went more in depth with the lectures and doesn't just go over what's already on the slides. I feel like I always need to reteach myself what she taught during the lectures instead of her teaching me.","I enjoy the active learnings and the practice problems in the lectures.","I still love her tho, its ok if she doesn't share her personal life.","N / [Removed] The instructor has been great so far.","Dr. [Removed] is a very positive person who is great at breaking down problems to a more manageable bite. Additionally, his emphasis on an open mindset helps support students through the hard parts of the course.","I think the amount of work in this course is unnecessary. It could be reduced without changing the overall learning experience. It is a 2 hour course with 4 hours of lab a week and at least 2 hours worth of additional assignments per week.","I appreciate the instructor for his willingness to hear our opinion, which is more rare than you'd think! I personally enjoy the structure of the course and how it is applied to our homework and exams as it is due to the natural correlation and the fact it does help us in our deep understanding of the content.","I appreciate that the instructor makes an effort to discuss with students during lectures ( through lecture handouts to be done in groups ), rather than simply talking / lecturing at us.","He goes through information quickly which makes it hard to keep up, but he is approachable to ask questions.","more worksheets and video examples","I appreciate his flexibility and kindness","the class is very quickly paced and i feel the structure could be slowed down for student success.","She's nice but the class is going very fast","I feel like there are an excessive amount of out - of - lab assignments that I feel could be done during class.","Dr. [Removed], this year, included the 25 question types and review notes which has guided me on my studying and really helped me learn which areas of the material to focus on.","Overall, Dr. [Removed] is a great teacher! I like how she encourages collaboration instead of competition. This way, students don't feel anxious when asking questions. I also like how the teams can help us explain concepts to each other.","he is really cool, i like his demos and he has a sense of humor that a lot of professors lack nowadays. He does goes very fast but his instapolls help a bit to understand the materials","Nothing else except I wish the quizzes were easier. Having multiple prelabs with [Removed] of possible questions seems like busy work.","Dr. [Removed] is very caring and understanding. She emphasizes mental health and provides a safe environment to learn physics.","No, I really like her though. She is very welcoming and very fair. I like her method of [Removed].","The instructor is very knowledgable on the content, but sometimes explains difficult concepts quickly or in confusing terms. I am not sure if other students feel similarly.","She does a great job!","I think sometimes she's just reading off of the slides and marking things that aren't necessary. Before our test, she had two lectures where she mainly went over electron configuration, which I personally do not find to be that difficult of a topic, and felt as though the time could be allotted to things much more difficult.","I can tell how much effort has gone into setting up the curriculum for this class! And prof. [Removed] is so kind and patient :)","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind professor. He provides informative lectures in addition to very helpful office hours. My struggle with the course lies in understanding what the correct formula / approach is for a problem. I feel like the material before the first exam was better explained than the material currently, as I am now starting to have issues with formula identification. I may just require more exposure to the material."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>instructor_id<\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.course_additional<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"instructor_id","targets":1},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":2},{"name":"or.course_additional","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Also I will mention that they can present their project to the city of [Removed] if they are putting efforts in their research, showing that they can contribute meaningfully to their local community.","For each lecture I make sure to break the lecture up into segments so that students can talk to their neighbors about the material. This can be for more formal situations like doing an [Removed] question, but I also have students talk to their neighbors as I lecture through the material particularly when I know the concept in question can be confusing. I have students talk to their neighbors to check to see if they are both clear on the topic.","After midterm2 when I showed the results and the class distribution I emphasized that students should be proud of themselves for how they are doing so far and encouraged them to keep the momentum going through the rest of the semester.","While ensuring I cover all the appropriate course material, I want to include real - world examples during class. For example, in Gas Laws coming up, there are a lot of applications, such as [Removed] diving and hot air balloons. I see this tactic as one where I can tie in student interests ( like pre - health majors ), as well. I will think on how the upcoming topics can tie to medicine.","This seems like a good point to add in the post [Removed] debrief to ensure I include a positive aspect   to that process. \n\n Along the lines of \" This is a challenging course and you as a class have learned a significant amount of material in a short time period and should be proud of yourselves for your accomplishments so far. Make sure to take a moment to reflect on what is working well in your study strategies and commit to building on those habits as we enter the final stretch of the course. \"","When students are asked to complete the Course [Removed] [Removed], I send out an email encouraging them to fill out the survey.   I explain that I use this feedback to improve the student learning experience.","I am using reflections on my content assessments to learn whether the resources available in the course are helpful for student learning and what else we can do to help their learning.","Using instapolls during the class, pausing before and after solving an example in the class, constantly encouraging them to share their questions","Will discuss my sports and my [Removed] favorites. \n\n\n If there were 3 items, I'd fill in when, words, but for 14, c'm on!","I will provide a mid - semester survey to all of my students and discuss in class how I've used it in the past and what I will do when I read their responses.   I also share common themes during a following class that gives them an idea of what I gathered from their responses.   I will do this in a couple of weeks.","This is what we do everyday in class and for every assignment!","I will mention to students that with practice they are all capable of doing well in the course.","When we release the first quiz grades, I will spend time in class showing students the most frequently missed questions.","At the end of each week of lab, students are asked to interpret results from experiments and provide an explanation for the results they recorded during the week.   Here is an example question on their 11 - 8 Research Report Assignment on [Removed] : \n\n Where your results expected or unexpected?   Why?   What do these results tell you about the bacteria in your soil sample?","Send an email to students who did poorly on their first midterm exam. \n I already did it in one course. I'll do the same with two other class sections of another course after their grades are released. \n I know you can improve and grow with effort no matter how you did on this exam. This is just one snapshot of your performance in this class, but we need to have the right strategies moving forward.","I give ample wait time in class. I specifically ask students to think to themselves sometimes before asking for a volunteer to answer","I include pictures and a research question that we use the statistical analysis method to answer for each example they see in class.   The course packet also contains a set of problems that show how the methods we learn can be used to answer real - world data analysis questions.","I ask \" what are your questions? \" and then have a long pause, frequently during class.   I also specifically ask for suggestions or answers to questions that I pose from students who haven't talked yet that day or that week.","I not only mention to students the times that the instructional team is available throughout the week, but I make it clear that we are there to help them learn the material and that we are happy to help them.","Students generally didn't do very well on Midterm 2, so I had students do a shorter ( new ) Midterm 2 a few days later for the opportunity to earn back half the points that they missed. I mentioned to students that we will do a retake instead of just curving the scores because what is important is the learning of the material, which they can demonstrate by doing another exam.","There is graphical or numerical data in each of my lessons. \n I do emphasize the importance of these models. \n The next few week is mellow, but in week 6 - 7 by the end of the week, we will be covering models of delayed density dependence, which reqires abstract thinking. \n\n I usually explain why mathematical models are important to understand the physical world and to make prediction","I have new questions in my in - class quizzes where the students get 3 minutes to talk to eachother","Students work together in class and with assignments. They share ideas in discussion posts, have a team facilitation assignment, and connect with their peers as they instruct them once a semester.","Students receive a check in every week. They can provide feedback on their weekly assignments or overall class composition.","Students are directed to reach out to the teaching team in a timely manner to discuss the issue. I try to work with student schedules to facilitate make - up exams whenever possible. For homeworks, I had [Removed] create a token system where any student can give themselves a 24 hour extension on assignments up to three times per semester.","I have polling questions in every class. \n I provide the correct answer and address misconceptions as they arise ( from poll histograms )","Most of my classes do not have any individual timed assignments and my materials are accessible so the only way students usually use their accommodations is with flexible deadlines. I will make sure that they know they can submit their assignments a little later if that would improve the quality of the work they turn in.","  When we covered population dynamics ( week 7 ) and pathogen - host interactions ( week 9 ), I emphasized how the models we cover are the basic models that are used by the [Removed] ( Center for Disease Control ) and the [Removed] Modeling Consortium and other public health institutes. Seeing that many students are pre - health, this connects directly to their careers.","I use [Removed] booking for [Removed] students","The resources has been introduced on syllabus, reminding the students about them about mid - semester, using office hours to talk to students about the activities","I use examples provided in the book. My goal is to incorporate current examples I see in social media but it has been difficult to do so this semester to have time to do so.","As we start digging into more challenging materials, I will have more time for students to think independently on how to use code to achieve what we want to get. After some independent thinking, I will ask them to share with a partner.","By using the reasults from the first [Removed] survey","The course is framed as a class that is designed for them to succeed in their transition to college.

They have an opportunity to debrief on the readings, share their thoughts and opinions, and present experiences from their own life as it relates to the topic or reading at hand.","I take attendance with [Removed] [Removed] but more importantly it gives me an opportunity to know where everyone is at during lecture. I use a mix of open - ended questions and multiple choice questions.","Along with the group work in class, I recommend to students to work on homework assignments together.   Also, students must complete lab assignments in assigned groups each week.","We will have the second midterm soon, I would like to run through the problems that students struggled with the most and work through them to identify common mistakes and how to avoid them in future exams and assignments.","In some sense this survey is giving them an opportunity to provide feedback and is an important element of our initiative this semester. \n\n I would also like to add some targeted in class instapoll queries after the second midterm that can also provide an opportunity to get a sense of the state of the class.","I provide a link in my canvas home page with access to the different arrays of resources available at the university. This is also mentioned in my syllabus.","We have let students know to reach out for late assignments or missed assignments. When this happen, students are not penalized for submitting assignments late if they reach out. Words that I have told students are : \" We are not here to penalize you and your grade. We know things happen. Please reach out if you have to submit an assignment late and we can figure out what can be done in reopening assignments \".","Shared a belonging story about how I dropped out of law school because it wasn't a good fit for me.","Most days in class for my large intro course I try to highlight at least one real world aspect of the physics we are learning. Often this can be small examples of similar systems to what they're seeing in a demonstration.","We shared with students that they need to apply situations to things and topics that they may not have covered, especially at students studying different areas. We let them know this often in class through their introduction to educational topics.","I try to wait several seconds after asking questions during lecture and ask for students across different areas in the classroom to participate in the question answers.","We have not had the opportunity yet to tackle this issue in [Removed] [Removed] in terms of mistakes I may have made when lecturing. I do tackle students' misconceptions weekly.","always make sure to encourage them to work on the instapolls and examples together before I myself discuss","Share the results of students' prosocial purpose writing activity \n In the upcoming week \n Thank you for writing about your prosocial purpose and helping me learn about you. I enjoyed reading your reflections and want to share some insights.","Students were given a lot of feedback in their assignments in a way that wasn't punitive. Always in a way were they could share their ideas and feel like they can authentically share without feeling like it might impact their grade.","Check - in question about students music interests. \n Quiz - questions about medical application of [Removed] concepts","Using real - life examples","I use a getting to know you activity at the beginning of the course that allows students to express their interests. They present this activity to their peers in discussion and I also get to read their responses and try to provide comments in their assignment. This semester, I have not been able to provide comments yet.","I use [Removed] to gauge students' understanding of the material. I typically give students one or two questions per class and I show students the results ( in terms of a poll that shows the distribution of student responses ).","All of circuits, magnetism, [Removed], [Removed] waves have good applications, \n filters / tuners, motors / generators, sensors, antennas...","During class, if a particular topic was explained, but I knew it was more challenging, I would emphasize the importance of office hours for more individualized instruction. It can be difficult to assess if such a large group of students is understanding each topic, and it's usually mixed. I've stated during class, as much as felt natural, that I would love to talk to them more in my office hours.","When discussing climate change and range shift due to climate shift, I used a paper by [Removed] [Removed] - a former [Removed] professor - now world renowned for her work on butterfly range shifts due to climate change. \n\n","I talked about a running race that I participated in the weekend before.    It was about 2/3 of the way through the sememster when students are really struggling.    I talked them through my mindset during races.    \" I actively remind myself during the race about remembering how hard the course is and how my body if feeling in the moment.

I thought it was important to take a moment to have students reflect ( and share with their neighbors ) a problem in the world that they would like to solve because it was personal to them. Then I had them think about the fact that many of the problems that they identified were in fact difficult problems to solve.","We shared that their experiences brought them to [Removed] [Removed] for a reason. That they are capable of succeeding and that they will be successful post - first year of study. This encouragement was shared weekly and in [Removed] messaging.","We talk about learning strategies.    TA reach out to students who have missed the class to help them make up the attendance.","I have suggested useful youtube modules to review math skill needed in this class","Focused on application of methods to answering real research questions based on their interests.   I've done this during lecture and on assignments.","Working through old exam problems in class","Since students are developing new skills, possibly in a topic where they are not interested in, they were told that the skillsets they were learning in class was to improve their overall experience at [Removed]. It was always presented as a benefiting of skills as the goal of the class.","Ha, I plan to use the survey - explaining that its use us to help evaluate the practices in this course.","In class I ask them to think how their own life reflects topics we study in ecology. \n\n E.g. [Removed] 5 : \n \" How does living in group ( with room mates ) has both costs and benefits. \" \n I.e. in behavioral ecology, we study cost and benefits of group living for animal species, and how the net benefit results in the optimum group size. \n\n E.g. [Removed] 10 : \n  \" What are resources that you have in your day - to - day life? \" \n I.e. resources are shared and can be used up by others. This is an importamt concept in ecology when we study intra and inter specific competition. They always have great suggestions : place on the bus, in the fridge, clean eating bowls,... \n","Between the two [Removed] surveys, I told students I first thought how it would replace my mid semester survey, but that it did not quite meet those expectations, e.g. I did not have feedback on my start - stop - continue questions. \n\n Therefore I launched my usual mid - semester feedback survey. \n I analyzed the resulsts and shared those with them. \n I specifically looked at the start - stop - continue answer, listed them, tallied them and responded in groups of suggestions : \n - policies / practices that are already in place, but students might have missed ( e.g. leniency in [Removed] grade ) \n - policies / practices that I immediately implemented ( e.g. practice exams without the key visible ) \n - policies / practices that seem good, but can not be implemented due to too many demands on our class time ( e.g. practice exams explained in class ) \n - policies   / practices that I can not implement in the same semester due to syllabus statements or pedagogical reasons. ( e.g. different exam policies ) \n\n I shared the survey results and analysis with students in an announcement and pointed out some changes at the beginning of class.","Since last survey, there have been two new assignments where students have to chose their own topic aligned with their interest areas. \n\n They have been introduced to the two new assignments in week 9 of the semester. \n Because these are both group assignments, students were asked to brainstorm about both assignments in week 9 and record on paper their own interests, and then decide as a group, within the realm of possibilities for their assignment. \n\n The tricky part is that the assignments are aligned with learning outcomes as well, and therefore they can not just pick anything that they're interested in. \n\n [Removed] Note 2 is aligned with [Removed] related to biodiversity, so students are asked to compare biodiversity in e.g. space ( e.g. their hometowns, major cities,... ) or ime,   or within taxa that they're interested in. E.g. many biology students have an interest in pollinators or birds or reptiles etc. \n I did have to give some feedback to students hat their chosen topic did not address biodiversity. E.g. you can study biodiversity of birds, but not biodiversity of only grackles. That might have been perceived as a negative by some student groups. \n\n [Removed] Note 3 is aligned with the LOs of the course that relate to landscape ecology and conservation biology. Students were asked to pick a topic within this realm, but many suggestions were not at all within this realm. I also gave some advice and suggestions on this. Again, this might have been perceived as a negative by some student groups. \n\n","We are going to use [Removed] to play a game about what courses are required for degrees and what majors there are in [Removed].","This semester I will be showing a few videos of people talking about how they learned from their mistakes. I also state this during class from time to time. When discussing a problem solving strategy I talk to students about how they may make mistakes when approaching a certain problem, but that is a valuable learning experience that will help them later in solving future problems.","Literally sending them this survey.","All students had the experience to work with a peer outside of class at least once for the semester.","Students work in small groups ( 3 - 4 students ) to design and conduct experiments.   They work together to collect a soil sample, conduct experiments, and then present their results together at the end of the semester.   Students also use [Removed] to discuss ( on an app ) ethical issues.","When appropriate, I will talk about my research as a grad student at [Removed].   I recently told a group' When I was grad student, my advisor told me that 50 % of my experiments would fail for some reason or another. I spent a year trying to infect a plant with a fungus and never succeeded in making that happen.'   I don't always say this to student groups- just those students who seem frustrated when they are having issues growing their bacteria.","We are having a final project that reflects how physics impacts their lives. I will begin to talk about this in 2 weeks.   I will discuss how the project is meant to reflect their lives and how they see physics as useful, impactful or just fun,","Students are hesitant to ask question, I usually encourage them to discuss it with their neighbors, talking to each other before sharing the question with rest of the class is very helpful to students","I told the students a bit about me at the beginning of the semester.    Every week I try to talk about something that was hard for me to do.    I am planning to do it again in the middle of the semester.","Policy : contact me directly for additional acommodations","Each day in my large lecture course, students receive 1 - 3 questions where they work with their neighbors and Learning Assistants to interpret and solve the problem. Its an essential component of learning in my introductory courses.","We shared the opportunity to talk bout things that they didn't understand during office hours and class. Always ensuring students that the goal of learning topics was to relate it to their life, not to become experts.","Using office hours to encourage them","I do this every class, as I ask them to guide me through solving problems.","We are doing this by using [Removed] [Removed] during lecture. So far, I have not used instapoll in every lecture. I am planning to use it more often in future lectures.","Since we are only at a third of the semester, there is still plenty of time for students to succeed. I will collect the information about what they feel they could improve on and will summarize what they said and share it with the class with my own advice as well.","I have designed [Removed] 206L so that students have a chance to learn a technique ( and make mistakes ) and then, the following week, they conduct the experiment ( and hopefully not make mistakes ).   I emphasize, whenever possible, that making mistakes is a natural part of learning, and that students are not penalized for making mistakes.   Students are given the opportunity to practice a variety of techniques such as serial dilutions, microscopy, Gram - staining, and [Removed] and gel electrophoresis before they use the techniques to examine their soil bacteria.","Besides the [Removed] survey, I will also ask students to complete a midterm survey to collect information about how they currently feel about the course, what aspects helped them learn so far, if they have any suggestions for improving the course this semester, and what they could do themselves to better succeed in this course ( still plenty of time for improvement! ).","I emphasize the course structure that includes Replacement Exams, vs. a cumulative final exam. Students can learn from their first time taking an exam on Unit 1 material, for example, and then replace that exam grade at the end of the semester. Students can learn from past mistakes and misconceptions, and conquer the Unit 1 material the second time around.","Provide and encourage extra problem resources","During office hours I let the students and encourage them to answer each other questions","In [Removed] [Removed], students interpret data when I present certain concepts using graphs. They also interpret mathematical models when we talk about [Removed] [Removed] equilibrium equation, logistic and exponential population growth. \n I usually start the lecture mentioning that we will cover the mathematical component of the course. In addition, I try to convey to students that mathematical models are working hypothesis that use numbers instead of words to convey ideas.","Invited students to participate in survey and providing extra credit / bonus","I have students turn and talk to their neighbors regularly throughout class to discuss narrow specific questions. They also engage in active learning around primarily conceptual problems 1 - 3 times per 50 minute lecture.","We connect students with campus resources. They are encouraged to connect with mentors so that they can ask questions about college or their related field.","I usually give students a few minutes to write down their thoughts or derivations before demonstrating it myself. I give i - clicker questions and ask students to discuss among themselves before asking for students to volunteer their answers.","I plan to share with students that is nice to have a professional plan but realize that these plans can change and this is fine. \n I would like to do this in the coming weeks ( if time allows as this course is content heavy ) \n I am not sure yet which words I will use.","The course uses materials developed by the [Removed] [Removed] Program, an international effort to discover antibiotic - producing bacteria.   Students learn about the antibiotic resistance crisis and test their soil isolates for resistance to antibiotics.","I'm patient with Instapolls","They are offered a second try at each midterm exam.   The second try occurs 2 days after the first so it is fresh in their minds. I always tell them between tries that fixing mistakes is a great way to learn.   Also, the two tries reduces test anxiety.   Everyone has bad days... Personal stories.","Instapolls, typically 2 - -7 questions per class.","Tutorials, links to other sites","Students can redo exam problems using a specific structured problem solving approach to earn 1/2 of the missed points back.","We introduce the class to topics of diversity, as it relates to communities and educational systems. For example, they cover the [Removed] racial geography tour as well as take a community walk in the local schools in [Removed].","In my notecard assignment and in the first week, I required students to get to know each other and find things in common.

And that they can improve on the next one.","Welcome and share mistakes. \n In informal Q&amp;A \n Thank you for sharing your thoughts. While this is a common misconception, it reveals our thinking and helps us learn from our mistakes. I make similar mistakes as well.","Notes are posted online, with listed topics, as well as extra problem help.","Gave students time to complete a values writing activity before we discussed career exploration.   Pointed out how careers that align with one's values tend to be satisfying and that many people change careers or majors during college or during their lifetime.   Showed resources from [Removed] Career Services about the many careers that one can pursue with a science major and told personal story about the three different careers that I've experienced.","Show a graph of the number of mutations plotted against the parent's age \n Upcoming week \n I want you to look at this graph and think silently about the prompts shown before answering. \n","After exams, and this time in class after the second exam, gave directions to students on how to evaluate if their learning methods were effective.","In my syllabus there is explicit text on how I handle missed / late work due to emergencies. I also individually check with students that have missed significant assignments. \n I usually ask them if everything is going well and that I am concerned about them.","When we talk about study stratigies we discuss working with classmates.    I openly ask the group if anyone wants to share things that work for them to share with the class.","By sending reminders about scheduled office hours / TA and LA help sessions and repeating it once in 2 weeks at least to make sure they are aware, also emphasizing on availability outside of those scheduled times in case it has conflict with their schedule","I tell my students about my own experience of failure and growth","Students have handouts and polling questions in every class period where they work with each other to complete the handout. \n Sometimes there is silence at the start when they're thinking independently, but I always encourage them to check with their neighbors / peers /friends. \n\n","Actually, this is not related to this particular project, but a different project. \n I am using muddiest point polls every week to assess what students perceive as difficult and create a handout / study guide for those topic. It's one way in which instructors can use AI in teaching. \n\n I do this every week. Polls are open Monday - Wednesday for content from the previous week. \n I create the handout by Friday. \n I need to prompt them to review the materials and give details on what they did not understand. \n E.g. if I have spent three lectures on' competition' and they just say' competition' it's hard to know what they don't understand.","Readings are mostly new to students, They are always applying knowledge that they have not covered in their reflections and other assignments.

Please discuss this problem with your team before we go over it together.","Over the course of the semester, students work together to build a Research Poster that they will present to the class at the end of the semester.   Here are the instructions I provide them : \n\n Your group will present your research at the end of the semester using a poster.   A poster is a visual communication tool that allows you to present your research in a clear, concise, graphic format.   A poster can be created at any stage of your research project.   In fact, creating a poster can aid in focusing your research.   A link to the [Removed] Templates you should use to create your Final Poster are on the [Removed] Page of [Removed].","Ask [Removed] questions about the content \n In each class \n Say the question on the slide as is or rephrase the question","We talk about all of the different CNS majors in this course.   Specifically during our advising courses.","For every problem I do in class, we \" check the answer \" by trying to interpret the meaning of the answer. Sometimes I do it for them, sometimes I have the class provide answers. In office hours I make every student do this for every problem.","When we get a bit further on, I can use specific examples like teaching about sound using music examples.","I do this in class when I am encouraging reticent students to participate in answering and asking questions","By using examples and showing how the skills which was used to solve physics problem can be used to address the real life challenges like job hunting / graduate school applications","I have consistently shared applications to my research or other research I am aware of. The first survey indicated that some students found this to be engaging and effective so I made a point of including several specific examples over the last few weeks, specifically a superconducting bearing and [Removed] circuits used as detectors. I typically walked through the application of the class amterial to the research along with visual aids.","Retest for Exam 2 ( since fits survey ). \n Did it on October 21. \n \" Exam 2 score will be replaced by Exam [Removed] score if it is better. \"","For example, today we were discussing specific forces like tension and the normal force, so to set up the discussion I showed students a video of the current record for skydiving as a way to get them to visualize forces that not only a skydiver experiences, but the forces that we experience in everyday life. During the lecture, I mentioned during two worked - out problems how doing the problem will help them figure out a real - world application in that they can calculate the forces involved when they may need to hang an object from their ceiling.","I have a some check - in questions where students reflect on their learning strategies","In every class, there were a few times I asked the students to work on a problem with their neighbors.   Occasionally I'd say the best way to learn is from your friends.","[Removed], every single day, 1 - 4 times.","The whole course is centered on how students can conduct authentic, relevant research, and how their work contributes to the ongoing battle against antibiotic resistant bacteria.   This is discussed in the syllabus.   During the first week of lab, students read articles and watch videos that emphasize this.","Most assignments for this course are based on their educational experiences that have led them to this point in their lives as freshman at [Removed] [Removed]. They share their stories and the stories of their families as it relates to their education experience, while reflecting on frameworks that they received throughout this course. Ultimately, assignments focus on their personal and professional development as well as their career pathways.","In [Removed] [Removed], students spend the entire semester studying soil bacteria to learn more about the soil microbiome as well as determine whether soil isolates are resistant to antibiotics or producing antibiotics.   They are also learning fundamental lab techniques like [Removed] and microscopy.   I hope that students recognize that their understanding of these topics and mastery of these techniques are allowing them to contribute to meaningful research.","I make time to remind students of services like the physics coaching tables, teaching team drop - in hours, and [Removed]. Since we just finished the first midterm, [Removed] is particularly important to bring up for assistance with studying or note taking services.","Retest for each of 3 exams, my main [Removed] thing","During lectures I connect the topics to life science applications. I mention to students how the basic physics that we are learning can be used to model more complex systems like the human body as most students in my classes are doing a degree in the life sciences.","After each exam, I try to share a personal story, using the belonging stories structure, with the students. So there will be at least 3 of these. I am not sure what story I will tell since I decide based on the feel of the class at the time. I will use language motivated by the belonging stories.","We have weekly challenges that promote students to use campus resources.    There was an assignment during registration week that required a student use a campus resource and answer 4 questions about it.    I reminded them about the assignment every week in class to give them ample time to complete it.","I have talked about difficulties I had as an undergraduate in first - semester mechanics, and in the syllabus ( and a linked video ) I talk about difficulties I had in grad school.","After the second midterm I spoke to students as burgeoning professionals who will have to solve problems, an essential skills developed in introductory physics courses.","Everyday in class I have students work with their neighbors on a handful of formative assessments that I pose to them. I specifically mention to students that they should talk to their neighbors to help each other learn the material better.","We give students activities and class discussions with opportunities for students to think and process. There are no right or wrong answers, and they do not get penalized if they don't participate nor receive extra points if they do.","Assigning a group project to collaborate with their peers to learn about a career they are interested in and talk to someone about the same to submit a report.","When we talk about career exploration, I talk about how I have encountered people in these professions.    I also talk about my own personal experience working.    I do this when there is a time in class, but we did have a class all about career pathways.","I started the class by pointing to the very beginning of my syllabus where I go into how I believe that everyone can learn physics. I repeat this message from time to time in class where I state that students can be successful with work and a bit of time.","I sent a congratulations message to students after their second exam that showed significant improvement of many students. I also said one day in class that we have come a long way since the beginning of the semester and learned much about genetics. \n October \n My message : Most students improved, some by large and others by smaller, but any upward change is an improvement and an occasion to celebrate! Do not compare yourself to others but focus on your own progress. Do not get discouraged if you're not satisfied with your performance but feel free to see me or any TA.","Students always had the opportunity to provide feedback, through office hours and being open and inviting during class.","I am not sure how I will approach this yet. For me the word meaningful is not as important. I would rather prioritize what they want to accomplish in the future while acknowledging that there are many different paths that can be followed.","When students reach out via email and/or in - person that something has happened, preventing them from attending class, taking an in - class quiz, or showing up for an exam, I work with a main TA to help convey next available steps. We have an email template, and I provide a time between the last class and the final exam to make up class exams if University - approved documentation is received. There are also a number of in - class polling and quiz drops to help account for students' life circumstances.","Students just finished midterm 1. I will return [Removed] paortion of the exam today. \n  I will make an announcement in class about grades and also about the effect of significant life challenges on grades.   However, I do not wish for students to come forward at that time to ask for re - dos because of significant challenges. I already did provide multiple opportunities to take the exam early / late \n\n\n\n \" I know Exam 1 might have been challenging for some of you, or you may not have performed as well as you'd hoped. That's completely okay ; the first test is often a learning experience. \n Remember, this exam is just one step in the learning process. It's not about where you are right now but how you can grow from here. \n Also, I understand that life can sometimes throw challenges our way — whether it's personal, family, or other commitments. These struggles can certainly impact how we perform academically, and it's important to recognize that. \n If you're unsure where things went wrong, I'd be happy to go over your exam with you. We can pinpoint areas to focus on for next time. \"","After each midterm I reach out to lower achieving students to identify potential barriers to learning and help them troubleshoot and make plans to improve their course outcomes.","An ice breaker on a fun activity or event that happened over the weekend \n Upcoming week \n I'll give you a couple of minutes to share with your team something fun you did or an interesting event you found over the weekend.","I told students to think silently about the question / problem before I prompt them to talk. \n October \n First, think silently about the question / prompt and then I'll cue you to discuss with your team.","Students work together the entire semester to design experiments and then analyze the data together.   They work together to create a Research Poster to present their findings to the class.","As we start analyzing messy data, I will discuss different approaches to analyze the same data, addressing any decisions that may impact data ethics. It is very important to recognize our own biases.","I will briefly share my interests in music in the well - being message sent on [Removed]. \n The week of Oct. 13th \n Our interests and hobbies can help us endure challenging times and value our uniqueness. \n","Over the course of the entire semester, students work in group of 3 - 4 to design and conduct experiments using a soil sample collected from one of [Removed]'s Field Stations.","There are many opportunities in the course : students complete lab assignments in groups that I assigned at the beginning of the semester, students work in groups to complete quick exercises during lecture, students can choose to work on a research project either independently or collaboratively.","I give students the questions about their work during lab several days before labs begin.   They go into lab knowing the data they need to collect and the questions they will need to answer with their data.   I do this each week.   Students should have plenty of time to reflect on their data before answering questions.","The TAs give their input to students about how they have done will in classes and what they have needed to do to change their grades.","I have several contingency policies in regard to students missing classes and homework discussed on the syllabus. I have also mentioned to students that I will work with them to schedule a make - up exam if they are sick on the day of a midterm exam.","[Removed] [Removed] carries an Ethics Flag, so I give students many opportunities over the course of the semester to discuss controversial issues.   Many times, that leads to students sharing their personal values.   Students have these discussions using [Removed], an social learning app.   Using this app, they read assigned articles, watch videos, and then answer prompts ( which I've written ) as well as comment on the issue.","Its important to draw a connection between topics and real world examples or applications. This is one of the criteria we are assessed on in yearly observations, but more so it helps students frame understanding and sort information.","I talk about the importance of hearing people say things in different ways, because some phrasings will resonate better sith some people than others.   I also talk about the importance of being engaged and participating for learning, even if an answer offered is incorrect.   Being incorrect is a part of learning.","The second [Removed] [Removed], and the final CIS.","Almost in every topic I find it extremely helpful to use a real life example","This course is based on attendance so we focus on the students attending class.","some of our ice breakers talk about current professionals in STEM","We continue to emphasize access to office hours and similar resources with considerable effort from the LAs to provide both office hours and study review sessions. Course extra credit is offered to encourage attendance and we will continue to emphasize these opportunities through the remainder of the course","I am using zombie problems, that way students will know what are the lowest performing questions and how the concept is helpful in being able to solve a similar question","I have several policies that allow students some flexibility for when life events happen.   They are allowed to miss one lab without any explanation needed.   I drop the lowest grade for several assignments.   This is clearly explained in the syllabus.","I combine working independently to mean that students can work with their neighbors. When I give an [Removed] problem, I ask students to read the question and then work with their neighbors on the problem. It is only after a few minutes of them working on the problem do I then start the conversation of how the problem may be solved with the whole class.","We did a personal values activity during the class that we talked about careers.   This activity had students look at a list of values and tell me about 2 - 3 that are most important to them.    Then discussed how knowing your values can help you decide what careers would be a good fit for them.","They just finished mdterm 1 - and there is not a whole loft of new info to discuss in discussion. \n Instead, students are gon na venture outside to observe flowers and pollinators. This is useful for a later assignment - but is also a moment to relax and enoy the benefits of nature. \n\n - this week \n - I will aonnounce it in classas a bit of a break to them / to relax and enjoy nature. \n","There is language in the syllabus and in my welcome announcements stating that I believe this. There are statements in the syllabus, and discussion in the class, about how in previous semesters essentially all students who have made use of the provided opportunities in the class / engage fully with the class have gotten the grades they hoped for regardless of starting points or setbacks to emphasize this point. There are many opportunities in the class for students to earn missed points back by doing additional / replacement assignments.","All assignments were based on identities of culture and race. This was done during all classes in a way that was broadcasted as positive and asset based.","I do this every day","I messaged individual students in all my courses who didn't do well on their weekly quizzes after unlocking the quizzes so they can make a second attempt ( which was available to all students but was not used by everyone ). I also did this to students who didn't submit their homework assignments on time and extended their due date. \n October and November \n I see that you did not do so well on the quiz. I extended your quiz until 12 pm today so please give it another try to make improvement. And feel free to reach out to me if there is anything I can do to help you thrive in this course. \n","I will use the essay from the first day to discuss how they feel about their progress after the first test.","using real life examples based on new materials","In the upcoming units, I plan to show more graphs and experimental data to help the students think about the content in a different way. For example, graphs could help exemplify the relationship between pressure and volume, or volume and temperature, within the Gas Laws unit, better than merely looking at a formula.","One of the examples that I showed students more recently during our discussion of moments of inertia is that how a single number can tell us some very important details about a planet. This was an attempt to bring in a real - world example of how we determine interior structures of planets by calculating their moments of inertia.","This is a good idea I need to think about how to do in basic physics but I will try","When lecturing, I like to plan specific questions at the start of certain topics that I pose to the class before we learn the specific formula / method for solving them.   I believe I allow them enough time to think of their own answers before moving on.","I use canvas instapoll questions. If students choose different answers, I usually invite 1 - 2 students to share their thoughts.","Send another well - being message through [Removed]. \n The week of the 13th. \n Last time I mentioned the university resources like x, y, and z that can help you cope with life challenges. I want to make sure you receive the support you need and reach out to me if you need additional support from me. We will discuss options and find accommodations that can relieve your situation. Feel free to reach out to me.","Peer instruction several times each class via [Removed] questions. \n\n I said \" if you can explain it to, or learn it from, a friend or neighbor, you will understand it better. \"","We use literature that focuses on experiences that they mostly may have lived. These experiences are based on real - world applications with relationship to education, an experience that they all have gone through as k-12 students and will continue to experience as college students.","During the first lecture, I shared my journey to [Removed]. I share stories about myself how to decide a research direction. I encourage students to visit me during the office hours. Except for right before a midterm, not many students have come to my office hours.","I would want to ensure students had enough background information. Then, I'd pose a more challenging type of problem or scenario they haven't seen explicitly yet in - class. They could discuss ways to solve the problem in small groups.","When conducting peer instruction, I allow several minutes ( or more ) for students to work together. I signal one minute left when about 75 - 80 % of students have answered. For impromptu questions, I estimate how long students need to discuss a specific question ( 20 - 90s ), allow for contributions, and usually pause for questions after a discussion.","I employ zombie problems on my exams. This semester midterms have 13 questions over new material plus 3 questions that are similar to low performing questions from the prior midterm. Students who go back to learn the process have the opportunity to improve their subsequent midterm score through demonstrating their learning over old material in addition to new.","I ensure students there are some built - in \" safety nets \" in the course. For example, they have three chances on each Learning Module, the lowest 33 % of in - class quizzes are dropped, and the use of Replacement Exams, instead of a a cumulative final exam, are used at the end of the semester. No one, single assignment needs to be a detriment to their final course grade.","We discuss the process of learning, have pre - class questions that attempt to highlight growth, use growth mindset language, etc.","For every prelecture topic, I ask students to provide a question or comment about it. I then use these to select examples or connections to bring up in class. I also provide my own comment or question about it, and do the same. I also occasionally have the TA or LAs contribute. I also occasionally post articles with connections in [Removed] but I don't know if anyone reads them.","We have instapoll queries in most class sessions and will continue to do so. We use this as an opportunity for students to discuss amongst themselves as well as with the LAs and myself.","In my large lectures we discuss the value of mistakes in helping to understand the decision process that goes into problem - solving. For my pedagogy courses we touch on specific mistakes and brainstorm changes to behaviors that would mitigate these.","I did an in class discussion about purpose where students discussed different kinds of purpose and tried to decide which ones applied to their work in this class. I very regularly give real - life or career related examples.","While at the beginning of each lecture I try to connect the physics concepts that we are going to learn to real - world applications, from time to time during the course I also mention to students that they should think about the skills that they are learning in the course and how they may be able to use those skills to solve complex problems in the world.","I'm teaching two pedagogy courses so reflection on personal learning goes hand - in - hand with the course content.","Pause my lecturing with practice problems students complete in small groups that they formed at the beginning of the semester.   I do this every class day, and the students expect it because these activities are labeled \" group practice \" or I have written on the slides \" complete the following in your group... \".","I am doing three hings : \n 1. reading quizzes on [Removed] ( ungraded ) \n 2. polling questions in class \n 3. at the start of every week, I aks them what was the muddiest point from the previous week. I summarize theses ( with help of AI ) and provide a handout to students.","I attended a roundtable discussion on Imposter Syndrome hosted by the [Removed] [Removed] Council and invited all students in my courses. After the event, I shared my insights with students in two courses. \n Oct 17th \n Invitation message : \" Today, the [Removed] [Removed] Council ( [Removed] ) is hosting an [Removed] Syndrome Roundtable from 4 - 5pm at [Removed] Patio. Professors in several departments throughout [Removed] will share their experiences in dealing with [Removed] Syndrome and facing self - doubt in their careers, providing an opportunity for open conversation between students and faculty over refreshments. I will be one of the speakers at the event, and I would love to see you there! If you are interested, please sign up. \"","Show how detecting and analyzing mutations are crucial for research and health \n Upcoming week ( learning about mutations ) \n By the end of class, I hope you recognize how detecting mutations is crucial to identifying potential carcinogens.","I had my students do the second writing activity on Personal Values. \n Nov 1 \n We all have important values and goals in life. I want to learn about your non - academic values - what you enjoy and care about. By recognizing your values and gifts, I hope you view your current challenges in the broader context of your life.","I am doing value based activities last week and then later in the semester.    We also have a whole class on mental health.","In labs and homework assignments, I use data from researchers of diverse backgrounds and give the students information about those scientists.   I also include a picture or video of those researchers in [Removed] or on the lab handout.","Students explored databases to analyze a gene and protein of their choice in their second project. Also, many topics covered in the third unit had real - world examples and applications for both courses I teach. \n October and November \n For this project, you'll choose a genetic condition of your interest and identify a protein - coding gene associated with the condition to do some research using the 3 websites provided in the project.","At the beginning of the semester, I make a [Removed] math review available to students. That set of modules is optional, but it's a place where students can do a bit of practice to refresh their memory of prerequisite math concepts that will be used in this course.","In - class quiz questions.","The students did a values based activity last week in class.    I am planning to do another values based activity later in the semester.","We made an effort to share that challenges will come up throughout the semester. We made sure to share positive thoughts at crucial times and share reaffirming messaging.","We will be discussing how they prepared for test 1 as we move to test 2","I will run a midsemester survey and I also occasionally do squarecap questions about aspects of the course.","I asked clicker questions and reflection questions that help students develop abilities and skills that can be applied beyond the course. \n Month of October \n Reflection question on exam : We have learned about several important experiments in the second unit. Choose one of the following experiments, describe the purpose and method of that experiment to a family member as your audience. Be clear and concise to help their understanding.","Post an assignment on making concept maps and flow - charts to learn about biochemical pathways today to have them complete next week before exam 3.","I already incorporate many real - world examples into my materials with real datasets but I am teaching a new course that did not include much background information about the datasets. I will make sure to emphasize the context for students by adding descriptions and pictures for the datasets I will use in the upcoming lessons.","Continue to tell stories about failure and improvement. \n [Removed] student's video how they mastered the physics course. \n LAs in class providing feedback. \n With email after the exam motivating students to make use of the re - take exam","About once a week, I remind students to come to office hours and try to convey what they can expect when they come.","During the first lecture, I emphasize the course content is highly relevant to those pursuing a STEM career. I stated that it won't be easy to master this content the first time around. I said \" Once you master this content, you can pursue a career in... \" \" I ask them : why choosing a challenging major? \"","I always emphasize that making mistakes with the R code is actually a better way to learn the syntax and how specific we need to be. I regularly use common mistakes with the R code to also emphasize concepts ( for example, how we need to choose how to represent data depending on its type ).","I have made examples in lecture more explicit and centered around answering a research question using real data.","That's what my whole course is about. They will create their own analysis and also review some analyses as case studies.","This was done already when presenting the theory of evolution by natural selection and talking about [Removed]'s experiences as a child, college student and husband.","The TAs will walk them through the exam this week in discussion.","I have statements in my syllabus about reaching out to me and/or the TA if they are unable to meet a deadline or miss a quiz.   I am typically very flexible, regardless of the reason, in granting extensions or make - ups.","We take students to the library so that they know how to use the [Removed] database for research. We connect them with [Removed] guidance as well as encourage them to attend writing support centers on campus.","I am planning to invite students to my music shows ( free to attend and near campus )! I know that a lot of them are playing an instrument or enjoy live music so it would be a great way for them to learn about my music. I also share posts from [Removed] for hiking ideas or win free tickets to a show.","I'm actually not sure on how to do this in my course. I provide worksheets to complete with code during lectures and I also release a key at the end of a week. I just wish I had good advice for the students to keep track of all of the R functions we learn in this course. I'm attending a webinar in October that should help on how to improve note taking for data science students in particular.","LA supported peer instruction using [Removed] to capture answers.","Some of our ice breakers talk about professionals in STEM.    Then give the students a chance to talk with each other about their STEM identity.","For this course students have been given tokens to request a 24 hour extension, also two lowest homework assignments will be dropped","Give a few minutes to think about a new problem before solving it with everyone \n Upcoming week \n I encourage you to think about this silently first before checking with your team. Then we'll solve it together.","Over the course of the semester, students conduct research about the soil microbiome using a soil sample they collected at one of [Removed]'s field stations.   Students examine the soil bacteria they isolate from their soil sample to look for evidence of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic production.   Students calculate the percentage of isolates that are resistant to two different antibiotics and the percentage of isolates that produce antibiotics.   Students conduct other biochemical assays as well to learn more about their soil isolates. At the end of the semester, students present their results to the class using a Research Poster.   I give them instructions for making these calculations and for presenting their in a poster.","By using instapoll during lectures students are able to practice the newly learned materials","In my courses there is a major collaborative project that is pursued through scaffolding assignments.
