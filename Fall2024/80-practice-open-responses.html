The professor also makes you do an instapoll every class, even at the end of class.","This class is very content heavy, but the workload isn't too bad because of the way Dr. [Removed] structures the homeworks. Learning the material is easy to do as long as you pay attention in class.","I would tell them it is largely dependent on their own learning outside of the class and to not rely on lectures to learn the material.","It is a challenging course but if you attend lecture and review the material you will be fine.","Very technical given the subject matter.","It is a lot of work, but it is manageable. Look over content before class \n","It involves studying everyday if you want to do well. Not only do you have to show up for class, but you need a lot of outside resources to succeed.","This course in not conceptually hard at all, and is honestly a lot of review from high school chemistry if you took that.   Also, there are so many opportunities to help you succeed like retests, drops, and bonus points.","It's helpful for discovering resources on campus and opening up new opportunities you may have never been aware of without it. It has also helped me not worry so much about certain things in my academic career.","An introduction to the most fundamental concepts of chemistry, helping to explain the structure of the smallest unit of matter ( atoms ), bonding, and the interactions between matter.","Fast paced biology that builds off of concepts from AP biology with an emphasis on genetic biology.","This is a very challenging course that goes in depth of the basic principles of chemistry. With proper studying, going to class and taking notes ; this class should not be too bad","A course that promotes critical thinking skills and includes instructors who will guide your thoughts","[Removed] 301 with Dr. [Removed] is a great intro chemistry course. Dr. [Removed] has a variety of resources to solidfy topics and lecture in class. It is a organized and structured class so expectations are clear early on. Dr. [Removed] is understanding with her grading policy and teaches well.","Hard but informative","This course is meant for STEM students with heavy emphasis on theory.","The class has a very good support system that makes it easy.","Difficult and time consuming, hard if you are taking it with a heavy course load.","An introduction into the basic principles of chemistry \n","It is not normal biology. It requires a lot of problem solving and a good understanding of statistics and probability. You just have to practice A [Removed].","This class is a good way to put you in track on in the loop of your degree plan and things around campus that could help you.","This course discusses the interactions between organisms and their environments, while also accounting for the changes caused by human influence.","This is a very hands - on lab that will give you practical experience working with bacteria.","This class is hard but the content can be fun","I would explain that the course is challenging, and it is something you definitely will have to put in effort to understand. However, there are plenty of materials and a great teaching team to set you up for success.","It is an explanation of how genetics function and impact daily lives.","I think this course starts off really pretty easily and slow and really picks up midway. It can be really difficult if you are not keeping up with it.","it definitely is a demanding course and requires your time and attention like most \" major \" science courses do. if you put in the work it will likely pay off and the professor is very understanding","it it very slow paced and easy to understand \n","Intermediate statistics course that covers the basics of data analysis and use of R studio.","This course a general overview of ecological concepts and models, and we focus on those general concepts to explain more specific examples.","I would describe it as well guided and informative. The course load is reasonable and easy to grasp.","I would highly recommend this course as it provides a plethora of knowledge not only about genetics but also how to apply this learning to many different applications in the real world.","It is very low stress, but the lecture can be hard to stay focused in.","I would describe it as a course for those who want to learn about [Removed] in a very conceptual based way. There is some math, but it is more about understanding and applying concepts.","Dr. [Removed] is very good at teaching the basics, especially when you acknowledge the fact that I haven't taken a chemistry course since honors chemistry in 10th grade. The learning modules help make up any gaps, and the quizzes and tests are all things we're pretty well prepared for.","This course deals with topics about electricity, magnitude, and optics.","The topics covered in this course are similar to AP chemistry, but it goes into more detail on each topic and is much more fast - paced.","A helpful introduction to data science field","It is an outline of the basic fundamentals of biological inheritance. There is a lot of statistics and probability.","It's pretty cool, and the workload isn't too bad. It definitely requires a bit of thinking, but it's pretty fun.","The course is very fun and rewarding. The information we learn about antibiotics using that knowledge to apply to our experiments is very rewarding.","Genetics is the study of [Removed]. In this class we deal with not only the study of genetics, but we also look at the technological innovations and ethical concerns that accompany it.","This course is an interesting one but at the same time it is difficult. you will wanna cry from time to time and you may even fail a quiz or two but its okay because its part of the learning experience.","It's a fun class to learn more about the environment and life.","Basic overview course of learning how to analyze data with [Removed]","This course focuses on understanding the data analysis process in R, including cleaning and tidying data, creating data visualizations, and producing models and regressions to make predictions.","With prior knowledge it is an easy course, otherwise being in class and reviewing the topics should be fine","[Removed] based a lot in quizzes and midterms. Learning modules and practice problems are the best to prepare for test and understand the material. \n","A good introduction into data science for those with no programming experience but knowledge in basic statistical principles.","Introduction to [Removed] is a broad class that goes over the general field of statistics and its tools of analysis.","It is essentially AP [Removed] from high school, with one or two extra topics. The class has a good amount of workload and gives you the necessary resources to succeed.","This course has been super helpful in gaining the necessary knowledge to succeed in this course and prepare me for those that follow.","The course is very material heavy, but the material is interesting.","This is an introduction to genetics course where we delve more into what we learned in [Removed] about genetics","It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be, but I'm glad I took it.","It is a relatively fast paced course that requires you to spend time outside of class learning and reviewing the material.","It is pretty fun and not super hard \n","Its good","Chemistry 301 is a fast - paced lecture class where they are multiple tests and quizzes.","This class is interesting and not too difficult at the moment.","It is a fundamental course that teaches the basics. You should make sure to do the modules and learn from them.","Introductory course into general chemistry, pretty large class but still feel connected with having a personal study group.","A huge lecture hall with a presentation of content","I would describe this course as a good solid foundation and understanding of [Removed] but the coursework can be rigorously challenging.","Understanding complex nature of life","The course is extremely difficult and will definitely involve more than just going to lectures. To succeed, you will need to pursue [Removed], office hours, and maybe tutoring to keep an A. The questions on exams are quest - generated so sometimes it feels much more challenging and like we're seeing new content.","Basic chemistry as you'd expect. It has some overlap with highschool chemistry and I felt well - eased into the content in the beginning. The prep modules scared me, but honestly weren't even necessary for the first exam.","Its pretty easy but you have to self study most of the time. The concepts are easy to understand so no stress.","[Removed] [Removed] with Dr. [Removed] is a more interactive biology course with heavy focus on understanding. Dr. [Removed] cares about and wants her students to succeed to the assignments are all centered on recall and a deeper understanding of the content taught in lecture.","Physics is a hard course but Dr. [Removed] make hard concepts easy to understand in class. Homeworks reflect material that is covered in class but I do wish we had more conceptual question practice and question that use multiple equations to solve it","It is not an extremely hard course. However to do well, one must study lots outside of class but you are provided lots of study material that is super helpful.","This class is definitely manageable, but paired with courses such as [Removed], the class is more difficult.","Intro to [Removed] is a more detailed review of high school biology with a similar learning format of slides and lecture. Homework requires much explanation, so an understanding of the concept is something you must have.","This course teaches you the fundamentals of ecology.","Good instructor, mostly review from AP [Removed]. If you go to class, you shouldn't have any trouble at all getting at least a B - plus.","A course that is grounded in reasoning and logic with math on the side.","I would describe it as an easy course, but requires studying and work to make it easy. Not a lot of extra time outside of homework time to study.","I would describe this course as very straightforward in which the professor or the TA is willing to help you if you have any questions. I believe the discussion sections are also a very helpful aspect of the course.","If I was describing this course to a friend I would say that it is one that requires a lot of learning material outside of the classroom.

[Removed] 301 offers an excellent introduction into the subatomic world, helping students build a foundation for tackling even more complex concepts in chemistry.","It is a very good course for those needing credit for [Removed], quizzes and tests are relatively easy, and even if you don't do well, there are two replacement tests to replace the two lowest scoring test. However, there is a lot of content to cover in a short amount of time, so it would be best to learn the concepts beforehand.","This class is good to take to get into chemistry. Its very test heavy but the teacher and learning modules are very helpful.","This course is a research and bacterial based investigation of soil isolates. We collect what could be soil bacteria, sustain them, and run tests on them to identify bacterial character, antibiotic resistance, and antibiotic production.","I would describe this course as a study of the interactions between organisms in ecosystems.","This course is a fun hands on experience which help deepens the understanding of the world around us.","Dr. [Removed] makes the content pretty comprehensive. Class is also interactive.","This course is really easy and prepares you for college and gets you interested in chemistry","It is a fairly straightforward course, as long as you make sure to attend lectures and follow along with the notes. The quizzes help prepare students along the way, and the learning modules help understand the lecture materials.","This is a course about general chemistry. It is a more in depth look on the basics of what you learned in high school chemistry.","It is difficult content but the way the class is structured makes it manageable.","You learn a lot in this course and you need to study a lot for the exams but class is enjoyable.","This course is an interesting course if you are interested in [Removed]. For me personally, I enjoy Dr. [Removed] lectures and passion. It is a bit challenging but with the support given it is very manageable.","This course teaches you the basics of data science through [Removed]","This course provides a general overview of ecological processes, starting from organismal interactions to evolution and adaptations.","It demonstrates study habits as well as gets you familiar to the campus.","It is built for students to succeed.","This class is a lot of work but the content is kind of interesting.","Fast paced, especially the second unit. As long as you set aside time to start at least 1 week before exam to start prep, you will be fine!","This class outlines the basics of statistics in a way that is targeted towards STEM majors to prepare them on how they will have to manipulate data in the future with a side learning objective of learning the basics of R in [Removed].","The lab section is nice and interesting and pretty easy to follow along. It's also a lab were the work you do feels like it means something but there is a little bit of busy work out side of class.","This course is forgiving, offering students the opportunity to earn up to 30 bonus points and two retakes — one for each of the two midterms. With a basic high school chemistry background, the course material should be manageable.","It's a good course to take but can be really hard at times.","It's about the foundational principles of chemistry and gives a good overall idea of the subject. It can be a lot of work, so I'd recommend keeping up with the coursework and attending office hours.","Not that bad if you're willing to put the effort into it.","It's a hands - on experience that helps learn about biological procedures while learning about current events.","This course is an entry level Chemistry course. A lot of effort has to be made outside of class in order to be successful in the course.","Physics is a course that requires understanding how to apply formulas to certain situations.","You have to pay attention and study outside of class.","It is a lovely introduction to the principls of chemistry.","Really reallt tough grading, so don;t treat the class like a blow off, be maticulous","I would say that it is definitely challenging, but there are so many resources that you can take advantage of to be successful in it. For example there are numerous office hours all throughout the week, extra reading and worksheets, reviews of the entire unit, and more.","It is introduction to physics with math using algebraic concepts.","I think it is interesting. Requires logic.","This is an intro to biology course that covers the topics of cell and molecular biology."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>instructor_id<\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.course_description<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"instructor_id","targets":1},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":2},{"name":"or.course_description","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

course, the instructor is always taking the time to answer students' questions during class and office hours. This was especially shown when a lot of people struggled with complex modules and she was able to thoroughly answer the questions.","","","","We have recently talked to a [Removed] honors advisor and it was helpful to know they hold spots for tip scholars. It was a good opportunity to travel on a different path if we chose to apply to be a honors scholar and take those honors classes.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","There have been mentions of office hours as well as [Removed] learning center.","","","The syllabus clearly states that you can reach out to the professor or teaching assistants in an appropriate time frame and redo an assignment if needed.","","","","","","","","","","","I'm not sure","","","","","","I don't remember anything that took an exceptional amount of time.

I remember in the first week of school as well, the prof [Removed] had the TAs share their feedback and encourage students to talk to the TAs for advice on the course and how they had succeeded. He does talk about this a lot in regards to seeking advice from the TAs.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","In my bio lab course, the instructor regularly encouraged us to reflect on our learning strategies, particularly after exams or significant assignments. For example, after our first lab report, the instructor had us complete a short reflection on what study methods worked, what didn't, and how we could improve for future reports. The instructor said, \" Take a few moments to think about how you approached the assignment and whether there's a better way to manage your time or study more effectively. \" This reflection helped refine my approach and better manage my time in future labs.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Before each unit exam, Dr. [Removed] will release a practice exam to allow students to take to check their understanding and how prepared they are for the real exam.

[Removed] is a great professor! The Learning Modules are extremely helpful to complete before class, primarily because it's easier to understand as she goes more in - depth in the topic. I enjoy all of the resources she provides for her students in regards to exam preparation.","She is very open and approachable.","I like the structure of her class, and her learning modules are helpful. She offers a lot of good resources to help us succeed in the class.","Very good instructor especially considering I am going from high school physics to college level physics.","Dr. [Removed] does a good job at encouraging students to ask questions and to visit office hours so he can clear up any confusion in this very challenging course.","Not at this time.","I can tell how much effort has gone into setting up the curriculum for this class! And prof. [Removed] is so kind and patient :)","Our instructor and TA are always floating around the world to observe our work to make sure we're doing everything right, and if we have questions they'll walk over to help us and make sure we completely understand before going to float again. They never get mad at us for making mistakes and just want us to learn from us, and they have made me feel like there are no stupid questions.","He provides a lot of extra credit which I feel helps most of the students.","I can tell Professor [Removed] has spent many years perfecting the structure of his course that creates a perfect balance of learning motivation and effort while not being too overwhelming in such a content - heavy course.","Her classes are very good and have a good pace, in the sense that they are not to fast neither monotonous. I'd recommend her to anyone interested in the course.","i love the way the new chemistry classes have been formatted.","Not really just that she's a great instructor.","The teacher is very nice and appreciate that she gives us the resources to succeed.","Our instructor is incredibly knowledgable, genuine, and makes himself approachable and accessible to students.","For me, a lot of information is repeated to the point where I think it's redundant. However, many of my peers will ask questions that make it seem like they don't understand certain concepts. I might try and find more ways to explain each concept in the course in order to make teaching the material more efficient.","I greatly appreciate the amount that the professor offers extra credit opportunities to students.","The instructor seems kind and understanding of students and encouraging of student success in her course.","No, there isn't anything else I would like to share.","No! Dr. [Removed] is great though. Very lucky to have her as my physics professor. Other professors should look up to her in terms of teaching methods and encouraging students.","I think [Removed] is very knowledgable in his field. What he does that is very nice is he shared research opportunities, which is very important for people like me in pre - med that are looking for research opportunities.","I think he's a great professor. He enjoys the content.","I think she should ignore student distractions and continue to give the lecture instead of pointing it out ( or threatening us that she will not provide the same information to us as she did in her other classes )   because it takes away from time that could be spent giving the lecture.","I think she could be a little bit more encouraging during class and give out more words of encouragement.","I really enjoy the class format of asking students to also answer questions during class -- in general I find that engaging classes are the ones that I enjoy ( and do the most well in ).","I can not think of anything, but the enthusiasm of the instructor is a bit lackluster, and she seems very montone and not excited to teach.","My TA is extremely understanding of all issues and composes herself in a way that is commendable. I have nothing but positive thoughts about her and she does an amazing job.","This instructor wants to see her students succeed, and makes sure they have every resource necessary, from question types and study materials to complete reviews and prerequisite information. Anything that a student needs is accessible to them, and there are several TAs ready to answer questions. The overall environment to this course, even with over 1300 people enrolled, is comfortable and success oriented.","I like how she quizzes us over material she lectures over that day as it reduces the stress I feel the night before and forced me to concentrate during class.","I love discussion acitivities! It helps me a lot to practically apply class materials and biological concepts.","She always posts learning modules on canvas so we can do them before class and get a better understanding of the material before lecture.","They gave us lots of practice that was similar to the test and that helped me prepare.","As a future educator myself, it was very impressive that the day after the exam she changed how she taught us in class. You could tell she wasn't super happy with our test scores and resorted to giving us more hands on work to hopefully enhance our learned. Do I think I will end up with an A in this class? Probably not, but I have already learned so much and appreciate Professor [Removed]' efforts to keep us on track as a class!","He moves fast but provides good material.","I hope the instructor could upload the worksheet key after she's done with talking about all these. I think it would be better for me to review the materials before something new comes.","Instructor is very encouraging and likes to make sure we are engaged during the lectures","Nope, thank - you.","Dr. [Removed] has had us work together on a few worksheets during class, which I have found helpful. I like also having activities in class that help me actually use / answer questions with the material that I've learned -- I find that it really helps my learning.","He is great, honestly. Very respectful and knowledgeable","I am really enjoying this class, and hope to see what the future leads to!","Dr. [Removed] is a great instructor and pushes us to be the best we can be. I appreciate her teaching style and I am excited for the rest of the course. \n","I really liked that at the very beginning of the first couple classes, Dr. [Removed] asked us fun questions as ice breakers to talk about with our neighbor, which made it less awkward to talk to them about the material when prompted later in class.","The instructor was always receptive to questions and always assured us that if we ever had any concerns, we should communicate them.","It is not really a class that deserves feedback. It is set up to set us students up for success and to share resources the university provides.","She is very kind and calming, and I can tell she truly cares about her students.","The professor takes the time to reach out to students individually if they voice any concerns. They truly care about the class, and I would take this class again as of right now.","I like that he encourages us to work with people near us when answering questions during lecture/","I think that the study guide materials are extremely helpful and beneficial.","I would like to say that I've thoroughly enjoyed this class thus far, and look forward to learning about the new content in the upcoming weeks. I would also like to say the class has been very engaging and has provided so many resources to help me ensure that I understand the material.","I do really like Dr. [Removed], I wish we had a smaller class so I would be able to get to know her personally.","N / [Removed] Dr. [Removed] has been great so far!","I do sometimes feel a bit lost in the class by the way the professor teaches. I feel that the topics are not very clear and there's not a good explanation as to why something works the way it does. Chemistry right now is my hardest class because it is difficult to understand the unit. The questions the professor asks are overall confusing and do not much information as to how to approach the question. I would enjoy more explanation on certain topics.","I love the fact that we get groups for class to discuss assignments. They're very helpful when answering questions.","Overall, while the learning modules are helpful, I do wish most of the material was taught in lectures.","Dr. [Removed] often gets frustrated in class when TA's answer student questions. However, the questions students ask are very important and most people rely on TA's to answer these questions because Dr. [Removed] won't. She also stops class often and gets distracted by students whispering. The constant stopping in class usually leads to us not having enough time to finish quizzes or slide presentations.","Not that I can think of. She seems like a good instructor and I appreciate her!","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor and lecturer","Dr. [Removed] is a very funny man and I enjoy learning from him.","The instructor made it clear at the beginning of the course that if any accommodations were needed to alert her through the routes given by the university, and to talk to her if further discussion over the accommodations was necessary.","I wish Dr. [Removed] would take handwritten notes with us over the concepts instead of just going over slideshows during class. He is an amazing professor, but I want a more interactive way to understand the material.","She's a great instructor and her class is really enjoyable.","Everything is good!","I think the instructor does a good job of staying on track and covering the course material well. I think she can improve on her way of teaching the course. She could add more activities and experiences to demonstrate in class.","Dr. [Removed] is a very laid back professor in a way where he provides a calm learning environment during class. That allows to not feel stressed out during class and comfortable when I do not understand something the first time it is taught to me. His TAs are always engaged during class and he always encourages group collaboration and full class participation when learning new topics.","I enjoy that Dr. [Removed] cares about the people we are outside of the physics classroom. I've heard from other students how even though they don't particularly enjoy physics, they enjoy having Dr. [Removed] as a professor. I enjoy physics as a course and also enjoy Dr. [Removed] as a professor because of his focus on who we are, what goals we have, and what we value in our personal lives. He understands that physics is not exactly what gets us all out of bed in the morning and can connect with us on other levels.","Something I admire a lot in teachers is someone that encourages improvement and learning. In this course so far we are allowed 2 attempts on quizzes which is great since it allows for improvement instead of punishing not succeeding the first time around. I also like that homework is graded on effort, it pushes me to produce the best quality submission I can while not punishing a student if they are wrong. When a course is too strict with grading I find the students within it feel very negative about the material and may even resort to cheating, but when effort is considered more I see people keep trying and be genuinely engaged in the material.","She is very nice and approachable, but the lectures are sometimes rushed and vague.","i like that he is very nice and understanding","I think she is a great professor! She tries really hard to make sure everyone is comfortable with the material and tries to make the content fun and engaging. I never really thought I could understand physics, but she has given me the courage to try my best, and that caused me to get my first 100 on a physics exam. :)","I find that having to complete learning modules as homework is extremely helpful in the course because it is nice to be introduced to new concepts individually ( at your own pace ) and then get to listen to [Removed]'s lectures about that specific topic the next day and really understand it better than before.","I do like professor [Removed]'s teaching style. It is more traditional in the way that you just come to class and take notes of what he writes on a blank piece of paper. He is very approachable which is great too. I do wish there were more resources on canvas available except for homework and a set of practice problems. As much as I practiced these I still did poorly on the exam and wish I could [Removed] had something else to study.","Overall, [Removed] Hall is a good instructor. Some of this didn't really apply because this course is a lab course, and doesn't have lecture times for it either. So the only content that is important in this course is what we deduce at the end of each lab after experiments. The instructor is very helpful during class, and seems to enjoy being a lab instructor.","Great class! Professor [Removed] helps make it easy to understand and wants his students to learn and succeed.","I really like how our professor teaches, it is very clear and I learn a lot from her. I also really appreciate the study guides she has available for us.","I like the instructors approach to portraying material, especially with providing examples as a lot of professors in the department don't do that which leaves students lost on homework a lot of the time.","The professor made the class feel kind of stale at times, like it was just information on information without taking a second to tell a joke or ease the tension in the room. It felt like an hour and 15 minutes of information","I feel that the instructor could be more efficient in spending class time. We are always behind and this causes me to get confused often because the instructor starts to speed through all the other slides. We go through the material a little too fast and do not go in - depth on certain topics. This causes me to have to go through the lecture material after class and try to relearn it all.","Dr. [Removed] is very friendly and professional. He once offered a cough drop to a student who was coughing loudly, and he makes little jokes every now and then. It really improves the climate of the class","Dr. [Removed] is a funny and engaging lecturer, but the material we cover and quest practice is not sufficient to succeed at the level I am used to, even though I prepared thoroughly with the lecture notes and homework problems.","She gets into the lesson really fast, and I feel like I have to pay attention very well in class, or I will miss vital information.","No, she's pretty good at her job.","The professor is very quick to respond to student concerns and if the issue involves a large portion of the class she will take a few minutes at the beginning of class to mention the issue and resolve it if she has already found the solution. If she does not have an immediate solution, she keeps students updated until she has one.","The instructor hasn't done anything negative, the class has been nothing but relaxing.","I think it will be great for the Lab and HW keys to be released after grading is finished to see our mistakes and what we could improve on as students.","I think Professor [Removed] does an excellent job with [Removed] [Removed] His lectures are generally interesting and are well connected to previous content covered. He seems to understand that not everyone will immediately grasp a concept ; during in class [Removed] quizzes, he drops hints to guide our thinking. With the example of [Removed] quizzes, my previous physics instructor ( [Removed] 303 K ) did not provide any guidance, and the quizzes were more heavily weighted on being correct, which ultimately led to confusion, the feeling that I wasn't learning, and even resenting some of the course content. \n\n Otherwise, Professor [Removed] is very approachable. I've asked a few questions myself and have been satisfied with his responses, and I've not seen him answer a question in a way that belittles or embarrasses a student. I feel that Professor [Removed] and the students both understand that [Removed] [Removed] can be rather difficult.","He always has a positive attitude which makes going to class enjoyable.","No, she skips over some material and doesn't time manage lecture well sometimes and focuses on easier concepts then leaves us to figure out the harder concepts on our own.","Not at the moment. \n","All assignments should be posted to [Removed] in advance. It is frustrating when the pre - labs are hidden on [Removed], and all the posted assignments don't even have the included link to complete the assignment ( ethics board ).","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor who wants all of her students to succeed.","Dr. [Removed] is a special physics professor in that he doesn't teach over your head. Oftentimes it's been my and my peers' experience that physics teachers &amp; professors teach their classes as if they assume the class has already seen some or all of the material, and thus they blaze through the topics without stopping to think about how their students are responding or learning -- in other words, they teach right over their students' heads. I really appreciate that Dr. [Removed] understands who he's teaching and what background knowledge they do and don't already have, and adjusts his teaching style and pace accordingly. It makes the class much less stressful and more enjoyable.","On the first week of school he created an assignment where we had to leave a notecard by his office after class. This helped us know where his office was and when his office hours were, which I thought was really helpful.","Dr. [Removed] is a very engaging lecturer. His experiments during class to illustrate the content we are learning really creates a memorable experience. I also really enjoy his witty, dry sense of humor that makes his class entertaining. I have not once struggled to pay attention in his class.","  I am grateful that she gave me a chance to improve on a mistake, however the quizzes seem a bit stressful and unnecessary to the goals of this class.","No there is not.","Professor [Removed] is a really good teacher and overall I really enjoy his teaching style","i love how an 88 is an A-. that makes me excited to actually put in the effort and try for this class because an 88 is more doable than 90","The professor reviews important topics, and puts links to slides and information in the canvas for those who want extra studying but don't have time during the day for tutoring or office hours.","She tends to skip through material since she doesn't explain it fast enough.","She encourages us to come to office hours and to rely on our peers, TA's and other resources when we are stuck on a problem, teaching us that even the brightest mind will need help eventually.","I feel like Dr. [Removed] is a very understanding teacher and gives all of her students many options to pick from in order to earn credit in her class. She also has a 24 hr grade period for late assignments which is very helpful when most of her students are taking other rigorous courses. I believe that she is a great teacher and cares very much for her students and their time and personal lives.","I love her energy and how passionate she is","actually break down the math problems and explain step by step where each thing is coming from because this'll help students who do not have prior experience","No she is great and teaches the content well","My professor releases practice exam questions that help ALOT during exam season!! His homework accurately reflects his exams, so it's easy to prepare for the exams.","The instructor is good at teaching physics and the homeworks are both challenging and fair. However the midterms do not align with the homeworks or practice midterms or in class content in terms of caliber of difficulty. I would recommend either lowering the difficulty of the midterms to match the practice we do or raise the difficulty of the homeworks to match the midterms while giving us more flexibility with the homework to better process the information","I like the vibes of this class and encourage y' all to keep it up. It certainly creates a positive experience -- especially since this is my first lab. Thank y' all :)","I feel comfortable going to this professor if I am struggling and need help.","I feel that Dr. [Removed] is very concerned with student needs and attempts to provide all students the chance to reach mastery. However, in a 300 person lecture class, it can be difficult to meet students at a diverse set of backgrounds and hear all their difficulties. While I do feel that the teaching assistants alleviate this burden, I still feel that, for those struggling, the overall size and organization of the class can make the experience frustrating.","I don't really like chemistry, but I am not doing as bad in this class as I thought I would. I feel like chem courses are usually really hard to pass, but I've understood about 75 % of the material without crazy studying.","The instructor created a very welcoming environment. He made it very clear that he was available to ask for help. He had a good amount of office hours and catered well to the students who needed assistance.","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind and supportive teacher! She is dutiful about uploading any content a student might need, and is readily available for extra help!","I love Dr. [Removed] passion, however the content and rigor of this course is inevitable and does not compare. I feel a little more understanding when it came to grading exams and homework's would be nice. The material is hard and as a student I can guarantee we are doing the best we possibly can even when our grades don't reflect that.","Dr. [Removed] does an amazing job for a large lecture learning environment to keep me engaged and to follow along. She provides a variety of resources for students to study. Overall, I think the class is well structured, and the materials provided are good. The only problem I have sometimes had, is her slides she has on the board are not consistent with the slides she posts online for me to follow along. I also did not like when content on quizzes at the end of class is connected to content barely addressed right before the quiz ( I don't learn that fast ). Overall again she provides lots of opportunities and resources to do good. I really like the practice tests, and question type system she posts.","He would often talk students through common misconceptions in interpreting how physics works and this has been exceptionally important to me. I'm not someone who understands physics well and having someone talk to me explaining why I have misconceptions about a concept and why the correct method is correct has been extremely useful.","She s a good professor, she s nice.","Thank you for being so open to improvement and really care about your students! I really appreciate it and that's the kind of teacher I want to be.","I don't like taking quizzes in such a cramped space with so many people, because it makes me pressured. I do like the question types and the study guide, which provides exactly the information you need to know. I also like how the professor took out certain unclear questions because it showed that she really cared about fairness.","better study guides for the exams","Dr. [Removed] is the nicest person ever","She is an awesome professor and very vulnerable which is so important to see as a college student","She's a good professor who helped me understand the course material.","She doesn't let people talk about what is happening in the class even if they are whispering. She derails the class to talk about how my class is the worst whispering class.","She is a great professor.","Her encouragement is helpful","Very nice and helpful during class","I'd like to be more aware of what specifically students make mistakes with and how I can improve not making them.","dr [Removed] hasn't done much","He made sure there were lots of options we could take to study the material.","Not so much about the instructor, because it has been a good experience so far, but one thing I'd keep in mind is about how much space each student has on the desk during quizzes / exams. There isn't much space to work with so sometimes that's an issue. Another thing I would recommend is if a student misses out on a lecture due to a legitimate reason there should be a way he / she can make it up.","Dr. [Removed] consistently brings a ton of passion and energy to class that makes me feel excited to be there and learn the course content. I'm a chem major so it'd be easy for me to just try and get through this class as painlessly as possible without really taking anything in but Dr. [Removed]'s passion for physics prevents me from falling into that trap. This especially come out when she's doing demos. She always seems super excited to show us the science in action, and you can really feel that energy rub off on the class. People laugh a lot more in that class than in any of my others and genuinely seem like they're having fun.","I really like Dr. [Removed]. She's by far the most approachable professor I've had. I struggle in coding, but she makes it feel like everyone is capable. She's open to different ideas and problem - solving skills. Dr. [Removed] is truly one of the best professors on campus.","I think she's great but she moves too fast","The instructor is wonderful and provide guidance depending on the situation and the student. However, the student assistant of the professor don't have similar approach to teaching others.","I find Dr. [Removed] personable and encouraging. I leave the class with a better understanding of the material thanks to her clarity and the class structure. I benefit from the flow of learning modules, in - class lectures, and instapolls / quizzes.","I love Professor [Removed]'s class because I don't feel stressed about my grade, and I can instead focus on learning the material and applying it.","I think the amount of work in this course is unnecessary. It could be reduced without changing the overall learning experience. It is a 2 hour course with 4 hours of lab a week and at least 2 hours worth of additional assignments per week.","Our instructor is very calming and clear in presenting course material. She breaks facets of the class down in a clear way and leaves room for not only lecture but also problem solving in the classroom.","The instructor is very friendly, positive, personable, and understanding. Her courses focus on being able to apply data science and work through inevitable roadblocks. I enjoyed a past course so much that I chose to take her class for data science as well.","The instructor creates a very good learning environment, but I wish that he would assist more on preparing us for the test.","She is the nicest and most understanding professor!","The instructor is awesome","It was such a hard course to study because the lecture did not explain the basics at all ( basic concepts, terminology, etc. ) and had all of them for the students to study by themselves through learning modules. The modules were hard to read, text - heavy were always uploaded late and required much more time commitment than the lecture. \n Also the professor didn't cover the whole materials before the exam in the lecture","Often times there is little room or time for questions as the instructor often brushes past all the subjects fast. this leaves students confused and their questions unanswered.","Dr. [Removed] is a wonderful instructor and she has made the [Removed] Science class really fun and engaging!!","N / A, [Removed] she's doing a great job.","Nothing else except I wish the quizzes were easier. Having multiple prelabs with [Removed] of possible questions seems like busy work.","I am not a super fast learner, so I am not very comfortable with the in class quiz because the material is too new","Just an overload of course work that seems unneccesary at times. For example for quizzes we had to learn 80 questions just for 2 to be asked, it just seemed like so much to learn in so little time. It was very stressing.","I liked how she gives examples on each thing as we are going through lecture.","Professor [Removed] is a great lecturer, plus his labs are well - organized. The lab classes would be better if he is able to make time to help students in the lab sections ( whether it's in - person or virtually ).","He's good at incorporating examples into his lectures that we've seen in real life.","I wish that she would give go more into detail on the newer information to college freshman and not spend so much time on the already known things, such as electronic configurations and such. Also feel like the class could be much shorter if she got through content faster and didn't let distractions slow her down.","My instructor often speaks on her own experiences and shortcomings which makes her very relatable and more approachable. I really appreciate when she takes time to do this because none of my instructors have been vulnerable enough to share how they felt as students and even young professionals in their field.","I appreciate how there are several resources available to study and review before exams. I also appreciate the office hours and academic communities hosted throughout the week.","There is nothing else I would like to add.","I like Dr. [Removed] as a professor and think he genuinly tries to make the class interesting and relatable.","He gives half point back to missed questions on midterms, which encourages us to learn our mistakes topics again ; I like it","I really like Professor [Removed]'s positive attitude. She really seems to connect with us. I also like how much in - class practice she has us do, it's helpful.","It's sometimes hard to follow along with the lectures since my professor often underlines words but it's hard to connect them together.","I think Professor [Removed] is an excellent professor. She is very approachable and kind and explains things very well.","I would like to say that Dr. [Removed] is a great professor. She makes sure her students are engaged in class and does her best to make her students have the opportunities to be successful.","I appreciate how the instructor reminds us about other resources we can use to help our understanding of the material.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor, but we can easily get lost with how fast paced the lectures. Although she does go more in - depth during office hours.","I wish there was more guidance on how to learn so much information. As an introductory biology course it would be easier on our grades of homework wasn't just one submission","[Removed] she lit.","She is very caring and knowledgeable. She cares about students and wants them to succeed in her class. She's happy to answer the questions that we may still have after class, and she emphasizes the growth mindset and discussion with peers to talk about the problems before going over in class together.","I really appreciate Dr. [Removed]'s apparent care for his students and his passion for teaching others. He shares valuable life experiences and examples that help us connect concepts to the real world. It is clear that he loves his job and wants others to enjoy learning and gain something from his course.","The professor is very straightforward in lectures and explains topics to a good amount, though she can be a little too fast - paced for the students taking notes. She is very nice and open to answering questions and I really like her attitude in class.","Dr. [Removed] has made me love chemistry. I always had a hard time with anything science related, but the way she teaches makes me understand the material.","Sometimes the content is covered too quickly but the resources make it easier to cover outside of class.","I love her formatting style of teaching as it really lets me grasp my understanding of the material!","She is a very genuine, understanding, and approachable professor. Extremely nice!","My professor does the best job at going through material with the time she has, so it is understandable if we go a bit quicker than other subjects. There is also a significantly high student to TA ratio, so there s oftentimes a lot of questions that go unanswered.","I think she is a great professor, however, I think that she can accept questions more often because I feel like she doesn't because she doesn't have a lot of time to.","I find the instructor's style of lecture to be hard to follow and, at times, unhelpful. The flipped classroom model helps to give and understanding of the class materials going into the class, but further self - instruction is beneficial.","[Removed] is definitely the best of the best! I really enjoy the seminars! They are super informative! Those life skills are definitely going to be valuable! It'll come in handy!","The [Removed] course is sometimes hard to navigate and the learning modules are only posted days before they are due rather than in the beginning of the semester or in a calendar","She is helpful when answering questions and breaking down problems to provide easier understanding.","Dr. [Removed]'s teaching structure is very clear and helpful to my success. Knowing that I am not set up for failure and have so many resources is a great comfort","Dr. [Removed] is amazing. She is one if not the most caring professors I have had at [Removed]","She's always been very supportive throughout the course and has provided even some practice from another professor who has also taught this course Mrs. [Removed], overall she's been great support and provided me with a push to continue working hard on all of my classes.","She had fun experiments during class that made the class more enjoyable.","I appreciate all her emails and positive attitude when it comes to learning.","He is very approachable and when I went to drop off my notecard with my name and major he stood up from his desk to greet me and answer my questions which made me feel much more comfortable in the course","I think she reads off the slides during her lectures but does a good job with examples.","She is very thoughtful","I really enjoyed the positive energy and support the instructor brought to class.","Sawyer is a great person who is very relatable and easy to talk to. She really cares about us and our projects, and she is willing to help no matter how long it takes. She is very knowledgeable in the course and has no issue helping us out at any point.","Dr. [Removed] is a wonderful professor, and I really feel supported in the course.","nothing comes to mind at the moment.","The professor has been fair and accommodating.","I love how caring Dr. [Removed] is about her students and prioritizes our wellbeing. She often sends out messages reminding us to take a breath and get enough sleep and make sure that we are taking care of ourselves.","There is nothing much else to share! I just need to study a lot.","Dr. [Removed]'s positivity and openness makes her class very interesting and exciting, despite the difficulty of the material.","He is truly incredible and structures the course incredibly well!","I think that the course so far provides all the materials I need to be successful in it. I think it could be improved with smaller handouts that are more specific to only the concepts and with maybe one or two exercises. I like looking at the handouts after class, and I think this would make it easier to follow.","Review on the day of exam was really helpful.","I believe that my lab instructor, [Removed] creates a really comfortable environment where everyone is not intimidated to ask questions or answer questions. I appreciate their efforts to help us with our experiments and make sure everything goes smoothly. I also really appreciate them created a shared playlist everyone can add to, to play in the background of the lab","He is a very good professor, but I feel like sometimes he goes a little to fast. I know there is a lot of concepts to cover, but sometimes he goes through the topics too quick and doesn't give time to process what he has written.","This class I have felt successful in because Dr. [Removed] presents students with many opportunities to succeed. She posts detailed learning modules for knowledge prior to the lectures and posts several resources for studying for exams.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor. I find that I have understanding of new material just as rich as understanding I have of material I was refreshed upon.","She is a very approachable and understanding instructor. She is very open to answering questions and always checks in to make sure we are understanding what she is teaching. I really like how the course is structured! It's straightforward and informative!","Thank you for your patience with questions in class! Nothing is more frustrating as a student than asking a question in class to receive a condescending or half baked answer from a professor. Keep up the good work!","When I was struggling with a family emergency and had to go home, Dr. [Removed] was very patient and gave me time to be with my family and complete my assignments with no penalties.","Dr. [Removed] makes class really fun. Love her demos","No there is no extra information","I love the practice tests and condensed topics list that all [Removed] students have access to. It allows me to study with my roommate who has [Removed] as a TIPS scholar. Although we have different professors, I think its neat that every [Removed] can all study the same content and help each other out. Please more practice problems and test - centered strategy tips! \n\n Dr. [Removed] is inoffensive and she effectively lectures and provides materials for us to be successful.","She's very personable and shares times from moments that she also made mistakes and it creates a comfortable atmosphere.","I think Dr. [Removed]'s class has a fair amount of course work, and the way he teaches make the material easy to understand.","Dr. [Removed] is super awesome.","He does really well advertising his office hours. I've been wanting to attend but unfortunately I do have work and other classes that get in the way","The test was very challenging overall. Many student failed","I like that Dr. [Removed] starts class by asking how we are or allowing us to spend a couple minutes talking about our peers about our weekend. It lightens the mood and gets us ready to start learning content.","He is a nice guy.","Really like how Professor [Removed] gives us lots of example problems and helps us solve them in class. I also like how her class is very consistent and she tells us what to expect for the upcoming week through her announcements.","I just feel like she goes to fast through her lectures.","Let people whisper, we're trying to understand course material as the lesson goes on. It may be a little distracting, but its a way for us to understand during lecture.","Dr. [Removed] has a good teaching style, the only negative part would be purchasing his textbook, but that is also part of his teaching format and therefore helpful regardless of its price.","There should be more background before jumping straight into college chemistry. Maybe the first week can serve as a review of the chemistry readiness modules.","He is very helpful and always guides you to the answer without actually giving it, which allows us to think and get to the answers on our own which helps us actually learn.","Very great professor and very helpful and knowledgeable","The instructor is extremely kind and understanding. She is always open to questions and always offers to help us in any way possible. I am really enjoying this class as a result, and I look forward to it every week.","No, she is a great lab instructor.","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind instructor who genuinely cares about her students. She sends out encouraging messages that help me feel better about the difficulty of learning genetics and helps to encourage me to continue. However, because of the limited amount of time during class, it can be hard to get clarifications on questions and lecture materials because there's only so much time we can spend on them. This leads to questions not being fully answered on our practice problems on [Removed].","He is good at breaking down problems and answering questions after class","I like that our professor wants us to strive in her class and if you need help she is more than happy to help.","I have thought that this class has been a great opportunity to develop a new set of skills and has been effective at helping to teach me to apply concepts in kinematics.","Dr. [Removed] spends a lot of time allowing students to work on practice problems and then goes over them, which is very helpful to me.","You're awesome, and I like your polos!","I think the instructor should work a little harder at making class interesting with real - world examples that reference pop culture if she is able to.","I think Dr. [Removed] is a great professor, and she really does prioritize our health and mental state and does everything she possibly can to make the college experience and class style as easy and adaptable as possible.","The instructor is very supportive and does not judge if we don't understand a concept, which is important to my learning experience.","She is always very kind and happy to answer any questions I am curious about and it makes ecology fun to learn.","Prof. [Removed] is excellent! Very organized course and teaches material in a way that is easy to understand. However, I feel like the grading criteria / requirements are not well outlined, which has resulted in loss of points on some assignments. I would appreciate having a rubric / grading outline for all / most assignments to prevent this problem.","I think the instapoll questions he gives in class are very helpful in improving our learning experience. It makes the stuff he covers in class “ stick ” and keeps us engaged ( which is very important for a 1.5 hr lecture ).","I like how Dr. [Removed] likes to share aspects of her life and always asks who we are doing / have been at the start of each lecture.","The instructor simply never talked about that sort of positivity.","No, Professor [Removed] is doing a good job in helping understanding through class activities   and collaboration outside of the class.","None that I can think of.","He reached out to me individually to ask about how I was doing and my performance in the class. Him doing that really means a lot to me, and it reassured me that I have support in this class.","He is very good at elaborating and going in depth into topics. He also explains many of the real life applications of what we learn and I think that is important.","I do not feel that this is necessary for a chemistry course, there is not a lot of other historical context that is delved into due to most important chemistry discoveries being held by white men.","I really appreciate how the instructor set up the [Removed] page. It is easy to navigate and additional help is easy to find - such as office hours.","Exam was not fun.","Not really, but he's good!","I feel that certain concepts are not fully explained and are brushed over, but these are concepts we need to succeed on in - class quizzes as well as exams.","I feel while Dr. [Removed] is a nice person, she also has issues teaching the material. I feel there isn't a point to the classes due to the fact she simply reads off of the slides with no deeper insight. The answers to the slide questions are updated later in class. \n\n During the one exam we had so far, she distracted myself and many others due to constantly calling students to return calculators, which while understandable I feel that if the students in class who didn't bring a calculator should've figured out something prior to the class. She also rushed the test immensely, putting stress on myself because I was still in line to sit down while she already started the test, and when I was seated she was unprepared and did not supply me with my papers immediately, and I had to wait until they printed off more.","Honestly, from past observations, a lot of office hours are hard to go to, like it's at inconvenient times and they get canceled and pushed back a lot when you try to make the time for it. Also, there are no practice exams or more practice to go from, the homework, square cap questions, and discussion worksheets are nice, but they make me feel unprepared for upcoming assignments.","I like how Professor [Removed] gave us motivation tips during exam week. However, I don't enjoy having to teach myself the material before we learn it in class because it makes me more confused.","I would like a bit more review material. I asked some upperclassmen about additional review material,   and they told me that they had access to an \" orange textbook \" which had additional practice questions.","The instructor is very accommodating to students and allows an opt - out option for lectures and discussions, offering a redistribution of grading percentages to not include attendance. Even though I prefer to attend in - person lectures, this practice made an impression on me because it showed that the professor was understanding of students' needs and understood that people learn differently.","just haven't seen it myself personally","This is a science course, and a very big class, so most of these things I'm ok with and it does not effect my performance in the course.","I wish practice tests were still provided, he used to. Other bio professors have their students getting above [Removed] on the tests yet our average was very low.","No, the instructor has not done anything else in class that I am inclined to point out or share.","She is very welcoming and makes a notoriously difficult course seem more doable, so I really appreciate the efforts she puts in doing that.","I enjoy this class! It is highly fast paced and takes 8 - 10 hours of outside work for me, but the topics are interesting and I enjoy struggling a bit.","Dr. [Removed] does an excellent job at explaining difficult statistics concepts, especially since there are many students who are seeing this content for the first time. She provides many opportunities for practice and assistance through office hours which makes me feel supported as I learn this topic.","The grading policy is not clear. You may lose points for some unexpected things.","No, but she is very welcoming and allows many opportunities for collaboration.","He's a very sweet guy and he is very well - versed on the subject matter.","Dr. [Removed] is always very kind and deeply cares about his students.","I love that Professor [Removed] gives half the points back on the exams. It helps me stay calm and less anxious when I take the exams, which ultimately makes me do better. I also think it establishes that students are more than just their test scores and builds a healthy relationship with learning. I think this shows how Professor [Removed] cares about the well - being of his students.","No! In regards to the last question, it didn't have an impact on my course experience because I knew my neighbors from high school. Overall, Dr. [Removed] has been a fine teacher.","I do not like the way my professor lectures. For an upper division course, I would expect her lecturing skills to be more polished. My [Removed] chem professors lecture at a better pace than her and explain things better","I really like how engaging the lectures are. The students are consistently part of the lecture through the in - class [Removed] questions and discussions. I think this is one of the best aspects of this class. It allows me to remain focused / engaged for a longer period of time.","No they are all very good.","I feel like [Removed]. [Removed] has done a great job so far!","I really like the class participation that is encouraged and the peer talking. It helps break up the lecture to be more engaging.","The main instructor has been extremely helpful and clear with directions when necessary.","The videos are recorded so that reviews are easy to do, and he pays attention to the class, enforcing students to pay attention or else they might miss out on key details.","Dr. [Removed] is very helpful and willing to work with students, which is something very important. He goes beyond to offer students better opportunities and is willing to help students find what works for them. The course is overall designed for you to apply concepts constantly so you are not forgetting previous concepts which helps students retain information thoroughly. Also the teacher's assistants and Dr. [Removed] are very helpful in class when it comes to answering questions and clearing confusion.","Really great professor","The instructor is extremely passionate about physics and has truly inspired me to be interested in the subject as well! The class is challenging, but professor [Removed] outlines the course in such a way where if you \" fail \", you have the opportunities to grow and learn from your mistakes. This has helped with reducing stress but also gives us a second chance to better understand the material! She is really an amazing compassionate professor!","I think one of the most beneficial things that the professor does for us is that she makes a list of the question types that will be on the exams. This gives us a clear, cut - out overview of what to expect and tells us exactly how to study which helps maximize my time and what the most important concepts are to review.","I like that he gives us an opportunity to ask questions on [Removed] throughout the lecture and will answer them once he is done.","She is a great professor.","The most impactful thing that Dr. [Removed] has said in lecture, in my opinion, is that no question is a stupid question. No matter what question someone asks, he is happy to answer it, and always does so in a way that makes sense. This sentiment that no question is a stupid question has empowered me to speak up in this class when I am usually pretty quiet in other classes, and I am sure other students feel the same.","I like how Dr. [Removed] offers a variety of ways to study for the test, including the square caps and discussion section worksheets.","It would be helpful for me if the pre - lab was open beginning on Friday so I could do it earlier over the weekend. It opens for my section on Sunday and I have to do it then because of my class schedule on Monday.","A lot of in class demonstrations made learning the current material much easier for myself.","She's a great person but I wish she would include some more information in her lecture slides. for example, types of gene interaction ( like additive ) was a question on the practice problems worksheet but I couldn't find it anywhere on the lecture slides. She briefly mentioned it in class but it was mainly from the textbook where we can learn the information","I enjoy that he is so relatable! He doesn't want anyone to be nervous or embarrassed.","I like how much resources my professor gives me for the exams. I just wished she went more in depth with the lectures and doesn't just go over what's already on the slides. I feel like I always need to reteach myself what she taught during the lectures instead of her teaching me.","I like the pace that she teaches at and I think the homework / quizzes are representative of what we are learning during class. I also think she gives the right amount of assignments to grasp the material and not any busy work.","  I think Professor [Removed] is one of the best mentors I have been taught by so far. She understands that us students are humans and extends an amount of grace that most professors do not. She allows for us to make up assignments and truly gives each student an equal opportunity to excel in her class.","I like how she has quiz reflections that help us earn back points","I think Professor [Removed] is approachable and kind which are some of the most important things a professor can be.","My instructor and the assistant are the best instructors I have ever met. They both truly help us learn and care about our genuine well - being.","Very well organized and awesome proffessor","I like my instructor and I like the structure of the course so far, so I'm interested in seeing what comes next","Yes. In the exam review on the exam day for midterm 1, a student asked a question about trophic efficiencies and rather than explain that huge point of confusion she laughed it off and said its rather simple. This had a strong negative feeling for me because not everyone is on her level of knowledge(obviously ) so if someone has a question she should approach it as if they know nothing rather than shrugging it off as simple.","She's been very supportive and is very nice. She wants her students to succeed and she's very easy to approach. I have never felt uncomfortable asking her questions.","He is a very nice professor ; he listens I can tell he is passionate about what he is talking especially when a student ask him something that he really can't explain in a bit.","I feel like Dr. [Removed]'s lectures are helpful most times, but they are a hit or miss. There is a part of it where his lectures do not relate to the topic, and the rest you have to prepare prior to class because he moves on from each topic way too quickly.","Na, I really enjoy Dr. [Removed]'s class","[Removed] is an amazing instructor who clearly cares about her students, both inside and outside of the classroom. She's very encouraging and represents a strong growth mentality. She's not shy to share her faults and failures during lectures to ensure the students that they're not alone, and to destigmatize the openness of one's failures. She truly is an inspiration and I hope to leave an impact on someone the way she does on her students.","[Removed] instapoll over squarecap pleaseee","Discussion sections would be better for reviewing the material more.","Suffering through the class because the test doesn't really reflect what you learn since your grade can go down with a simple mistake on a conceptual questions","[Removed] always makes sure that we are in a safe environment and that our concerns are valid and she provides a classroom where we can grow personally and professionally.","very interactive and positive professor, she s very good","I feel like he makes the class welcoming to everyone — although I'm not the type of student to ask questions during lecture in front of the whole class, I'm not scared to go ask him something after class, which is different from a lot of other physics classes that I've taken in the past. He really wants students to learn and it's shown through his teaching and grading style : he encourages discussion a lot, and his homeworks and exams' policy leave room for learning and understanding of the subject.","I like how many resources she provides us with to practice course concepts.","I wish she could slow down her teaching and make it more visually understandable.","She encourages us to keep learning and keep our eagerness to learn about chemistry going. She reiterates mistakes on exams although feel devastating are ok, and normal. She encourages us to utilize re - take opportunities and try for better results. She encourages us to prove to ourselves that we can do it.","No other information.","Professor [Removed] sometimes asks us how our weekends were, how our week is going, and likes to make some conversation with outside of the content we are focusing on in class.","I really enjoy being in Dr. [Removed]'s class. She is really knowledgeable in the field of genetics, and I enjoy going to her classes every week.","I appreciate how Professor [Removed] [Removed] tries to run physical demonstrations of the concepts we're talking about during lectures. It helps me better understand the material.","My professor was great. There is nothing in specific","My instructor tries to make it a fun environment in such a big class size. It can also make it difficult to cater to a lot of students, so there are many resources that are provided to help us succeed.","I strongly dislike how homework modules which take multiple hours to complete if you want to actually grasp the topic come out only 1 day prior to the due date. Also, I do not like that some notes that came out did not match other material provided from the course. Example/ different [Removed] values for differentiation between [Removed] and [Removed] bonds. Also, a few notes that came out had wrong information on them and had to be fixed later in the course. Obviously nothing is perfect, but I guess I just expected more from a university that costs 40,000 + a year. That being said though, the program tries very hard to make many resources and opportunities for students' success","He's very welcoming in office hours","She always asks us how she can do better or if we need help","She has seemed so caring and supportive throughout the past month and definitely emphasizes the importance of mental health and sleep which has made me feel like she genuinely cares and sees me as more than a student!","She is a very nice professor, and although she is sometimes very pushy about people participating during class ( I am too nervous to do so ), I appreciate her effort in having a more interactive class.","i really like how she has the question types for each unit and gives us ample resources to prepare for tests.","No, there's nothing else that I can think of to share.","Shoemaker tries her best to use demos for her lessons. She's very transparent about her work which makes me feel more comfortable with her as a person, not just a professor","there is nothing else","My instructor is constantly trying to improve the environment in which she teaches in, as I specifically notice that she wants to keep talking at a minimum throughout lecture. This helps students stay on track overall throughout lecture periods.","The quizzes are easy to understand and she goes over everything that will be on the quizzes and posts reviews and practices which is very helpful.","I like the way that my instructor has the class set up. I think that the learning modules that are required before class that cover what will be in the lecture help me learn a lot better. She also explains everything in common language and thoroughly enough so that it is easier to understand. She also provides many resources for studying when exams come up, and makes sure to prepare us for what is going to be on the exam and the question types.","We typically stay on task with the curriculum and stay focused during class.","It would be nice if she did not go so fast on lectures. She does very well on everything else.","The only thing is that I got [Removed] and had to quarantine for a whole week, but I still had to sacrifice my free absence days even though I wasn't allowed to be in class, otherwise I would get others sick. I believe that for medical reasons, even if we have allowances for missing class, it should not consume these days in case you have a personal emergency etc.","He kind of just jumps into problems with the assumption that we know most of the math concepts beforehand, which can sometimes leave me feeling a bit confused.","Prof [Removed] has been great so far, and her class is very organized. I love how she explains the concepts we go over in class, making them seem much for simple. She is also very approachable!","I think Dr. [Removed] is amazing professor, but I do think he could help in making the material slightly easier to understand. I have talked to my peers and a group of us do think that he does run through the material rather fast, which is understandable, but tends to not elaborate on what he is talking about in words that people without background knowledge would understand. He does go very in depth and it is very evident that he loves what he does which really helps me stay engaged.","He's good at answering questions. If he doesn't know the answer of the top of his head, he'll research it and answer it in another class.","No, I will keep it to myself","My instructor is great, she provides a lot of information and source for us to do good in this course. \n","I think his lectures are too fast paced to retain enough information. However, the TA led discussions are helpful.","I would like it if we had more opportunity to work together.","The lectures are highly unorganized and students are expected to know all the material prior to being exposed to it in any form. Additionally, the professor constantly pauses lectures to yell at the students to be quiet when the lecture hall is already silent, thereby wasting the students time as multiple concepts, that covered a fifth of the first exam, were not discussed in class before the exam.","I believe the instructor is stated at the beginning that this was the first year teaching thermodynamics ( I might be making this up ) so some of the questions were hard to answer or not possible considering this fact.","She is really soft - spoken and students take advantage of that so the class is really loud at times and it is a bit distracting","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor!","Good instructor, gives lot of resources to succeed in the class.","She kind of motivated me to keep going and try to do better in her course. She explained that if you didn't get a score that you liked on an Exam, leave it in the past and don't let it discourage you. She said all it's going to do is create a pessimistic look that potentially makes you feel that way for future tests to come. Ultimately, she said to just use this as a fresh start to try and do better for the next exam to come.","Professor [Removed] has done a great job at structuring the course with well thought out lectures and assignments that help students learn R along with the theory behind data science.","She expects every student to know what she knows, so rather than actually teaching us, she skims over everything because she just assumes we have the same knowledge as her. I have learned 99 % of the class entirely on my own.","My instructors have been very nice and helpful. [Removed] also plays music in the background while we work. Her music taste is a little generic but I'm not complaining.","I am satisfied with my professor.","He genuinely shows how much he likes physics in class and always listens to his students","Just that she is very strict and detail oriented with grading and although I see her reasoning, the amount of coursework for a lab and my other 4 classes is a lot and the smallest of mistakes does not seem fair to take off such large sums off of the grades","She has been very sweet, understanding, approachable and made my first lab less underwhelming. I also had to miss many labs due to illness and she was understanding and made the experience very low stress.","Dr. [Removed] is a very well rounded professor.","At times it seems like important information is said so fast that I can not write it down or type it fast enough. It could be helpful to repeat key ideas so there is time to absorb it.","The instructor consistently offers advice on class topics and provides many examples. Additionally, the instructor does not leave the students to fend for themselves over questions, instead they lead us through them and toward the correct answer without explicitly saying the answer.","I would like it if Dr. [Removed] would take more time to explain the “ why ” of things that occur content wise but other than that it's fine.","I think he is a very understanding professor, it is nice to have someone who believes that all his students are capable of succeeding. I do think he has a lot of knowledge on topics which can make it harder to understand when asking him a question because it can often lead to more confusion.","I might be mistaken, but in the instructor's syllabus, it doesn't seem like he added information concerning mental health, but this does not mean that he does not support the aid thereof.","She honestly is a good professor i just sometimes she would understand   that we are new to this environment and we don't always know what is happening.","I really love how the instructor seems like she loves the content she is teaching.","He seems like a very genuine guy who wants us to succeed but I am not sure he has the experience that allows him to know where our key points of struggle tends to be.","The lectures are nice but I often feel somewhat unprepared for the test even though I've used all the resources given, including active recall.","She is very patient and kind! \n","Professor [Removed] is extremely kind, caring, and truly wants the best for her students!","I don't really like the 12 multiple choice question format of the exams. I think some partial credit is important, especially on complex algebraic problems.","The class itself is very challenging and I am doing much better than I thought that I would have been, but the class is extremely fast paced and I feel that I am falling behind no matter what. We only had five classes between exam 1 and exam 2, which is hard for me to understand what I had gotten wrong in the last exam and prepare for the next upcoming one. So there is a sense of being overwhelmed in that class.","Dr. [Removed] is an excellent professor he just moves very quickly.","I liked having practice exams. It was useful in preparing for the actual exams.","She is very nice and has a lot of resources for students who need extra practice for the exams or just over content.   This is very important for students because she even provides practice exams that are harder than the actual exam that makes students feel more comfortable and ready for the exam.   Only critique would be the learning modules, I would just like an announcement that there are more than usual learning modules to complete and when they are posted since some are posted later than expected.","Being open - minded and listening to what we had to say about the confusing exam question then promptly discussing it to the whole class the same day and giving us points back made me feel like he cares. He seems more approachable now and I feel like going to more office hours could be good learning","Barely any professors do this, but Dr. [Removed] talking about her life experiences and struggles really makes her approachable and relatable. I believe many teaching individuals underestimate this skill. Dr. [Removed] does bring random life events. The life events she talks about is to either reassure or motivate us. This has made it less stressful to learn physics. Also she is incredibly positive and optimistic. This aspect of her is very contagious and that is a good thing.","I love how Professor [Removed] creates an environment where I feel comfortable to ask as many questions as I need to in order to understand a concept.","The pace of the units that we've covered has been very unbalanced. It felt like we had an abundance of time for our first unit, but our second unit feels rushed.","I really enjoy how engaging my professor makes the lectures. Most other classes are not hands - on, but this one allows me to learn by doing, which is how I have always learned best. I appreciate her commitment to making sure everyone understands what is going on.","In - class quiz questions should come from the things we learn from the lecture, not from the modules or readiness assignments.","she is great and i love her class","I need practice exams, and he does not give anything. Also, the textbook has typos.","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind professor. He provides informative lectures in addition to very helpful office hours. My struggle with the course lies in understanding what the correct formula / approach is for a problem. I feel like the material before the first exam was better explained than the material currently, as I am now starting to have issues with formula identification. I may just require more exposure to the material.","Throughout [Removed] School, [Removed] was something I struggled with. Going into [Removed] now, I was very nervous. However, Dr. [Removed]'s is an incredible professor, and she has helped me understand [Removed] on a level I previously deemed impossible.","Not necessarily.","He's actually a good professor my only complaint would be how fast he goes on the lectures and how soon he starts the next unit after just finishing the last. I am studying a new unit while trying to understand the next one and it is pretty hard.","No, not really? I think my instructors ( Dr. [Removed] and [Removed] ) are very nice.","I think the ability to do test corrections and get points back on exams is extremely beneficial to my experience in the course. I feel it allows me to stress less and it also ensures I learn the material.","Dr. [Removed] is the first professor I have had at [Removed] that is not afraid to talk about her past failures. I feel that she truly understands the struggles her students are facing and wants to help them as much as possible.","I like how she brings her own failures and perspective of physics and learning into the classroom and makes us not feel alone if we are struggling.","My instructor has offered a lot of materials for preparing for exams which is very helpful.","I wish she would spend more time fully explaining topics as if we have no prior experience, rather than just brushing over it slightly and teaching things as if we already know what we're doing. Even though we have learning modules, I learn better when I'm being taught in person.","I think the course is easy but sometimes I feel like the professor goes too fast.","I think this class is very informative on expectations and the level of coursework required. This helps us all to understand what is expected of us and how our research applies to work done in everyday research in higher organizations.","I liked how much he stressed the important concepts.","He had a very uplifting positive attitude","She has done a great job so far! I would love more help with conceptual problems","I enjoy how much he cares how the students are actually doing.","I am very happy to have my professor in particular, it is a tough class and she makes it much easier to understand through thorough notes, lectures, and take - home assignments.","I think Dr. [Removed] is a really nice professor. he is approachable and I would feel comfortable expressing concerns to him and I feel like he would actually care and try to help the student. he seems to care about the material a lot but breaks it down nicely and doesn't overwhelm us too much.","She always checks in for anyone who has questions which makes me feel very comfortable.","Dr. [Removed] is very clear with what she expects from us but does not leaves us hanging. She always provide additional resources, such as muddiest points of the week review, practice exams, and study guides, to ensure we do our best in her course. To me, this is imperative for my success as I benefit a lot from studying resources provided directly from the professor. Dr. [Removed] has been nothing short of a wonderful professor.","He's overall energy and mood during class is positive. He's very passionate about physics and he's actions shows that.","Even though the class they teach is a topic that is very challenging for me and something I dreaded having to take in college, the professor has made the class feel welcoming and supportive. I would not be afraid to approach them to ask questions or provide feedback.","- My professor has made a lot of office hours and community study sessions available which i find extremely helpful \n - she's very sweet and easy to approach and talk to \n - the class can sometimes get boring but I still enjoy the material \n - I find it really helpful that she makes the lectures interactive so that we can learn from and teach our peers.","I believe this instructor is very fair and she is really good at explaining things in office hours.","The way he carries the class being able to joke with us but also keep it serious when needed. I also really like the ice breakers and activities we do to get the students active and get to know one another.","Her class has us collaborate with our table mates every day. She will also often start the class with small check - ins or ice breakers. I feel that this has been something very important to me because she has made the class much more comfortable to be in.","The class is challanging but I truely in joy it","He is very open about his life and interests and makes himself feel like a genuine, familiar person rather than just a course professor. This has been pretty important for me and made the class more enjoyable, even if it has minimal relevance to our work.","The instructor is very specific with the content she lectures about. There is a formal structure to how to both her lectures and the study materials she posts for us. This made me feel more prepared to master the content of each unit.","Something that I appreciate is that our professor understands our situation as a student. In the syllabus and on the first day of class setting expectations, she mentioned how she values progress over perfection. This was really important to me because it can be hard to aim for perfection especially at a higher education level. However, with the help of others that this course provides I feel more open to learning and not closed off. It's okay to make mistakes and it's valuable to learn what learning styles / studying techniques are the most beneficial to you. As I go into college, I have learned a lot about myself and this course has made me feel more comfortable in adapting to the change.","I believe she does a great job of explaining physics concepts to the very core. She offers / explains several ways of approaching a problem, and is always willing to help us understand concepts we struggle with.","He is a good professor he gives all the resources needed it is up to you to learn how to use the resources and be able to apply them to tests.","I am very happy and excited about the way this course is structured! Thank you!","I think I was just nervous for exam one and that the concepts were pretty fair considering what we were supposed to know.","Dr. [Removed] is not just a knowledgeable professor in physics but also very interactive and humorous with his students. I believe this is an extremely important quality that fosters learning more than one would imagine.","I think professor [Removed] maintains a pretty professional relationship with her students during lecture. I'm unaware of what she is like during smaller settings like office hours because I have yet to attend one. I've attended her TA's office hours and they are competent and know what they're talking about!","I love Professor [Removed]! She reminds me of a mother figure because she is just so caring towards all her students. I also love the classroom textbook we are currently using... it is very helpful for the class. Dr. [Removed] provides countless resources for all her students and much flexibility within her course. \n\n  Sometimes, however, I have a difficult time comprehending the lectures(not because of the professor ), simply because I am a slower learner. I will sometimes compare myself to my classmates and wonder why am I not able to keep up with them. The [Removed] can be difficult for me to understand, so I sometimes just go with what answers my friends pick. But that's okay, I know that this is just part of my learning how to study in college. In AP [Removed], I only relied on memorization. In this class, there is a much higher need to understand, and I am still working to adapt to that. \n\n I'm hoping that in the future, Dr. [Removed] could make attending class optional. I feel a high level of responsibility to attend all my classes ; however, in genetics, I struggle to comprehend the lectures. What I prefer to do is self - study the textbook, attempt the problems on my own, and then watch the recorded lecture. I feel that the class lecture makes me more overwhelmed since I know that I won't be able to understand it so clearly. However, I am currently working on a new method of reading the textbook chapters before class so that I can continue to go to lectures. We'll see what works better! :) \n\n That is my input for the class itself ; Professor [Removed] is perfect, and I wouldn't change anything about her!","I like how Professor [Removed] allows us to learn from our mistakes. This helps foster an inclusive and safe learning environment.","The instructor seems good. I like this course. The organization is great for [Removed], assignments, and [Removed], which is very important to me. The attendance policy is also lenient, which is also very important to me, as I do my best learning with homework / assignments as opposed to lectures.","This professor will talk about the importance of mental and emotional wellness and how it ties into academic success, and ties in her own experiences with it. I think this has been very beneficial and is very relevant and relatable to alot of students, and personally I have found that it makes me feel more understood, motivated, and relaxed when learning. I greatly appreciate this and think it's great!","I like how the professor and TA's are constantly walking around the lab and are available for asking questions throughout the whole lab period.","This is a [Removed] course ; I see no issue with this. We're here to learn [Removed] and that's what our Professor teaches us","I really liked talking about the applications of what learned in class. In addition whenever I ask a question the professor always makes it feel like a valid question.","Dr. [Removed] is a big fan of the growth mindset and I appreciate that he acknowledges that physics can be difficult for some students, but you can still learn and become proficient at it.","The professor redirected us to the [Removed] health center and advised therapy. The professor did not appear to be able to help students individually outside of academics.","Sometimes she will make a comment in class that I think isn't necessary. I like her a lot as a professor but once or twice she s made a comment along the lines of \" women shouldn't gain weight \" or \" women don't want to gain weight \" as maybe a way of relating course material to our lives? But it's a dated sentiment and it's a bit upsetting to hear in the middle of a lecture. One time specifically I can remember is in class we we're talking about consumption efficiency and how carnivores have a higher consumption efficiency and then said something along the lines of about how predators will eat whenever possible \" which is not what we would think as people because we usually don't want to gain weight \", or something along those lines, and about how women specifically will understand. Yeah I just don't think that pushes a good ideal at all on female students we're all just there to learn not to feel bad about ourselves. Once again I love this professor and would not want her to get in trouble for this, I just think its something that should be pointed out.","I think the instructor's positive attitude and just overall joy for what they do makes you want to show up to class everyday.","I would say that Professors [Removed] [Removed] and [Removed] [Removed] are good chemistry teachers. They each have different approaches to how they teach but I would recommend either.","The instructor is very knowledgable on the content, but sometimes explains difficult concepts quickly or in confusing terms. I am not sure if other students feel similarly.","He is a great teacher","I LOVE [Removed] [Removed] \n","I think the amount of resources and help available is very useful as if you don't pick up on how something works in a lecture, it can be easy reviewed using the resources.","Dr [Removed] is a helpful teacher when it comes to answering specific questions and explaining the contextual larger picture of what is being taught in lecture.","I feel like we don't get through the slides enough. Class will be half way over and were not even half way through the slides. And then she has to rush through the rest. Also I don't like how we have quizzes on material we just learned that day. I understand that may be personal issue.","He is very consistent on his teaching method, which made me feel little more confident to adopt to college way of studying.","I feel as though the professor, other than the textbook, does not provide any material to review lectures before class, and often times the lectures don't have the same material as the textbook. I also feel like the material covered in class does not translate directly to the assignmentd we have to do, requiring more extra researching.","I overall like the internal structure of the course","Gets distracted fast by students “ talking ”. I never hear anyone speaking but if that s a problem maybe asking students to not talk at the beginning of class.","The professor overall encourages a welcoming and positive learning environment.","I feel like it's difficult when professors assume that everyone already knows stuff about the content. It's kind of defeating when you actually don't know anything about it. Sometimes when people asks questions and are confused about the content, she says that it's easy and doesn't see how they're confused about the content but for most people, this is their first experience to this content which makes them feel stupid.","I really appreciate how encouraging and nonjudgmental she is when helping us with the content.","Sometimes Dr. [Removed] goes really fast during lectures so sometimes it would be nice if he paused so we could have a second to write everything down.","No, I feel he is a lovely man and a great professor.","No I do not have anything else to share.","professor [Removed] seems to really care about her students and encourages us to keep trying even when things feel hard, which is highly valued","I just really enjoy all the resources that she provides. It makes a scary class feel less scary.","Professor [Removed] is an excellent professor. I really am enjoying her class.","Not really, I don't have anything. Dr. [Removed] is a good professor once a freshman gets accumlated to college coursework. It may seem challenging, but Dr. [Removed] and her team really prepare everyone for the exams.","I really enjoy this class and would recommend this teacher.","She is a good professor considering the large lecture hall. I wish she'd teach faster and actually get through all the material.","I think I feel good about the instructor and class so far. I like the course structure and the lecture style, and I think the instructor does a good job at being an instructor.","Dr. [Removed] is super interactive and a great professor! She makes a very hard class enjoyable and even when times are tough, I know she believes that I can succeed!","Dr. [Removed] is amazing and definitely one of my favorite if not my favorite professors. She is so kind and truly cares about her students. I feel that the material can be challenging and fast - paced at times, but I really benefit from her office hours and discussion sections. She makes class so fun and interesting, and she is an amazing professor to have especially as a freshman.","Dr. [Removed] is really nice and you can tell she cares about us! She provides us with many resources to help our studies and is always willing to help.","One thing that makes this class more difficult is that the instructor kind of just reads through some of the slides rather than actually explaining why things are how they are.","He is extremely helpful and cares about his students. I went to office hours and he went above and beyond to help me finish the problem. He is an amazing professor.","Dr. [Removed] handles the course well considering its size.","I really appreciate this teaching team and all their support!","I really liked all the resources for exams that set us up for success. It helps knowing what's going to be on the exams and what we should be learning.","I like how Dr. [Removed] is open to answer as many questions she can in class, and after the class ends she always encourages people to come to her office hours if they need help.","Everything has been super helpful, esp in class demos and the hw being due every week helps solidify the knowledge \n\n\n","i wish the emergency drops would be for my personal use rather than faults with the websites","I have nothing to share.","The instructors are very thoughtful and obviously care a lot about the students and make sure that everyone feels heard and understood. This has made the classroom a very inclusive and supportive environment where the students are able to fully express their opinions and feel comfortable enough to share their own thoughts and experiences with the whole class.","I like that our instructor tries to help us out with certain things that may be on the upcoming test or quiz. However, I do think the class is a little unorganized but overall, I think it a very informative class.","His general demeanor is very welcoming and respectful. He seems to understand very well what it is like to be a student","I feel as though not much has been done to have a significant impact on my feelings towards college or the class.","I would like for them to be more engaging with the students and have more practice problems throughout.","She does a lot of good practice examples with us that usually appear in quizzes and examns.","This professor has been the most understanding with students, she gives many opportunities to do better in her class and always cares about what people think. She always tries to improve as a professor and acts on it, instead of ignoring students' concerns. Best professor I have had so far in my undergrad years.","He gives good examples that directly correlate with the homework on [Removed]. This makes the homeworks so much more manageable.","Not really - he's very good at his job and has one of the best teaching styles I've encountered in my past 3 years here.","I love my instructor he provides lots of info that we need that is going to be on the test","This lab, along with its TA's make the environment stress free and a wonderful time. I feel like [Removed] and [Removed] make the naturally stale and monotone lab environment a fun and meaningful experience. I think that if more lab TA's were as laid back and open to mistakes as [Removed] and [Removed] are labs would be a much better overall experience.","I think there needs to be in person review lectures weekly","I love Professor [Removed], as she's a great person and very knowledgeable, but she sometimes teaches very fast and doesn't account for students to not fully grasp a topic. Even if a few students understand a topic she moves on.","Dr. [Removed] is very thoughtful and truly wants us to do well in her class. She's a great professor.","Nothing really. Dr. [Removed] has been a great professor so far and I like how he really tries to connect us to the course with things like demos or space stuff.","Dr. [Removed] cares a lot about his students and you can tell that he is both passionate about biology and teaching. It makes the class more enjoyable.","That one time Dr. [Removed] passed out cough drops to students who were coughing made me feel like he genuinely cares about his students' well being","She is a good instructor, just sometimes difficult to follow exactly what points she is intending to get across.","Nothing in particular. I mostly am at school to learn whether the professor makes these acknowledgments or not does not influence that.","During the first two weeks she asked us to talk to the people sitting next to us about something, I am not too sure what it was, but I remember it actually being a very awkward conversation with the people around me and I would have liked a more like lighthearted or fun discussion question.","He doesn't do much, he reviews the slides and adds a couple items of note that are not included on the slides or textbook, but the relevancy of said notes are unclear. Alongside this, understanding him is a challenge as a result of his accent, tone, and speed of his talking voice. I hear and fully understand every couple words, taking notes with this is more difficult than it should be as I often mishear and misunderstand what he says during lecture.","Very accommodating and understanding that not everything will click the first go around so she takes time to review every class.","N / A I love her!","She does a great job!","She is a good teacher but her writing isn't legible.","Giving us a wealth of resources to study and review with has been really helpful in coping with the workload of a college course","I think the resources provided along with the course are very helpful and important to succeeding in the class.","The instructor is very approachable and understanding.","I want this course to have better slides and lecture material as most of the course is self - guided. I would also appreciate it if the textbook was revised as there are so many mistakes in it and for the price that it is sold to students it is horrendous that that quality is what we are receiving. The textbook needs to be better written and have quality content rather than confusing students with the lack of cohesiveness. The most helpful things in this class have been my TA and his notes as they prepare me for the exams as the Professor does not release practice tests or ways to study for the exam.","No, that will be all.","She makes small talk with us and cares to try to learn our names which I find super sweet and it also keeps me engaged in class because I feel like I am heard in the classroom.","Assignments were posted inconsistently, with many longer modules being posted the day before they were supposed to be due relatively late in the day. This put me and many other students in a bind before lectures.","i do not like how we do not get to choose our own lab groups for lab. i am working with someone who does not do anything and talks too much, so lab is very unenjoyable for me.","I think that she lectures too slow, she's not good at managing time we never get to go over all the material in lecture. However, I do feel like the resources and other aspects of the class make up for it and make it easy to succeed. That just would be my only compliant.","I would like him to improve on his teaching during the lectures, focusing on explaining the material as if it is new rather than reviewing it like we already know the information.","Sawyer is just a really great personality and brings a sort of comfort to the lab setting, doesn't feel like she is talking down to us or is better than us in any way, and this makes for a more inclusive learning environment.","The instructor can move a bit fast at times but overall good professor.","I have come back to Professor [Removed] to take [Removed] [Removed] after taking [Removed] [Removed] I really like her teaching style and easy communication, and I was so happy that I'd be able to take another class with her.","No I am grateful for my amazing TA and instructor.","She really loves to respond to [Removed] discussion questions about course content very thoughtfully. All her posts have some sort of extra material whether it be a picture or links to related resources, which is above and beyond.","I think so far in my academic journey, Professor [Removed] course policies are the best. There are few difficult things for me that I would like to be addressed. For example, I'm a commuter student. I drive from 1hr everyday to get to campus. I wish If there was way for me to still participate in the class without having to show up to campus every day because frankly its very tiring to drive every day for an hour to get to campus. Perhaps lectures online or online zoom availability for commuting students can be a great thing.","The instructor is helpful with recommending and supplying resources for students to use. Take initiative over your studies and you'll be fine.","I think [Removed] is a great instructor and so is the TA. They are helpful and kind. Very encouraging and inspiring","I appreciate that the instructor makes an effort to discuss with students during lectures ( through lecture handouts to be done in groups ), rather than simply talking / lecturing at us.","The professor often goes very quickly through the material and gauges the understanding of students on a topic through the understanding of the overall group. This in my situation at least is not over all inclusive of my learning experience as I often feel behind my class / groupmates. Furthermore, I wish she would record the lectures. I know she does the mini - videos in the modules that cover most of the material covered in class, but having the actual in class lectures would help. Often times important information about the topic we're discussing in the class comes organically from the professor and is at times not emphasized when it really should be in the mini - videos like it is in class.","She alwasy seems to say for everyone to stop the whispering and how its a distraction however I never hear any whispering and her repeating for it to stop is more of a distraction and we tend to move slower. It seems like she is more bothered by it than anyone else in the class.","I really enjoy this course and the experiences I am gaining.","The resources he provides us with before exams are helpful. He tells us what concepts we need to know.","No, other than mentioning the feedback surveys for extra credit, she rarely talks about anything other than the lecture material and her own experience in the field of chemistry.","No I don't have anything.","Overall, the Dr. [Removed] seems to be one of the better, if not best options to take for engineering physics. I have heard that most of the physics professors at [Removed] are not great ; however, Dr. [Removed] seems to be a rare exception. He cares for his students, and he really wants to have as much of an open discussion and dialogue class as possible. Professors need to prioritize engaging their students over vomiting as much information onto them as possible, and Dr. [Removed] definitely does a great job of this.","I feel that my instructor is a very approachable person. I tend to be introverted and don't like to ask questions, but as I went to his office hours I was more engaged in learning and wanted to ask more questions. Even on days I didn't have anything to ask, going to his office hours and just listening to his responses to other peoples questions was very helpful.","The slideshows she creates are incredibly helpful. The situation is complicated but to be short I came in knowing nothing. I had to learn what a valence electron was, then how the periodic table works, then how to combine and integrate knowledge to create things like [Removed] [Removed]. This class assumes that I already know all these things, but even though I don't I have still been able to catch up pretty successfully. But those weekly 5 question quizzes are the worst little grade [Removed] of all time.","I appreciate how he goes over problems with us to make sure we have a good understanding of all the concepts.","I wish that with the quizzes that the bank of questions was 30 max instead of around 80 when the actual quiz only utilizes 3 of those questions in total.","The way Dr. [Removed] teaches is very difficult for me because he just flys through the slides so I do not learn much. However the discussion class is very helpful for me. There are lots of resources that help a lot and I really like how Dr. [Removed] believes in all of us.","No, thank you for teaching us!","Post the lecture slides before the class on Wednesday so we are able to a study before the quiz.","[Removed] was an amazing instructor, made sure we had the guidance and reassurance that we needed, created an inviting space to be in, and allows us as students to learn while not worrying if we will make mistakes.","This instructor is very open - minded and has a wide variety of curriculum she covers so that we are well - rounded, aware students not only in the genetics class but as a whole on this campus.","The demonstrations and examples given in lecture are beneficial in helping me to connect the ideas and concepts that are taught in lecture to a real life experience. Furthermore, the questions given in lecture are challenging, yet provoke thought and allow me to reinforce the concepts that are being introduced","The questions on the weekly quizzes are worded really confusingly.","Not that I can think of!","He's just a very cool and nice person and I appreciate how generous he is with what can be graded and allowing corrections on exams which is an encouragement of possible failure and an allowing of failure to be ok at the same time.","Breaking things down step - by - step helps to better digest the information while also feeling less overwhelmed!","The instructor is a great speaker with incredible charm.","I absolutely love how supportive the teaching team is, and how even outside of class they are so supportive. They send us weekly affirmations and tell us to take care of ourselves. The connection the teaching team makes to the students is far beyond what I've seen other teams do ; Dr. [Removed]'s team excels at it.","I believe that Professor [Removed] does a great job in regard to resources outside of class, such as academic communities and Friday recitations. I greatly appreciate the current grading structure of the course, as it encourages us to reattempt and grasp concepts, even if it doesn't come easily the first time. I do wish that the learning modules were discussed in class a bit more, bridging what we learn outside of class to relevant examples in the lecture. I also think that if more time was given to work out examples during class, I would feel more confident in my understanding of a specific concept outside of class.","  I am having a difficult time in this class because I feel like it is so hard to do well on the tests. Since they are only 12 question multiple choice, if you miss 1 question you're already at an A- and if you miss 2 questions you're at a [Removed] I think in the future, it would be a lot more beneficial to students if the tests included more problems so there is more room for error. In addition, I think more practice problems similar to what will be on the test would be helpful to students as well.","She is down to earth, and will tell you what you need to know in many different ways so that if you are even half way awake you will get what you need to know, and so that makes me feel like I can do well in the class. It is quite frankly incredible, the effort she puts in.","Lectures are enjoyable through the use of many demos and instapolls where you can analyze the problems with your peers.","No my instructor is quite adequate and does a good job of passing out material to study","No, Dr. [Removed] is just all around great!","The professor oftentimes asks us to talk to our peers around us about an unfamiliar concept to make sure we understand, however if you sit next to people who are equally as confused as you are then this is not beneficial, and she will oftentimes simply move on expecting that we all understand when that is usually not the case.","no. She s been very great!!","I do not believe so.","No, I believe I added all that I needed to add.","Dr. [Removed] is comfortable with making jokes and laughing a bunch in class, which makes the learning environment feel so much more friendly.","No I think I said everything, she's a great professor and really knows how to teach difficult topics in a manner that's easily interpreted.","I like the squarecap question polling during class. I find the problems at the beginning of class to be excitingly challenging, and I find the problems during class to be helpful in reinforcing the material of the class.","I appreciate that he tries to do a lot of demonstrations that help pull the physics content \" from the page into the real world. \"","He is very straightforward with how he grades and what he expects and I like that","no i really enjoy dr satas class","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind man who is visibly passionate about biology. Unfortunately, his lectures are confusing, and the resources given to learn are limited and unhelpful. Most students rely on the textbook and outside resources - such as [Removed] videos - to stay caught up with the material.","I really like how the professor always comes to class with a positive attitude and a clear excitement to discuss the topics.","1 believe the instructor should open the prelabs 96 hours before the first lab of the week. Additionally, 1 do not believe we should do quizzes but rather more practical examinations as those will curry on for future lab courses.","I wish the practice questions were helping to the tests...","The first week could've been slowed done a little it went kind of fast for new material, but since then we have moved at a good pace.","I feel sometimes my instructor takes too long answering people's questions about things that aren't relevant to the course. I think sometimes he should say that their should be no more questions so we can learn relevant material.","Super considerate and genuinely cares about your learning and overall wellbeing inside and outside of class.","Nothing I can think of at the moment.","I like how our professor solves some example problems during the lecture. It helps me understand the material more.","I really like that there is an option to not have to ask questions out loud but rather through ed discussion, which makes it easier for me","The instructor always has practice questions given to us after discussing a concept. He always encourages us to discuss with our classmates about any questions we may have. He then goes over the questions and gives time for any additional questions we may have.","Dr. [Removed] provides extra credit opportunities, which I appreciate. It is more important for me to achieve excellence rather than perfection. I had a professor in the past implement \" zombie questions \" on exams. This is when they include the most missed problems on the next exam. I think this method ensures that students learn from their mistakes and is more effective than adding a curve or bonus points on an exam.","I think the professor spends a lot of time on the easier topics and will blow over the more difficult parts. It can definitely be confusing to understand because she will often only teach the way she prefers but it is still a way to get it done. I also think the learning modules assigned are very, very long, it is content heavy which can make it hard to stay motivated. There are many TAs that walk around to answer questions. The professor also doesn't like for us to talk while she is lecturing, understandable but at the same time, it helps to talk with other students while we are being taught to fully grasp the content. In the end, it is just an introduction to [Removed] so it is going to be a larger class but I think there needs to be more understanding towards the student's side.","She's a great professor and very open to talking with her students. I like the way she presents information in lectures and how she uses instapolls during class to help us practice.","I really like how the instructor has office hours that allow me to get additional help that I need. When I went, there were few students, and she would come to me making sure that I had all my questions answered. She would also frequently check up on me to ensure I was on the right track. I really appreciated how helpful she was.","Professor is a great chemistry professor for dealing with a very large class","There is far too much content covered in such a short period, and lectures are sometimes rushed since they are only an hour long each. There are also things stated in the syllabus that are not provided for students to prepare for exams, such as practice exams ( besides the last - minute one from a TA ).   [Removed], the professor is incredible, but he could do more to help his students learn better and succeed in the class.","She is a great professor with a clear grading structure.","I really like all of the resources the instructor gives us in this class, as it really enriches my understanding of concepts and prepares me for exams well.","I always feel great and relaxed when an instructor reminds me that I can always get in contact with them for help because I don't feel as overwhelmed by the course.","She will ask the TA's to NOT answer question while she lectures. Then why are they there!???","Most of my friends failed the first test despite having prepared well. I think the instructor might have covered more in - depth the sort of material which would be on the exam.","I really like the way Dr. [Removed] has structured the course. The worksheets have been great help, as I have always been the type to learn best by example. It really helps to look back on previous work. I like that we use R [Removed] instead of copying our code on a separate doc like I had to do in other classes, and I like that it is predominantly project based and \" learn as you go \". As someone with test anxiety I feel this is the best way for me to truly show my skills.","I really love how Dr. [Removed] arrange the course material per unit. It is very neat and reachable. So, its easier for us to study.","[Removed] cut course for the most part, but would be nice to have a better understanding on how assignments are graded.","He's a great professor!","She made the lab very homey because the ta's and her interact with us a lot and are very kind \n","I liked that my instructor did an introductory note card assignment for participation points and I also like that he has the opportunity for us to redo exam questions for half points back.","I wish we would get more organized and less broad review content so that I could prepare deeper for relevant topics and not spend as much time on things that are going to be more surface level so I could be more productive.   I like how for chemistry we are provided specific question types and practice problems so we know what specific topics are relevant for each issue.","I believe an exam drop would be better for the students than a retest. I say this because we have other exams to study for around the time we take these physics exams. Adding an exam on top of that seems stressful. Another thing I would say is to be more aware of the interactions the TA is having with the students.","The instructor isn't great at explaining all concepts and having to do majority independent work to get the material.","I have overall enjoyed the structure of this class","Dr. [Removed] is a fantastic professor. She is one of, if not the best professor when it comes to answering and explaining questions, no matter how stupid it may be. She is very patient, thoughtful, and her organization skills do not go unnoticed as it helps me manage and understand the class very well.","For the last four questions, this is a science class.   Other than talking about who did what, we can not really go into that much detail.   I think he does a really good job teaching us what we need to know for our future classes.","Overall, the course has been challenging and engaging.","The instructor has greatly contributed to my success in this course.","I think she is a great teacher and explains her content very well.","She is a very excellent professor. I like all the resources she provides on her canvas page for the exams. I also like that we can retake up to two exams, which takes a lot of pressure off.","He is a good professor, very thorough in lecture.","Professor [Removed] spent a lot of time making sure we understood the basic concepts before moving on to the more complex ones.","Not that I can think of","I appreciated how respectful my instructor was.","she is a really good in teaching and provide us with insides on how to do well on the test. i am really happy to be her student","Sometimes the professor can be a little unclear on expectations when asking us to do questions on our own. I think it would be helpful for her to sometimes nudge us in the right direction before giving us time to work on it. Overall though, professor [Removed] is very approachable and kind.","I am not the biggest fan of [Removed] - I think it is just people saying things in a \" void \". I understand that we have an ethics flag but there has to be a better way. Honestly it feels like an echo chamber, and it is without any nuance. Also, it's like 500 people so if there is a strong chance someone has already said what you want to say.","The current layout works wonderfully and helps to not put much stress on one's workload. It does extremely help that the deadlines are set for 11:59 PM or an hour before class and that quizzes are based on pre - labs so as to not overexert us.","All content is extremely organized and student expectations are very clearly stated.","I love her teaching style, however I wish she would go in more detail during lecture instead of just skimming through it quickly","Dr. [Removed] is a very caring professor and genuinely hopes the best for her students. She provides us with a lot of studying material and class content. She provides learning objectives for each chapter of the book we are learning, so we know what to focus on during lecture and for the exams.","I like that most lectures she starts with announcements and talks about her journey with her sense of belonging during her college years, as I find it very relatable and not alone.","Professor [Removed] has been one of the best professors I've had so far. It is clear she cares about her students and the connections that she wants them to build. She gives us many opportunities to succeed, not wanting to let us fail / suffer from our mistakes. Rather, she allows us to make mistakes and grow / learn from them without fearing that we will lose points / get a lower grade. I love how she makes an effort to learn about her students and engage them in the material, as I think that helps the most with retention, as active participation in class helps information stick better. All in all, I wish I had a lot more professors like Professor [Removed], although I believe she is more capable to connect with her students than other professors due to the smaller size of her class.","I appreciate the study resources provided.","the class is very quickly paced and i feel the structure could be slowed down for student success.","I like how nice he is. It makes the class less intimidating and have a more positive vibe.","I wished there was like a concept check that we could do on our own outside of class after the lectures.","No, I think he is a good instructor.","She's a great teacher!","I think the true / false question are a really good test of knowledge. I have never had true / false questions on a test, so they were a surprise for me at first. However, they really force you to conceptually understand what you are working with as opposed to just numbers into equations.","I overall enjoy the class. It requires a good amount of work, but if you pay attention and study, you will succeed. The professor wants you to do well.","Dr [Removed] is an okay professor, I feel like the course is more self paced. There is little interaction or enthusiasm during lecture and very little encouragement of discussing the content with other students. Compared to other classes, like my [Removed] [Removed] class, I am more excited to learn because the content is taught in an engaging and important way. Most of the time the information presented in class is just read off slides and I could do that on my own.","I like how the professor is very encouraging and focused on improving ourselves. She has made it clear she is open to helping us find better ways to learn.","Nothing. She is just an amazing professor.","I really appreciate this teaching team!","I really enjoy Dr. [Removed]' classes. Her classes are one of the few that I feel like I actually learned from because she uses active learning and she provides us with the proper materials to study for exams. I can tell by the way she teaches that she is passionate about helping others learn and sharing knowledge. Even if her classes make you put in a little more effort than others, I think the output of the course is much greater than most.","She cares about her students and makes an effort to reach out if she sees that we are struggling in the class. I did poorly on my first exam and she reached out to offer support and encourage me to attend office hours so she can help me get on track for the next exam.","Dr. [Removed] is awesome","You do a great job of explaining the concepts through the practice problems but we do need to do more of the difficult questions during lecture time as a class, because it is hard to process information and set up a difficult question type for the first time. But once we have the information and see the thought process it gets easier to apply on our own. \n","We have done readings and had assignments about experts in this course, the instructor just never went into detail about any of these people.","I wish he would emphasize more in depth what we should review from the slides","The chemistry professors met together to discuss questions on our last exam that they felt were unclear. They gave students points back on those questions.","There is nothing I'd like to further share.","I have nothing else to share! I highly enjoy the dynamic of this class compared to most of the other STEM courses I have taken here at [Removed]!","Dr. [Removed] is very supportive and offers many benefits throughout the course to ensure that students do well in her class.","I love the instructor and the TA! They are amazing people!","I wish there was more resources other than square caps and [Removed]'s","Not that Professor [Removed] isn't clearly a nice woman, but she's aggressive about our whispering in class despite barely any sound being made, and whatever little discussion happening being about class or trying to understand content of the course because the actual lecture barely teaches us content. The majority of the time is either [Removed] saying that we're whispering, or giving us a bunch of examples but not properly explaining how to do them.","I really like that the instructor is extremely clear when clarifying any misunderstandings about a question or concept that I do not understand.","No, the instructor has been great in helping us succeed so far.","I really enjoy the class and think everything is set perfect. I do have one critique though. I believe the discussion sections - outside of taking quizzes - are kind of a waste of time at the moment. When asked about homework, from what I've noticed, not much work is done, and people mostly only show up for the quizzes or sometimes the extra credit opportunities. To benefit students, something that my [Removed] class actually does is during [Removed], we are given a handout - practice problems - that we first do as a class ( independently or in pairs ) and then discuss as a whole - with the TA. This gives some more practice and I feel as if its better than just opening it for HW in general, as I feel like we have enough TA's and drop - in hours that going over HW during Discussion [Removed] is quite unecessary.","I really like how Professor [Removed] has organized this course. Since the exams are not high stakes, I feel less pressure to be perfect and am able to focus on understanding the material and appreciating it.","I think by allowing us to share about our week ( through [Removed] / crappies ) and then rewarding us for sharing, the professors have encouraged honesty and transparency amongst students. This is really important and I encourage that other professors use a similar approach to work around students being nervous or anxious to share about themselves.","I liked that the instructor is relatable and mentions mental health as being an important aspect of learning","He is genuinely very nice and funny. His lectures are kept short and packed with information. His exams so far have been pretty fair and the grading scheme is very good.","The instructor seems to have a very positive attitude about the coursework and a students' ability to succeed within the course. I believe that this is very important for students as it allows them to have the confidence they need to succeed, especially when just starting college.","Being in Professor [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] course, I have found that we are not able to learn from our mistakes, instead I feel as though I must know the material perfectly. I feel as though I am not growing as a student who is able to understand statistics.","I think the instructors should offer points back on the quizzes, or cut down the amount of questions. There are many questions, a large portion of which are memorization based. For the first quiz, we were asked about the number of related deaths / illnesses in 2019. I do not understand the point of asking such a question. 2019 is not the most recent year, so why 2019 specfiically? Additionally, what is the point of memorizing such a fact? will this be usable in our future career knowledge? How often do adults discuss this on a daily basis? I feel that memorization questions are unfair. Asking more practical questions makes sense, such as [Removed] procedures, or the proper methods in subculturing plates, etc. These are questions that we will apply in the lab. The quizzes are very frustrating, and add a stress factor from the extremely large bank. Additionally, last year's class did not have to take quizzes. There is also no opportunity to earn points back. To improve, I think you should eliminate the quizzes like last year, reduce the number of questions, give the chance to earn points back, or allow the option of collaborating such as group quizzes. In other labs, you work with peers and fellow researchers to accomplish a goal, this should not be too different. The quiz aspect of this class should have improvement","his lectures are informative but not super helpful for learning the material and making it stick but he does have a lot of questions to practice from","Our lab TA speaks in term that are easy to understand and does not use strange scientific jargon when giving us directions. [Removed] also tries to interact with each student individually so we feel comfortable in the lab.","I love professor [Removed], she is so lively and personable. Even though the concepts we cover in class are relatively simple she makes it fun and keeps us involved and entertained, which I love about the class and this instructor.","She's the best!","[Removed] makes us feel included and treats us like we are nothing below her.","She is encouraging and ensures that we know she truly cares for our success.","Very supportive made me feel good about this class","She is great. Very smart and a great explainer, provides us with the materials we need to do well and is a very kind and genuine lady.","I really like how the professor reinforces our learning by referring back to previous material and making us practice it in new circumstances. Usually, she quickly goes over topics and then we see them in practice through the worksheet, lab, and homework. Although this can be a lot of work, I think it really helps me learn. I feel encouraged when I get to have multiple attempts to learn the material. Also, I like it how she discusses that it's totally normal not to feel comfortable with coding and stuff. When she does this, I feel like I'm making good progress and that I'm not behind.","I wish the instructors were more active on [Removed] [Removed] I feel like I would post my homework questions there if I knew it would get responded to in a couple hours, but I understand Dr. [Removed] and the TAs have other classes, research, and personal lives and can't constantly tend to [Removed] discussion. It's just really frustrating to go approach a homework problem 4 different ways and it still be wrong and not know what to do.","Dr. [Removed] is a phenomenal professor and he is the standard I hope to see in future classes. He is genuinely invested in teaching and understanding these concepts out of [Removed] it's clear he doesn't view it a boring responsibility. His lectures are easy to follow and concise. I don't feel shy about asking for clarifications when I need it and I do feel like I learn [Removed] [Removed] at a fundamental level. His grading is completely fair and the workload is pretty good. I believe he doesn't feel the need to drown us in work to prove that we are learning, the [Removed] are enough. Simply amazing professor.","In my experience I haven't learned much from going to the actual lecture, Dr. [Removed] spends more time talking about big theory's or ideas that won't be on our tests, and the stuff that we actually need to know she always says \" we will talk more about it later \" and we do its just we talk about it like 3 classes later, but in order to do our homework's and do well on the quizzes you need to know the information. So I spend most of my time teaching the topics to myself. I will say she has great resources for outside of class, there are at least 3 separate office hours each day, and lots of extra practice and review that we can do. At the beginning of the school year I would get super worried after I left the lecture and understood nothing, now I just accept it and realize I have to learn most of the material myself.","She is a great professor and   teaches in the best way possible","[Removed] Test Review Session","Even though I overlooked the focus on learning objectives at first, when it came time to studying for the test, this was a very useful criteria to look for in my exam preparation and helped me adequately realize what concepts I needed to spend more time with.","The instructor rarely shares about he rpersonal life or career which could help us feel closer to them and navigate our own career decisions","There is not much to say other than he is a doing a good job and helping students in the course.","Your lectures are fantastic but so quick! I envy the way we can fit so much information in such little time ; however, at first this was a difficult adjustment. I can say that a lot of this is learning on our own, but if people listen to lectures and are willing to ask questions, it's greatly helpful. I appreciate you for answering all our questions and giving little tidbits of information to us!","I think that Professor [Removed] does a great job of trying to help students truly understand the topics covered in this class without emphasizing studying to the exam. In my opinion, I think that the course would be a little better is Professor [Removed] went a little slower and tried to simplify the content to help us grasp it better.","I like that the instructor goes through why certain answers are right or wrong instead of just naming the right and wrong answers and moving on.","Allow the TAs to walk around the class and answer questions. Post specific question types and have in depth review sheets.","Sometimes I feel unprepared to complete the assignments. I attend [Removed] and every class period where I take thorough notes and ask questions but I felt unprepared to do the third homework. I enjoy how class consists of a lot of examples but I felt unprepared for the kind of questions being asked which made me question if I'm missing something. I have a learning disability so sometimes it can be challenging for me to connect dots that are very subtlety placed and I usually need things to be laid out for me to understand them. Especially in a class like physics where I have no experience whatsoever. Overall, I would like to see questions similar to what we are going to be tested on during lecture so I feel more prepared to properly demonstrate what I am learning in class.","The instructor is helpful but the course itself is just very difficult. I wish there were more varying office hour times.","I really enjoy how the professor will come up to us while we are working on our class activities to ask us how we are doing not only with the material but in life in general.","Extra help sessions and support for those confused on class","Recently, class has been interrupted because of the professor telling people to stop whispering but in all honesty, I never hear any whispering. Most of the background sounds in the lecture hall are made up of coughs and creaks not whispering in my opinion. The constant stopping of class to address this issue that most students don't notice distracts me and causes me to lose focus.","Dr [Removed] is super nice and sweet as a professor but his course is super challenging","She is an amazing instructor who keeps students involved and makes learning fun. She encourages students to give it their all and always ask questions if needed. She has no problem going back to review or repeat information and provides an enormous amount of support to ensure that all students feel comfortable in the course.","She makes me feel hopeless. Genuinely like I have no chance in the class no matter how much I study or try.","Not anything specific","I do remember her throughout last week, explain that there are different accommodations for rigorous classes that we have available to us, for example, chemistry. I also remember that she mentioned the different out of class resources available to us as tutoring.","My instructor has been very good for the most part. While we are moving fast, it is manageable. I wish at the start she honed in more on what we should be doing to study for tests and give a rundown of what to expect for each unit.","It is my opinion that Dr. [Removed] has spent too much time trying to shush students in class when they are speaking while they are not supposed to be. I agree with her in that their whispering and sometimes complete just talking is distracting, but I also think that as a professor she should of all people be able to tune it out to focus on the lesson. She has said that my class ( 11 - 12:15 ) has missed out on multiple insights for the tests that the other 2 classes have recieved because she spends so much time having to stop and ask people to quiet down. I can appreciate the first couple of times, but she has easily made the comment 10 + times a lecture and I find myself frustrated not only with the people talking, but her for bringing it up so often instead of going through the lecture. I am fully aware that talking is incredibly disrespectful to her and the rest of the students, but I'd like to say again that in my opinion she needs to spend less time focusing so much on it to just continue teaching so that the rest of us can learn as best as possible.","I love the fact that he offers corrections on exams, because especially in a class like physics, you need practice to truly understand what you're doing. And I think having the incentive of doing corrections [Removed] encourages learning of the material. This is my second time taking the course and my experience with this professor has been 10 times better, I actually feel like he cares about us understanding the material.","The professor cares about the students feelings not just teaching. I like the professor.","I HATE 30 [Removed]. [Removed] [Removed], at least give us the whole lab time to do them, so i don't have to stress about running out of time, and actually focus on the concepts rather than the time.","The practice exam for midterm 1 was easier than the exam. I would like a practice exam of the same difficulty as the exam.","Not really, [ retty standard teaching stile. Is very engaging and supportive.","I LIKE HER WAY OF TEACHING","Dr. [Removed] is extremely caring, empathetic, and I have no doubt that she genuinely cares about the lives and learning of her students. In our discussion section, she gets us snacks in the morning, easily making our days.","I really like how Dr. [Removed] has different options for the last 5 % of our grade. We can choose to either go to Discussion [Removed], watch and answer questions for [Removed] videos, or do the [Removed] reading assignments. This is very helpful because although I chose the Discussion [Removed] option, I also like to watch the [Removed] videos occasionally when I want to strengthen my understanding on the concept.","I really liked the study guide and practice exams she offered to everyone for studying. I wish there were more questions on the practice exams to study. I don't much like the group projects. They seem a little out of the scope of the class in terms of data organizing and stuff like that. I feel like it's a little harder to do, but that just may be something she is doing to expose us to it. Also, she seems really kind which makes me want to listen and learn in her lectures more.","She's awesome. No complaints and she's very understanding.","Not really, this class is pretty standard and doesn't require much involvement from diverse perspectives or whatnot, since its an analytics course. There are only so many ways different perspectives can perceive data.","Her overall teaching methods make me feel as if she truly cares about her students success","I feel that the instructor has definitely made my experience to the class pretty good as I feel like they care.","Not at the moment","He has been a good instructor, and I really enjoy this course!","Love being able to discuss class content with my peers as this gives me an opportunity to learn from others","The instructor is really kind. I just feel like I'd leave lectures feeling confident about the material and then see the homework and be completely confused.","She moves on too quickly sometimes especially on harder topics, which I understand having to move on to get work done but we don't even get to learn. I'm not the only one, I've literally sat next to people I don't know and they say the same things.","It's not exactly an issue because we don't have exams in the course.","I think sometimes she's just reading off of the slides and marking things that aren't necessary. Before our test, she had two lectures where she mainly went over electron configuration, which I personally do not find to be that difficult of a topic, and felt as though the time could be allotted to things much more difficult.","I really like Dr. [Removed]. She honestly makes learning chemistry enjoyable for me, she goes fast but not to the point where you get lost if you looked through the material before class. She is patient and kind, and I'm thinking of becoming a [Removed] because of her class.","Dr. [Removed] tries his best to explain a complicated concept to students","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor. She teaches the material well and cares for her students. If there is anything in this survey that I indicated she has not discussed or done, it is because this course is an introductory biology course and those topics simply do not come up.","i love learning from [Removed] [Removed]. She is so friendly and so very easy to understand. She is also very encouraging.","My professor does not take questions from students.","Dr. [Removed] is very sweet and knowledgeable, but I often feel intimidated to ask basic questions about some biology concepts. Even her office hours make me nervous. I think offering a discussion section where students refresh on basic biology would be helpful.","The instructor is very good and teaches the material very well.","I would like [Removed] to utilize lecture time as learning time, not review time over content in homework.","I don't feel like the lectures are very helpful.","He is very kind and approachable","I appreciate the instructor's ability to balance lectures and student collaboration into class. I also think that the lectures are engaging.","She has be the only professor I have had so far that acknowledges the mental struggles that students in stem majors face. Telling us constanly that it is ok to cry, and to feel like you aren't good enough, and to have imposter syndrome. she tells us that we are not alone and that these feelings are common, but she also motivates us with her success stories as a female physist.","Not much. Dr. [Removed] is a solid professor.","There was one time when I was particularly late to class ( which is still something I am working to ameliorate ), and so I had missed the [Removed] question for the day. Dr. [Removed] was very understanding and reopened the [Removed] so I could receive credit for that day. It really hit home that she is an understanding and supportive person, not that it wasn't already pretty clear by then. She always takes the time to answer student's questions and really makes an effort to interact with the students whenever possible, as well.","He is so personable, and I really enjoy his class. My TA, [Removed], is incredibly helpful. She is AMAZING at her job, and I credit her with helping me get comfortable with college level biology.","Dr. [Removed] often encourages students to ask questions when they are not understanding the topic. However, sometimes the way she responds is simply restating the question / doesn't provide more details / implies that the student should have already know it.","No, I really like her though. She is very welcoming and very fair. I like her method of [Removed].","I just believe that for a difficult class, she tries her best to make students actually learn and essentially relieve their stress. Her grading policies are nice as well as her study sessions.","The pre lessons that she posts make it way easier to understand the in class lectures.","For me I think the fact that the professor is open to students making mistakes and helping us overcome those struggles has been refreshing. He is very helpful in office hours","He likes the moon a lot. That has nothing to do with this, but I also like the moon a lot and its nice to know other people actually study and really enjoy the moon as well. I hope you're having a great day, if not go look at the moon. \n\n BUT TELL [Removed] TO BREAK DOWN HIS SIMPLIFICATIONS BECAUSE SOMETIMES HE JUST SIMPLIFIES EQUATIONS WITHOUT EXPLAINING HOW HE GOT [Removed] - TELL [Removed] \" WRITE OUT ALL THE [Removed] YOU DO FOR EVERYTHING EVEN IF ITS OBVIOUS \"","The instructor did a great job at teaching chem and being helpful.","He's a great teacher who does not strictly think in physics in order to foster a liking and understanding of physics in students, being effective in doing so.","I think this course is great with Loveridge, but I do understand that [Removed] in general is a very rigorous topic in general ; overall I do wish that the midterms were I bit more less challenging in the terms of the content of the midterm, such as the clock problem. But overall the current system is great for those taking engineering physics.","Dr. [Removed] is very caring and understanding when it comes to mishaps with an exam, sickness, technological troubles, and any issues we may face that prevent us from learning. These actions and empathy towards situations helps to create a more fulfilling learning environment that is not constantly pressurized by the need to succeed, but rather by fostering the growth of the individual student.","She asks after every topic if everyone understands what she is saying but because there are so many people in the class, your opinion doesn't really matter but that is not the instructor's fault, more it is just because general chem is a large class always.","All instructors are supportive and encouraging","I think Dr. [Removed] does a fantastic job at presenting the material needed for class and allowing enough time for in class practice and discussion.","Nothing else, she has done a great job and I'm happy with her class.","The instructor is very nice and tries to remember students' names. She genuinely wants to bond with students.","nothing else specifically that i can think of","Dr. [Removed] can be hard to hear at some times so students usually crowd the front of the room. The slides also go fast so studying beforehand is a must. There is a lot of extra credit, however, which I appreciate.","Dr. [Removed] is very sweet and always makes me feel welcomed.","I appreciate how my instructor always has a calm voice. He doesn't seem strict, instead seems approachable. I really like how he teaches ; however, I would just like to see more practice problems in [Removed] to practice for the exam.","I wish our instructor would consider giving us weekly quizzes to elevate our knowledge on subjects and ensure we are on track as we are learning, rather than waiting on tests to see if we are full grasping all the concepts correctly. I don't think the DSWs and squarecaps are quite effective enough.","I would just say it's a typical intro. class. Nothing special but nothing bad either.","I enjoyed when they would bring us snacks / candy to eat during class as it just put me in a better mood for class that day.","It was sort of jarring to have a professor admit to getting a D in the very class he was teaching to his students. He used that as a way to tell us to just \" do better than him \", which is to say he told us to not be depressed and find better study methods. On one hand, it was sort of encouraging but at the same time it sort of comes off as \" I went through worse so you people better get your stuff together and do better \". It can come off as either encouraging or condescending.","She is very comforting and makes the class seem less daunting. I tried to take intro to chemistry last year but I did not do well on my exams so I had to drop out of that class. This time, I am definitely understanding the material and doing better on exams.","She's a really nice professor, and speaks clearly. [Removed] is a bit fast but absolutely manageable if you've viewed toe modules before class as recommended.","Dr. [Removed] takes a personal interest in each and every one of her students. She is very good about ensuring that no one is left behind and that everyone has equal opportunity to benefit from her class.","I am thankful we are encouraged to participate in class activities and instapolls to start applying about the material learned in lecture as soon as possible. This helps get a grasp on information better, or clarifies the material before trying to apply it to concepts in exams.","no there is not","I feel that the questions from this survey do not accurately portray the expectations of a head TA in a [Removed] Lab.","I think that this was not done because there is a little bit of a curve in her grading method regarding the exam ; however, she mentions that we can use our first exam ( in this case, since we barely took our first one ) as a way to assess our study strategies, which can help in the future.","Dr. [Removed] does an amazing job making sure each student understands and gets lots of practice.","During the in class activities Dr. [Removed] would go into the rows and assist students that need help, which is nice.","I personally don't like the method of having you talk to and explain your answers to the people around you.   It unfocuses me from the lecture as I'm worried about being social and friendly, and then it just turns into me explaining how I got the answer.   Basically, I never get anything out of it.   I do, however, love silent time to sit and think by myself, and work things out in my head, as well as apply things to the real world in my head in between ideas.","She is very inclusive and understanding. I love how patient and kind she is!","Everything is awesome.","I really like Dr. [Removed]! He was made for teaching [Removed].","Dr. [Removed] seems to genuinely care about students.   It does become slightly frustrating that it feels like the end of our class time is rushed because of time / classroom management.","I think the tests need to be much more lenient- there's only 12 questions and no chance for partial credit","I feel confident in my ability to succeed in the course!","Overall Dr. [Removed] is an amazing and kind professor that is invested in the success of her students. I always love when professors are like Dr. [Removed] as it gives me more motivation to work harder in their class and do better.","I like that she does the muddiest point analysis because it is really helpful that she re - teaches those harder topics on a deeper level.","I like how the lead instructor gives you optional practice so that students can choose their learning strategy.","I appreciate the professor being understanding of possible situations students are going through as well as offering numerous ways to study so that there is almost every type of option out there, ensuring everyone can study the best of their ability.","Dr. [Removed] is very nice and her attitude makes me want to attend her lectures. I was scared about this course but she has made the concepts very simple in how she describes things and I know I have her support if I ever need help with anything.","No I don't think so I enjoy the way the structure of the course is and I enjoy all the instructors that teach this course. I feel each and everyone fo them add somthing different to this course and what we learn and talk about.","They are doing a great job! I'm having a great time in lab!","I think offering office hours, having a TA / LA's and having multiple practice questions has helped make Physics easier to tackle.","My instructor is very helpful when it comes to the many curiosities a first - year college student may have.","The TA is super kind and helpful. In case of any misunderstanding, she makes sure we are aware for the next submission. The TA also gives us heads up on what we can miss or what has been done or missed in the past. She goes over her thinking process on how she grades and looks for things.","He is a very good lecturer and explains topics very well.","Dr. [Removed] is a very positive person who is great at breaking down problems to a more manageable bite. Additionally, his emphasis on an open mindset helps support students through the hard parts of the course.","not in my personal experience","I feel like he approaches physics with the mindset that anyone can learn it. I really appreciate that. I feel like it can be really easy to get discouraged if you do not get something and everyone around you does. I like that he still tries his best to push everyone.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor who I can tell wants nothing but for his students to do well in his class. With that said, I think it is vital for him to see that the topics he covers in class I feel may be vague in terms of what he wants us to know for his exams. I feel as though what we cover in lecture is only the icing on the cake, and we therefore, learn material and equations outside of class that are not spoken about in lecture at all. Especially in a [Removed] I class where much of us have never been exposed to [Removed] before, this can be frustrating and difficult.","Professor [Removed] encourages members of the class who are reluctant to answer questions to open up, giving them their chance to shine, and teaching them that her class is a safe space to ask ( or answer ) questions. Whenever this happens, and a shy or closed - off student answers a problem correctly, it's very heartwarming.","I like it went professors give opportunities for extra credit. I also like it went professors want you to learn and not punish you with a bad grade.","He gave a very comprehensive review of basic physics principals to start off the first few days of class.","Office hours are really helpful.","He is not bad at lecturing. I do wish that the slides had information on them, so that I can reference later outside of class. Sometimes he seems a little desperate for students' attention, but other than that, it's a pretty decent class.","Overall, Dr. [Removed] has done a profound job thoroughly explaining certain hard - to - comprehend subjects and has provided adequate material in order to promote the overall success of her students.","I don't have anything specific to say besides how helpful [Removed] is during lab. If you aren't sure about something you can always ask and she will clarify anything for you or give you her input.","She is just such a friendly and inspiring person and professor, I was scared to take this class but I have been doing amazing in this class and i have been LOVING physics because of her!!! I love the traditional lecture style and passionate teaching with the quiz questions to test our knowledge.","I like the fact that she modifies the slide lectures and then publishes them with her annotations, which adds to another layer when I go through notes and visually see the work to get to the answer instead of a basic question - answer format.","I feel like its a memorization course and it makes it hard to gain an understanding of content in class and even in the discussion. This was a much harder class to apply my understanding to sometimes.","does not know how to teach, scribbles on slides. 600 students confused without an idea of what s going on.","She is a great professor!","He is super funny and likeable which makes learning fun","The atmosphere is really nice and quite enjoyable to participate in. The only thing I would rather not is have attendance mandatory.","I think Dr. [Removed] did an excellent job on making us feel comfortable and positive with the material. She reminds us that it's okay to make mistakes and is always motivating us for the future.","I really enjoy when Dr. [Removed] does [Removed] and how he seems passionate about what he is teaching.","I would reccomend making the grading policy a little less harsh. The minimum grade for an A is a 94 while most other professors make it a 93.","I like the structure of the course, the expectations are clear and the exams are designed well in a way that makes it easy to do well as long as you put in the work.","My instructor has a policy this semester where instead of dropping our lowest exam score, we are instead allowed to take a retake exam ( not exactly the same as the first exam, but quite similar ) one week after the original exam, testing over the same concepts. Everyone is eligible for this retake exam.","He is very nice and obviously cares for students. I think the HWs are really hard [Removed].","Dr. [Removed] did some real life examples of the content in class that I felt gave a more intuitive approach to some of the content.","I like how he focuses on growth mindset and encourages it.","Dr [Removed] provides us with many resources to allow us to succeed. This includes review notes, practice exams, active discussion with peers, [Removed] Discussion access, weekly quizzes, and more.","Dr. [Removed] is very understanding and willing to help students who are struggling in class. Although the class can be difficult, he does not make it unnecessarily difficult on purpose and only wants to see his students learn and succeed.","The course encompasses so much. Going by the textbook, it is a chapter a week. This means that sometimes people can get left behind if they don't rapidly intake new knowledge. It feels compressed.","I liked my instructor, but I didn't pay that much to details or to everything they said. I don't remember enough to meaningfully answer some of the questions.","I really enjoyed the quiz format rather than multiple major exams. I feel that this is a lot more manageable.","Sometimes I feel that the lectures don't exactly match up with what is on the homework, as people often ask a bunch of questions that aren't related to the topic, which often leads to tangents unrelated to the content.","I think the professor is doing a great job so far and the course is going well.","Dr. [Removed] is very patient with us, and it is evident that she wants us to understand the material. It is also obvious that she enjoys what she does. Even though her class is at 8 am, she makes jokes to keep us engaged. Her office hours are great as well. She acknowledges every person and encourages them to ask questions. She also encourages us to work together during office hours. She is always validating us by saying the material can be challenging, but she provides us with the way she would approach the problems. I truly believe that Dr. [Removed] cares about her students.","I really like that you can retest 1 week after exams because it gives you the opportunity to learn more and improve. I went from a 75 to a 90 and I felt I learned the content a lot better because of the retest.","Whenever we made errors, she would always help us through it and made sure we did not feel bad. She helped to correct our errors and explained to us how we can prevent them in the future.","Not at the moment!","She is a very sweet person and you can tell she loves her job and cares for her students","Dr. [Removed] is incredibly caring and kind. She makes her students feel cared for and prioritizes learning over earning high marks on assignments. She reminds students to take care of themselves and to never be afraid of asking questions or making mistakes. I can always look forward to class because of her!","She is very nice!","I feel comfortable bringing up questions / concerns I have with her. I appreciate that it feels like a casual interaction with no judgement.","Mrs. [Removed] moves too fast and does not always go in depth about what is being taught. I often leave her lectures confused.","She is a great instructor! She is very encouraging, engaging, and supportive.","Honestly, I really like Dr. [Removed] and I would recommend anyone to take him. I came into his class with absolutely no prior knowledge and this class has so far still set me up for success. He is also extremely understanding which is so nice to have in a professor.","Dr. [Removed] is very friendly and open to discussion, which is something that I think helps the students feel comfortable in his classroom and have more of an openness to learn.","I think that this professor is great. I wish the class was 2 sets of 1.5 hour lectures rather than 3 sets of 50 min [Removed] lectures each week but that is only because I think the class goes by too fast.","She's nice but the class is going very fast","Professor [Removed] is very thoughtful and kind. She shows a passion for teaching her subject and eases into topics to make learning a smooth process. I can see she is open to taking feedback and shifts her class towards what helps her students more.","The instructor took the time to go to each lab group and learn more about us and our mindsets about the class.","Can we get more practice indicative of how the tests can be in class, and also more structured practices during discussion that doesn't seem so difficult, or has questions that build on each other to help develop a deeper understanding of the concept.","Love her, she is very nice","I think Dr. [Removed] really cares about her students and their success in her class, and I think that I would love an opportunity to take her class again.","Dr. [Removed] is a caring and thorough teacher. Even though, she rushed a little to complete the material prior to the exam, the [Removed] Discussion, review notes, and practice exams are great study resources and reflect what to expect on the exam. Her slides in class are also great!","nope. He is doing great","Performed experiments in the beginning of the course helped me and other students pay attention to the topic at hand.","Despite the multiple “ No ”'s to the previous questions, his lectures are still engaging. He does go a bit fast in order to cover enough material to complete homework. However, he is a much easier professor compared to my last semester.","The instructor is good at teaching just talks too fast and doesn't provide as much detail in lectures. Lectures like already know the concept.","I have not heard it said during class, but I am sure he does","The instructor is fine. I wish she would kick people out of the class that whispered though, cause that's a real problem.","While working on handouts both the professor and teaching assistant will go around the class to help out one on one with things we are having difficulty with.","I think the instructor could do a better job explaining the topic a little bit more. I feel like sometimes, she gives us the answer but doesn't explain how she got there. Other than that, she is a great professor and all the extra resources are very helpful.","The class moves really fast, but the professor is really nice","No, I just think he teaches differently than my learning style","She's really nice but it condescending sometimes when people ask questions. She'll ask us if we have any questions and he first response is well did you read the textbook if you reply yes then she goes well it's really easy. Then proceeds to answer your questions. Other than that she is kind and willing to help but when you get talked to like that it makes you feel like you can't ask questions.","The entire layout of the course is incredibly helpful for someone who is barely transitioning into the rigor of college courses. The [Removed], availability of [Removed] / office hours, quizzes, review notes, etc. is a perfect way to set students up for success. Having such a thought - out and established course has definitely helped me.","By encouraging us to talk with students next to us, as a freshman who might feel awkward with the university, we have chance to make friends. Also, by discussing what the answer will be, by explaining to each other, we have chance to study deeply.","I like how she teaches structurally and the way she organizes her course page and material makes it easy to learn and absorb the information.","Dr. [Removed] had given insightful comments in class such as : \n “ See me as a coach. Not a football coach, but a [Removed]'s [Removed] coach. ” \n ( When explaining charge density ) “ It's like you're baking a cake with raisins. You wanna calculate the raisin density per unit of volume. ” \n Dr. [Removed] adjusts the closing time of each [Removed] question based on everyone's speed at the time. \n She also gave us choice to opt out from discussion sessions and lectures, which will make the HWs would be worth more.","No! I think [Removed] is super nice. I wish he did provide more materials that reflected the exams.","She is a great professor and has one a fantastic job teaching the course. Her student hours are extremely helpful whenever I needed help. Her TA, [Removed], is also a very helpful resource, especially with the weekly discussion sections.","Dr. [Removed] provides us with so many reviews, extra practice, and review sessions so that we are able to succeed in her class. I could not have asked for a better learning experience, especially for a class that I am not the most strong in.","I enjoy this course, but it is a hard course.","It would be difficult for the professor to make sure all students understood the material before moving on as this class is very large, but it does help that there are TAs ready to help you when needed.","I'd say he a great instructor overall. Very laid back and capable at creating students capable of passing this course.","He's always very enthusiastic to talk about physics and genuinely listens to people's thoughts during lecture.","Dr. [Removed] is a phenomenal instructor and really wants us to understand genetics and why things happen rather than just memorizing definitions and ratios. She loves when students ask questions which is great but I'm just an extremely shy person, so I typically don't.","I really like this course and it makes me feel like I'm contributing to something big","I really like the unit review structure and the very clear expectations of what will be on the exam. In previous STEM courses, the review guides were overwhelming and vague, often not knowing what material I should prepare. In this course, the question types allow me to organize my studying and feel confident before exams.","Dr. [Removed] is one of the most encouraging professors I've had at [Removed]. [Removed] is a challenging subject ( and one I've personally never learned before ), but she aims to make it simple and accessible to everyone in her class. She encourages making mistakes and emphasizes their importance in the learning process. Finally, she talks about her own challenges and failures in her career. As someone who has struggled academically but still wants to be successful in my field, her dedication to sharing her story has made an incredible difference in my life. I truly believe her attitude and approach to teaching is one of, if not the most, encouraging I've come across at [Removed]. Science can feel inaccessible at times and Dr. [Removed] is moving mountains in her mission to create an environment where students feel comfortable and confident in their ability to learn.","I honestly love the postivie and encouraging environment that you have created for us. It feels like a safe space to learn and also to make mistakes.","[Removed] is a great instructor because I believe he explains concepts in a manner that most people would understand.","Having discussion sessions in the evening is quite taxing in my opinion and I would prefer a discussion during the day but it seems for many physics and math related classes at this university, they are all in the evening which is fine for people who live on or near campus but as a commuter it is quite the extra effort to add to my commute at the end of the day.","Not really ; good guy, just kinda someone who goes through the material fast. But I guess that's college.","The reminders that we were capable of doing well on the test and that we knew the material were encouraging, but I wish she did not waste so much class time quieting down students since the lecture hall holds 300 students and this task was pointless.","I think opening assignments for completion sooner would make this course better. I wish that I would be able to begin my [Removed] earlier than Sunday, and my perusall assignment before Thursday. The course feels “ heavy ” by the end of the week because we have our lab photos due Friday, our research report due Friday, our perusall due Sunday, and then we must begin the [Removed] on Sunday ( or else we must do it on Monday ). It just feels like a lot in a couple of days for the course, and I would prefer to spread out the assignments by getting some done earlier in the week. Even getting the perusall out of the way earlier would be nice!","I wish we used the lecture times more productively, I feel like I am forced to learn all the content outside of class instead of actually during the lecture. Also, it's hard to understand units because we always mix content from later units and overcomplicate details that aren't necessary and it becomes confusing.","She's amazing in my opinion. I love how calm her voice is and how she will practice problems with us during the lecture.","Love professor [Removed], she teaches very well and gives a nice vibe to the class, would likely consider being an LA / TA for her as I feel she teaches very well and is very lenient in coursework","She is very sweet and I can't wait to learn more!","No I love the TA we have, ryan, he is very informative and allows better understanding on certain concepts when needed or simply just ask him. The area feels very open and not hostile to anything.","She is always positive during class and you are able to tell she enjoys what she does which gives a positive learning environment.","I really like the way the course is currently designed with the [Removed] Types for each unit, it helps me prioritize what I need to understand and the topics I need to study further.","I like that [Removed] was able to introduce himself which allowed us to be more comfortable asking question and so that we are not hesitant to do so. I appreciate how both instructors set this course up as it is very engaging to me.","I like the overall structure of the course, having the same format of assignments, but building upon them every week in preparation of our final research poster presentation!","I think he teaches very well, slowly, in an understanding and empathetic way. He does not shame any \" stupid \" questions, or when students get answers incorrect. In class we do a couple practice problems and then have more practice problems to do for homework. Some questions on the homework however, are difficult, so I wish that he could review those more in class or in a video recording instead of just during office hours since many of us can not make it to those timings. I also wish he could provide us with more practice problems besides the homeworks and exam reviews. On quest we can do more problems just with different numbers, but I would like wholly different problems so I can set up the questions in different ways.","I appreciate that when students argued for their point about a test question he listened and understood them and then removed that test question. This made the students feel like they are listened to.","Sometimes I'm not sure what exactly I'm meant to learn in the class. Our instructor sets up learning modules, which she says are only meant to pique interest for the lecture, yet I learn more material from these than from the lecture. In these learning modules, there also are many links to outside sources, and it is unclear how far I should dive into each topic ( what is necessary, what is optional ).","She is very friendly and makes understanding difficult concepts a bit easier.","She is welcoming to us in the sense she encourages us to talk to her about any issues with the class during her office hours and provides coffee and cookies.","I would just like to say that the way he holds his lectures into questions is good and effective to me at least as it helps me utilize what I learned. This helps me remember it better for exams.","Mrs. Hall recommended that we look at a [Removed] extension that would help with deadlines and reminders which speaks to what she has learned from having a daughter in college.","I think that is simply my professor's teaching style, and I have nothing against it. If time allows, I think he could squeeze in a few minute - long discussions to have with peers about our lecture so we can learn the material from a different perspective.","I would prefer if Dr. [Removed] worked on some difficult questions with numbers in class rather than mainly conceptual problems. Practicing with harder questions would make the homework a bit easier as well as exams. Using numbers as well will allow us to practice what an actual physics problem is like.","I think this professor is very understanding of students work load and personal matters and does the best for us to understand the topic at hand.","Dr. [Removed] also tries to learn faces and names and really intract with her students as much as she can. She is very helpful in office hours and incredibly dedicated to what she does, which I appreciate a lot. Dr. [Removed] is approachable as well, and if I had circumstances that hurt my performance in the class or I needed additional help, I would be more than willing to speak with her.","She's very nice and very approachable which is important for a professor. She's extremely willing to help and support her students, which not all professors display","She is very set on students understanding the material before we move on, which is helpful.","No, so far, the instructor is doing quite well in getting the material across and it's helpful","I really like the real - world examples and how he lectures but I think it would be nice to learn a little bit more about our instructor.","She is very friendly, and always smiling which makes you look forward to coming to the next class meeting.","she constantly tells us its [Removed] to not be good at physics right now and that its OK to feel not good enough and that we can all improve she js a girl boss","She's really nice and comforting.","She is very good at answering any inquiries and she is very good at explaining the topic in advanced but easy - to - understand terminology ( since she explains it ).","The chosen questions for our quiz were very difficult compared to the other lab sections. I think that there should be a fair set of questions for each lab with equal difficulty for each.","Dr. [Removed] is really helpful with office hours and making sure students get the help we may need.","He is very understanding and smart.","The showing of images before every lecture whether it is a recent discovery or part of his own research is such a small detail that makes every lecture better. Takes some stress off and helps us realize that we're all important to achieving evolution as a species and that anyone can do it.","I would love to be able to have an opportunity for test corrections. While it would help my grade, it would also allow me to learn from my mistakes rather than just moving to the next unit.","As a student who has difficulty concentrating on reading textbooks for long period of time due to [Removed], I really appreciate the diverse amount of resources that Professor [Removed] and her TAs put out such as the handouts and lecture slides. One slight change I might recommend is to have more visual resources such as helpful videos or diagrams that show how each concept relate to each other, but this is a minor concern since there are still many resources available for visual / auditory learners such as CSS and discussions. I also really appreciate the practice quizzes that Professor [Removed] puts out, since it helps me feel prepared for the quiz and motivated in the course, which is a big help for my perfectionism and anxiety over academia, especially since I have previously failed a biology course due to this.","This course is really fun and you get to develop laboratory skills, which are beneficial in the future for those interested in the medical industry.","Overall, I think this course is accessible and informative. Dr. [Removed] is quite approachable and offers many resources and non - required opportunities for students to improve their understanding of physics. She acknowledges the many difficulties that students face in their studies while encouraging them in overcoming them and offering strategies therein.","The course lectures are very fast and much of the class is left confused or unclear because the rate is faster than people can formulate questions or understand what they don't understand to the degree of being able to articulate a question. This leaves many people needing outside help and committing additional time and energy to learn from things that were not clear in lecture and there was no time to ask about because the professor moves too quickly usually from material subjects. Not everytime but certainly often enough to leave many confused.","They don't immediately test after they finish a unit's material ; they wait about a week, making it much easier to study and score well on the next test.","She's been a great professor who cares a lot about her students' progress.","Caudill mainly refers to pre - medical students while trying to encourage people. There isn't much diversity in the careers she emphasizes.","There is nothing in particular that the instructor has done to make me feel this way. The class isn't a class where we celebrate our accomplishments, more so move foward and see how we can improve.","focused on just class material which is good","I love Dr. [Removed] as a professor! This is my second time having her and I chose this class because I saw she was teaching it! So likable and wants the best for her students.","I think that [Removed] and [Removed] are both very good course instructors for this lab. They make the course fun, but they're both also very smart and organized, making nothing confusing and clearing up all misconceptions when they are asked. They're friendly people are good at their jobs, and this is my favorite lab course in [Removed] so far.","He a great professor.","My instructor doesn't share personal information about herself, or talk overtly about her career, which is a good thing because it keeps the class focused on the course material. It can be easy for instructors to get carried away on side tangents, so I prefer that instructors only talk about the coursework. For this course, there is a lot of information to cover and any time that would be allocated to personal information shared ( either by instructor or by students ) I feel would be better time spent going over coursework.","I like the assignments Dr. [Removed] gives us in class. I find them very helpful to make sure that I understand the material and see what I have to study later.","Dr sata is super excited about the work that he has done but I don't love how we start a new chapter before the exam on the last unit has been done","Sometimes I feel a little overwhelmed by the amount of stuff we have to know and I have been struggling a little bit.","I really enjoy that the professor breaks down the formulas we use and how to apply them.","In my opinion, the quizzes with the [Removed] bank of questions are unnecessarily stressful... but that's my only concern!","She is a great professor, I don't blame her for anything she does because it is a lecture hall with 400 students, it's impossible to please everybody.","She has been very accommodating and supportive for those who have issues or situations to overcome. This has helped me learn better as I had many obstacles to overcome this semester so far. She is also very communicative.","Well, it's a class of nearly 100 + people from the looks of it in a lecture hall, with only an hour and a half of class time, with only 2 days of actually visiting. It should not be the fault of the instructor who has done their job well of educating who they need to, but if the university is looking for a more \" inclusive and positive \" experience, it requires actually giving physical closeness and opportunities where learning one another's names at all is a possibility. I'm sure it's not convenient, but as the greatest university in the country, if you * want * to make the experience to fit that criteria, you either commit, or work to improve the system we currently have.","She is very approachable and goes over things we are unable to understand","It frustrates me that the slides in the lecture materials are not the same slides you show during the lecture- I know it is not all that important but I would like every piece of information I can get.","Although the shear amount of homework can seem intense, I think that the professor is doing a good job to make a notoriously difficult class quite friendly.","I would love to highlight that she truly cares about her students and takes extra time to ensure that everyone understands the material. She goes above and beyond by offering additional support outside of class hours, being approachable and patient, and making sure no one feels left behind. Her dedication is inspiring, and it makes a big difference in creating a positive learning environment.","Although some students greatly appreciated that she and other chem professors granted points back to students that missed arguably \" unfair questions \", I think that doing this puts students that went the extra mile at a disadvantage/ doesn't reward them for their efforts. I believe that all of the questions that received \" a regrade \" on my exam were fair and I was able to get them correct because of the information provided to me in the learning modules and exam preparation resources. While some of my fellow classmates received up to 16 points back on their assessments, I received nothing. Me and other students gain no compensation for getting a question right the first time around, and I think there should be a system for students that did not receive regrade points back to be able to receive some sort of credit back.","When the class begins I feel we are there to learn, as in listening to her talk about the material, and that's it. When she hears any kind of whispering she says come on guys let's come back I don't have the energy for this or my throat is not up for the whispering guys. Most of the time when she says this I can't hear the whispers she is referring to and it kind of makes me feel like we can't talk about anything at all or she will get mad.","No. I need to study more and go to office hours","She is greattttttt!!","He uses many visuals and graphic aids to help students visualize physics concepts.","I appreciate Professor [Removed]'s willingness to be forgiving on our tests, go slow during lessons, and to provide us with as much help as she can!","I think my instructor is doing her best to make sure there is a direct and clear path to success within her class. While it does require extra work, she provides us with the resources for success. The only thing I dislike is that certain class materials, like the learning modules, are not always provided with enough advance but are necessary for an understanding of the material within in - class learning. I also believe that the communication on when it is most useful to complete these by should be more clear. Sometimes it states they should be done by a certain time on the assignment but the due date is set to a later time and I believe this makes some confusion.","He seems nice I don't   feel very connected to him or the course because i haven't   been given that opportunity   but he definitely   does put a lot of effort given the large class size.","I appreciate how approachable the instructor is and how he takes each inquiry into deep consideration. He doesn't ever make students feel stupid for asking questions, even if they may be simple.","I feel that I am not benefitting much from his lectures and am having to teach myself the material. Dr. [Removed] gives us great information, but sometimes it is hard to understand it and comprehend topics we need to know for the unit. He is very sweet and considerate.","Overall, Dr. [Removed] provides many useful resources from undergrad research opportunities, practice problems, office hours, online unit reviews from TAs, and even external resources beyond class material for more curious students.","This class is very well structured.","I like how he is super open to questions and how he uses visual experiments to give real world examples of physics ideas.","I have found his class to be one of the most enjoyable classes I attend. I really have liked him as a teacher so far.","I think more guidance in taking notes in this class, and more structure on what is required to know and what is not required, that distinction will save a lot of students time and energy.","As a member of the dyslexic community vocationally I can not understand a word he is saying","It seems like she genuinely cares about her students and wants them to do well.","No information at the moment.","I feel like Dr. [Removed] could better explain many of the concepts he goes over in class in further detail, especially for students without prior experience in biology. He could also try to specify important concepts we need to know for success int he course without knowledge dumping on the entire class.","I really like her and the layout of the class. I wish we had more practice problems during class","He is very welcoming and open to asking questions.","One difficulty with this course is that some of the information we need for the homework isn't given until Friday, which only leaves one day to actually do those problems on the homework.","She goes through material well and does not rush through anything.","She is great and teaches very well!","I liked how engaging the professor tries to make her class!","I have already taken this class in high school and now taking it with a better professor has made the class so much easier and I understand the information now.","During the class, we had a few different professors because of some personal problems for the professors. [Removed] was always helpful under the circumstances and asked any questions we had.","Dr. [Removed] also consistently uses physical models to demonstrate the concepts we are about to learn in class, or the concept we just learned depending on if the model comes before or after learning the concepts.","I really like my professor Dr. [Removed] and I think he is amazing! I came into this class with no recent biology background ( I last learned biology during [Removed] ) so I was very nervous I wouldn't understand or do well. However, he is such a great professor that I don't feel behind the other kids and he explains the material in a way that helps me understand which I really like. Overall I like this class and I think Dr. [Removed] is a great professor and I would 100 % recommend him to other students. Also, I had a [Removed] this semester named [Removed] and she is fantastic!! She helped me fill in any gaps of knowledge I was missing and found great ways for me to remember the content of it was something I was struggling with. She is very patient and kind and I'm so grateful to have her as my [Removed]. I definitely recommend her for other students because so is so helpful and amazing!!","I like that she lets us do examples ourself before she does it, it helps me realize what I don't understand.","no I think she is great","She is truly the best.","The instructor has many good components of the course, however more practice problems or homework may help students be better prepared for the exams.","Maybe focusing only on the material that'll be on the next exam rather than going more in depth on details that won't be asked.","The class is filled with material, making it difficult for us to talk about personal experiences while also covering everything that we need to know. I appreciate the variety of examples that Dr. [Removed] uses in his lectures and textbook. The class definitely focuses on the science of biology, not as much the history or humanities behind it.","I think due to the volume of information, not all topics can be covered in extreme depth. I think that while it's a bit unsatisfying, it's also a very astute choice because there is a schedule to adhere to and a curriculum to cover, so not all thing an be fully covered in depth because those individual concepts could take a whole other course to explain.","I really like this class. I think the professor is great. I do know that sometimes the energy in the class is low because the class is at 9:30 am and a lot of kids are tired. I do like how the professor still tires to interact with the class and keep the energy levels up despite the circumstances.","No just please better explanation and more explanation on conceptual questions on the test","Professor [Removed] really makes the class feel like safe space and it is so calming and helpful.","I do not like how our instructor is inconsistent with the amount of time spent on each slide. It feels like the material is being rushed toward the end of class.","No, just that sometimes it is hard to follow his though process when he is lecturing and the squarecaps being for accuracy feels unfair because this is our first time seeing the material and we should be having to be able to apply the knowledge already cause we haven't even been given time to absorb the information.","Nothing else to share.","He is very nice and open to people asking him questions.","I like the speed at which Dr. [Removed] teaches and I appreciate that he makes us check in with our neighbors to ensure we're all grasping the topics.","I really enjoy the flipped classroom style because I feel like when I do the homework before class I come into class knowing more and the concepts click better for me.","My instructors have been incredibly patient with my adaptation to university life. This includes the acceptance of my late work and being easy to contact in case I need to submit something later.","I really like her :) I think she's really great and I love having all the study resources","She's absolutely brutal when someone gets the question wrong that she asked. This girl answered it wrong and she was like' no, that's completely incorrect. \" Everybody I've talked to about it is like I'm never answering a question from her ever again because she was blunt as hell about it [Removed].","I think she has done very well with trying to understand where the students are. She has also done well with explaining everything when someone is confused.","No, I have no other info to provide","Really nice teacher! It isn't a class for opinions so I felt weird answering questions about like opinionated subjects as this is a biology class.","I don't really like her lecture style(as do many other students I have talked with ) so I struggle to focus during class. I end up learning a lot of the material on my own time.","I do wish, though, that she would not condemn whispering as much in her class. I understand that sometimes it can be annoying, but there have been times that I did not understand parts of the material, and I asked either a peer or even a TA to explain it to me. Both times, the professor asked the peer and TA to keep quiet and for students with questions to write them down. While I understand her viewpoint and frustration, if I am confused with one part of the lecture, as she attempts to build off of it, I won't understand the rest of the material as I didn't understand the concepts she is attempting to build off of. I think she is a nice person, though. I just wish she'd be a little more forgiving of whispers related to the concepts, at the very least if it is between a student and one of the TAs.","Great professor","This is my first time taking physics. I have never taking physics in highschool prior to this semester. This course is difficult but I believe the support that Dr. [Removed] provides is crucial for a student who found this course challenging like me. She make my experience with this course feel much better and I hope I can improve my learning and understanding of physics after the course finished.","Posting learning modules the night before a lecture is a bit stressful, as it does not give me enough time to complete material that is significant to understanding the lecture the next day","She is doing a great job at teaching physics, I can understand the concepts that I am supposed to learn from the way she lectures. I myself am unsure how some of the questions in this survey can be relevant or implemented into a physics class, but I tried to answer the questions to the best of my ability.","The instructor often spends a lot of time on easier topics at the beginning of the lecture, with many practice questions and dicussion time among the students. However, this takes up a lot of class time and results in less time spend on more difficult topics at the end of the lecture. Oftentimes we barely cover topics in lecture before being quizzed on tested on it, and our class seems to always be behind of other professors in topics. I often have to learn topics at the end of the unit from other students to ensure I have a deep enough undertanding for the exams.","I really like how she structures the class with Instapolls and time to discuss with other students throughout the class. She's also very kind and understanding and it seems like she genuinely cares about our health and success.","I have definitely found this course to be extremely difficult, especially when it comes to applying what we've learned in class to the homework assignments and the exams. I have found that we barely scratch the surface of a topic in class, but are expected to know way more about it to answer homework questions. I think Professor [Removed] is such a kind person and truly cares about her students, but I am struggling with this aspect of the class.","I did everything in this class that I was supposed to do before the exam. I had done all the textbook readings, re - did the homework problems three times, redid the practice exam twice, went to multiple office hours sessions, and reached out to other friends in the class. I had fully felt as though I understood the class content. However, after the exam I was disappointed with my grade despite the fact that I tried my best and the questions of the exam were significantly difficult, which we had not encountered in class or in the practice before.","This is just a personal thing but I would prefer a better note system. Like how other professors handwrite them on a tablet. With just the slides, I get confused on what to write down as I don't have time to write all of it down and then I don't know what notes I need until the test.","The instructor is very thorough with his teaching methods and I have no doubt that if students are having difficulty with the class content, he is more than happy to help.","The course is extremely fast paced, it typically takes me between 48 and 96 hours to fully grasp the material. Quizzes occur on a weekly basis every Wednesday ; I had even 24 hours more to review the [Removed] before the next quiz I would understand it so much more. Because the content slides aren't posted in advance, there's no way to review early.","The instructor is very kind and understanding. The teaching style however throws me off due to how what we learn in class does not correlate to what we do in lab as there is more that we are learning in lab with the short amount of time we have to complete the assignment.","The only thing that made this class difficult was the style of the lecture which often felt slow at times and didn't always follow along with the learning modules ( sometimes would touch on material not yet administered via learning modules ). Additionally, the pacing of the lectures would lead to the professor rushing through numerous slides within the last minutes of the class, impending my ability to actually take anything away from the lecture. Apart from this it's very clear the professor wants her students to succeed and gives a multitude of resources to make this a realistic possibility, and I very much appreciate it.","I thought that the instructors were incredibly helpful when it came to making the students feel understood and engaged in class.","I love how accessible all the materials are, because I'm definitely someone who likes to go in and flesh out my notes after lectures, and Dr. [Removed] is really great about updating material according to what we've done in class. I also appreciate that the Learning Modules don't lock until the day of the test because I like being able to go back and read over the information there.","One thing that Dr. [Removed] has repeated throughout the class that has lifted my spirits was saying that physics is a challenging topic to grasp, and that it is normal to struggle with concepts. However, he has offered extra help in the form of multiple sessions of office hours per week to the students that are truly struggling.","He relies on slides too much and doesn't elaborate enough on the topics he covers","None that stand out to me","Dr. [Removed] is very much invested in the success of her students, which transfers directly to the motivation of her students and them understanding the material.","Dr. [Removed] is an excellent instructor very understanding and workable. He does tend to speed up his content, but if you keep up with the reading, than you should be overall fine.","He is a great professor and my only suggestion is expand a little deeper on the material and not just give charts and say know this material.","Not all exam questions are not very similar to the homework, there are certain concepts that are hard to understand when not related to real life. However, her specific squarecap questions keep my attention on the lectures","He is pretty chill and a bit monotone at times, but he feels dedicated to helping you learn in a laid back sort of way","I find the question types to be incredibly helpful for studying, as well as the review notes, which have so far been crucial to getting good grades on quizzes and exams.","We do plenty of practice within the lecture time, but I wish she provided more out - of - class practice materials rather than just practice exams.","I think everyone in this class loves [Removed]. She's a great instructor and our [Removed], [Removed] is very knowledgeable and nice. They make it very easy to listen to them and trust them.","he has a very strong accent so I can't understand him well","Dr. [Removed] is very nice and good at breaking down the information in an easy to understand way.","I like that her classes are one hour each because that makes it easier to keep up with content. I like the interactive nature of letting us work on problems ourselves before explaining them. I also really enjoyed the exit ticket she provided where she asked us to reflect on our goals while in college. It's nice when instructors seem to care beyond the scope of their class where our lives are headed.","Not really, but I am really enjoying this class!","I would have enjoyed going over the learning modules in lecture instead of it being self - taught","I would like more practice problems that are similar difficulty to the exam so it gives us better practice for the exam.","very kind professor. love how honest and open she is. very grateful to have such a humble professor who understands how different backgrounds can impact our previous knowledge and how there are barriers to entry in stem fields.","He goes pretty fast in class so it really helps to pre read using the textbook.","I would just say that we have access to the lecture before the lecture.","Keep up the great work!","I really love how organized this instructor is in terms of helping us prepare for exams.","I think the usage of worksheets ( R - markdown ) to work through during class provides a hands = on learning experience that helps the programming knowledge stick better ( and ensure understanding ) because students have to interact and work together / independently to figure the questions out.","I'd like her to not be playing music in class while she's actively instructing all of us, it makes it kinda hard to follow what she's saying at times.","I think that it could help to respond to more questions that students ask online ( such as in [Removed] ) during the lecture period. However, I understand that there is limited time to work with.","No, she is great instructor and I enjoy going to her discussions.","Dr. [Removed] makes it a point to learn our names and she is incredibly kind and caring. She is an amazing professor.","I appreciate his flexibility and kindness","I appreciate the amount of examples and resources provided, especially with the question types and unit review notes!","Slides and class in general feel very disorganized, it feels like we are bouncing around a lot and she also says \" we will practice this later \" like 5 times a lecture and i usually don't feel like we end up practicing said thing","I appreciate that my instructor uses a space theme in every lecture. He ties physics into real life stuff and experiences so that we can do the same.","I like how she shares small hobbies and things she's passionate about outside of work. It makes me feel special as a student.","do a good job in making sure we understand the material even though we have a big class size.","She is a very helpful professor who is always willing to help her students learn the material.","I enjoy the leaning modules alongside the retries you get as it gives you an opportunity to learn. I also like the reviews that were provided ; however, I think it would be efficient to maybe have a website that auto generates questions to make endless reviews so it's impossible to run out of resources.","I really enjoy the in - class notes. I believe it is a lot more helpful for learning physics concepts than to watch a presentation of powerpoint slides.","My instructor grades on completion / effort which means my assignment grades aren't an accurate reflection of my knowledge of the course. I believe this incentives students to check their own work against the answer key and learn from their mistakes.","I enjoy learning the biological processes on a macro level, and enjoy the videos that we watch to help.","No, nothing specific","Professor [Removed] is definitely an excellent educator, and it is clear that he is passionate about the material he teaches. My only complaint with the course is that the homework assignments often do not match the material learned in class, and more classtime could be dedicated to preparing for and understanding the homework.","She is the sweetest instructor I have ever had who genuinely cares for her students. She is amazing at teaching and there is no one else I would rather have for this class.","Dr. [Removed] is an amazing teacher for intro chem, coming into college I was nervous about taking chem after hearing the horror stories, but Dr. [Removed] has broken it down for me and has provided a great experience. She ensures all her students are engaged and that we are putting ourselves in the best position to succeed by taking advantage of our resources.","I reccomend taking more questions out of the textbook and explaining what sections would be most useful for the next lecture so students can get another chance to understand the material. Besides that, it's good to always encourage discussion and have students answer each other's question so they can flex their knowledge regarding the question or subject.","Dr. [Removed] always makes everyone feel welcome. It feels nice to have this course since I can relax after a long day of lecture and not have to worry about any pressure from Dr. [Removed] or my peers.","I filled out the survey about Professor [Removed], but I first wrote Dr. [Removed]'s name. My sincerest apologies. \n\n Also, Dr. [Removed] is the best physics professor I have had. Her words and efforts to connect with students helps motivate me to do my best."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>instructor_id<\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.course_additional<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"instructor_id","targets":1},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":2},{"name":"or.course_additional","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

This happened on a weekly basis, with words and messaging consisting during class, before class, and through canvas messaging.","Students are always placed in pairs, small groups, or split class for discussions. They have an opportunity to debrief on the readings, share their thoughts and opinions, and present experiences from their own life as it relates to the topic or reading at hand.","I'm focusing in two skills : \n 1. group work \n 2. data skills \n\n They have been working in roup and will be doing a peer evaluation later in the semester. \n They have just finished a data skill assignment and a next [Removed] is coming up in October. \n","Most days in class for my large intro course I try to highlight at least one real world aspect of the physics we are learning. Often this can be small examples of similar systems to what they're seeing in a demonstration.","I have new questions in my in - class quizzes where the students get 3 minutes to talk to eachother","While ensuring I cover all the appropriate course material, I want to include real - world examples during class. For example, in Gas Laws coming up, there are a lot of applications, such as [Removed] diving and hot air balloons. I see this tactic as one where I can tie in student interests ( like pre - health majors ), as well. I will think on how the upcoming topics can tie to medicine.","At the end of each week of lab, students are asked to interpret results from experiments and provide an explanation for the results they recorded during the week.   Here is an example question on their 11 - 8 Research Report Assignment on [Removed] : \n\n Where your results expected or unexpected?   Why?   What do these results tell you about the bacteria in your soil sample?","When lecturing, I like to plan specific questions at the start of certain topics that I pose to the class before we learn the specific formula / method for solving them.   I believe I allow them enough time to think of their own answers before moving on.","When students reach out via email and/or in - person that something has happened, preventing them from attending class, taking an in - class quiz, or showing up for an exam, I work with a main TA to help convey next available steps. We have an email template, and I provide a time between the last class and the final exam to make up class exams if University - approved documentation is received. There are also a number of in - class polling and quiz drops to help account for students' life circumstances.","In class I ask them to think how their own life reflects topics we study in ecology. \n\n E.g. [Removed] 5 : \n \" How does living in group ( with room mates ) has both costs and benefits. \" \n I.e. in behavioral ecology, we study cost and benefits of group living for animal species, and how the net benefit results in the optimum group size. \n\n E.g.

Also, many topics covered in the third unit had real - world examples and applications for both courses I teach. \n October and November \n For this project, you'll choose a genetic condition of your interest and identify a protein - coding gene associated with the condition to do some research using the 3 websites provided in the project.","Some of our ice breakers talk about professionals in STEM.    Then give the students a chance to talk with each other about their STEM identity.","As we start digging into more challenging materials, I will have more time for students to think independently on how to use code to achieve what we want to get. After some independent thinking, I will ask them to share with a partner.","All assignments were based on identities of culture and race. This was done during all classes in a way that was broadcasted as positive and asset based.","The course is framed as a class that is designed for them to succeed in their transition to college. They are told that when assignments and readings are assigned, they are designed with the goal of helping their personal growth, not for the sake of a grade. If they try their best, they will receive a full grade.","Students generally didn't do very well on Midterm 2, so I had students do a shorter ( new ) Midterm 2 a few days later for the opportunity to earn back half the points that they missed. I mentioned to students that we will do a retake instead of just curving the scores because what is important is the learning of the material, which they can demonstrate by doing another exam.","Students receive a check in every week. They can provide feedback on their weekly assignments or overall class composition.","I have several contingency policies in regard to students missing classes and homework discussed on the syllabus.

It can be difficult to assess if such a large group of students is understanding each topic, and it's usually mixed. I've stated during class, as much as felt natural, that I would love to talk to them more in my office hours.","For every prelecture topic, I ask students to provide a question or comment about it. I then use these to select examples or connections to bring up in class. I also provide my own comment or question about it, and do the same. I also occasionally have the TA or LAs contribute. I also occasionally post articles with connections in [Removed] but I don't know if anyone reads them.","I emphasize this after every midterm and often after unit quizzes.

There are statements in the syllabus, and discussion in the class, about how in previous semesters essentially all students who have made use of the provided opportunities in the class / engage fully with the class have gotten the grades they hoped for regardless of starting points or setbacks to emphasize this point. There are many opportunities in the class for students to earn missed points back by doing additional / replacement assignments.","I've added into my course a large variety of example datasets of things that hopefully are of interest to them.   When we learn a new analysis method, I tie it to answer real - world analysis questions.","I have talked about difficulties I had as an undergraduate in first - semester mechanics, and in the syllabus ( and a linked video ) I talk about difficulties I had in grad school.","Using office hours to encourage them","using real life examples based on new materials","At the beginning of the semester, I make a [Removed] math review available to students. That set of modules is optional, but it's a place where students can do a bit of practice to refresh their memory of prerequisite math concepts that will be used in this course.","In the upcoming units, I plan to show more graphs and experimental data to help the students think about the content in a different way. For example, graphs could help exemplify the relationship between pressure and volume, or volume and temperature, within the Gas Laws unit, better than merely looking at a formula.","In my courses there is a major collaborative project that is pursued through scaffolding assignments. I mention in each assignment what learning outcome the assignment will help them tackle.","I have designed [Removed] 206L so that students have a chance to learn a technique ( and make mistakes ) and then, the following week, they conduct the experiment ( and hopefully not make mistakes ).   I emphasize, whenever possible, that making mistakes is a natural part of learning, and that students are not penalized for making mistakes.   Students are given the opportunity to practice a variety of techniques such as serial dilutions, microscopy, Gram - staining, and [Removed] and gel electrophoresis before they use the techniques to examine their soil bacteria.","I will mention to students that with practice they are all capable of doing well in the course.","I ask \" what are your questions? \" and then have a long pause, frequently during class.

Choose one of the following experiments, describe the purpose and method of that experiment to a family member as your audience. Be clear and concise to help their understanding.","This semester I will be showing a few videos of people talking about how they learned from their mistakes. I also state this during class from time to time. When discussing a problem solving strategy I talk to students about how they may make mistakes when approaching a certain problem, but that is a valuable learning experience that will help them later in solving future problems.","I emphasize the course structure that includes Replacement Exams, vs. a cumulative final exam.

I don't always say this to student groups- just those students who seem frustrated when they are having issues growing their bacteria.","The second [Removed] [Removed], and the final CIS.","I do this every day","We connect students with campus resources. They are encouraged to connect with mentors so that they can ask questions about college or their related field.","I use a getting to know you activity at the beginning of the course that allows students to express their interests. They present this activity to their peers in discussion and I also get to read their responses and try to provide comments in their assignment. This semester, I have not been able to provide comments yet.","They are offered a second try at each midterm exam.   The second try occurs 2 days after the first so it is fresh in their minds. I always tell them between tries that fixing mistakes is a great way to learn.   Also, the two tries reduces test anxiety.   Everyone has bad days... Personal stories.","We continue to emphasize access to office hours and similar resources with considerable effort from the LAs to provide both office hours and study review sessions. Course extra credit is offered to encourage attendance and we will continue to emphasize these opportunities through the remainder of the course","I am planning to invite students to my music shows ( free to attend and near campus )! I know that a lot of them are playing an instrument or enjoy live music so it would be a great way for them to learn about my music. I also share posts from [Removed] for hiking ideas or win free tickets to a show.","Students were given a lot of feedback in their assignments in a way that wasn't punitive. Always in a way were they could share their ideas and feel like they can authentically share without feeling like it might impact their grade.","In my syllabus there is explicit text on how I handle missed / late work due to emergencies. I also individually check with students that have missed significant assignments. \n I usually ask them if everything is going well and that I am concerned about them.","I use [Removed] to gauge students' understanding of the material. I typically give students one or two questions per class and I show students the results ( in terms of a poll that shows the distribution of student responses ).","Students were asked to share their ideas and experiences in most classes and weekly assignments. They were asked to share verbally as small groups and then as a class.","Send another well - being message through [Removed]. \n The week of the 13th. \n Last time I mentioned the university resources like x, y, and z that can help you cope with life challenges. I want to make sure you receive the support you need and reach out to me if you need additional support from me. We will discuss options and find accommodations that can relieve your situation. Feel free to reach out to me.","I have a retake exam for every exam \n In - class quiz question provides 90 % credit for participation \n Homework assignment has one free try","Students are directed to reach out to the teaching team in a timely manner to discuss the issue. I try to work with student schedules to facilitate make - up exams whenever possible. For homeworks, I had [Removed] create a token system where any student can give themselves a 24 hour extension on assignments up to three times per semester.","For every problem I do in class, we \" check the answer \" by trying to interpret the meaning of the answer. Sometimes I do it for them, sometimes I have the class provide answers. In office hours I make every student do this for every problem.","We are about to release their first quiz grades, and I will talk to them about not comparing themselves to others in the class.   And that they can improve on the next one.","All students had the experience to work with a peer outside of class at least once for the semester.","There are many opportunities in the course : students complete lab assignments in groups that I assigned at the beginning of the semester, students work in groups to complete quick exercises during lecture, students can choose to work on a research project either independently or collaboratively.","I use real - life ( nature, medical ) examples in my in - class quizzes","always make sure to encourage them to work on the instapolls and examples together before I myself discuss","When we get a bit further on, I can use specific examples like teaching about sound using music examples.","I have suggested useful youtube modules to review math skill needed in this class","I mention how important it is for me to have them in office hours and make sure to re invite them","I do this in class when I am encouraging reticent students to participate in answering and asking questions","By comparing the difficulty level of the materials covered in different midterm exams and showing them why it is important to recongnize even a small improvement","We have talked about [Removed] learning center and [Removed].    We will start to talk about course schedules and looking at degree progress   in the next few classes.","There is graphical or numerical data in each of my lessons. \n I do emphasize the importance of these models. \n The next few week is mellow, but in week 6 - 7 by the end of the week, we will be covering models of delayed density dependence, which reqires abstract thinking. \n\n I usually explain why mathematical models are important to understand the physical world and to make prediction","Literally sending them this survey.","[Removed] [Removed] carries an Ethics Flag, so I give students many opportunities over the course of the semester to discuss controversial issues.   Many times, that leads to students sharing their personal values.   Students have these discussions using [Removed], an social learning app.   Using this app, they read assigned articles, watch videos, and then answer prompts ( which I've written ) as well as comment on the issue.","I have statements in my syllabus about reaching out to me and/or the TA if they are unable to meet a deadline or miss a quiz.   I am typically very flexible, regardless of the reason, in granting extensions or make - ups.","Tutorials, links to other sites","Over the course of the semester, students conduct research about the soil microbiome using a soil sample they collected at one of [Removed]'s field stations.   Students examine the soil bacteria they isolate from their soil sample to look for evidence of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic production.   Students calculate the percentage of isolates that are resistant to two different antibiotics and the percentage of isolates that produce antibiotics.   Students conduct other biochemical assays as well to learn more about their soil isolates. At the end of the semester, students present their results to the class using a Research Poster.   I give them instructions for making these calculations and for presenting their in a poster.","Using instapolls during the class, pausing before and after solving an example in the class, constantly encouraging them to share their questions","We are doing this by using [Removed] [Removed] during lecture. So far, I have not used instapoll in every lecture. I am planning to use it more often in future lectures.","Along with the group work in class, I recommend to students to work on homework assignments together.   Also, students must complete lab assignments in assigned groups each week.","I sometimes asked students to discuss a question or problem in pairs and other times to discuss as a team ( 5 - 7 students ). \n October and November \n Please discuss this question in pairs with your teammates. Please discuss this problem with your team before we go over it together.","We have instapoll queries in most class sessions and will continue to do so. We use this as an opportunity for students to discuss amongst themselves as well as with the LAs and myself.","Peer instruction several times each class via [Removed] questions. \n\n I said \" if you can explain it to, or learn it from, a friend or neighbor, you will understand it better. \"","We shared with students that they need to apply situations to things and topics that they may not have covered, especially at students studying different areas. We let them know this often in class through their introduction to educational topics.","Shared a belonging story about how I dropped out of law school because it wasn't a good fit for me.","LA supported peer instruction using [Removed] to capture answers.","After I showed students the results of Midterm 2, I had them think about why we do difficult things like solving complex physics problems. I thought it was important to take a moment to have students reflect ( and share with their neighbors ) a problem in the world that they would like to solve because it was personal to them. Then I had them think about the fact that many of the problems that they identified were in fact difficult problems to solve.","During the first and later lectures, I have repeated stated something like \" Some of you have better preparation in this class than others ; but everyone can succeed in this class... \".","I do this in different ways : \n\n - group assignments ( every week ) + peer feedback on group work ( coming up next week ) \n - review sessions where students collaborate on a [Removed] handout prior to exams ( week 4, 8 and 14 ) \n\n","The students did a values based activity last week in class.    I am planning to do another values based activity later in the semester.","I ensure students there are some built - in \" safety nets \" in the course. For example, they have three chances on each Learning Module, the lowest 33 % of in - class quizzes are dropped, and the use of Replacement Exams, instead of a a cumulative final exam, are used at the end of the semester. No one, single assignment needs to be a detriment to their final course grade.","About once a week, I remind students to come to office hours and try to convey what they can expect when they come.","Everyday in class I have students work with their neighbors on a handful of formative assessments that I pose to them. I specifically mention to students that they should talk to their neighbors to help each other learn the material better.","Check - in question about students music interests. \n Quiz - questions about medical application of [Removed] concepts","The course uses materials developed by the [Removed] [Removed] Program, an international effort to discover antibiotic - producing bacteria.   Students learn about the antibiotic resistance crisis and test their soil isolates for resistance to antibiotics.","During office hours I let the students and encourage them to answer each other questions","We provided resources to help students be successful beyond the classroom as this course is designed to help with the transition into higher education. Students were shared these messages on an almost weekly basis.","This course is based on attendance so we focus on the students attending class.","Students learn about the antibiotic resistance crisis and explore the soil microbiome to determine whether soil isolates are resistant to antibiotics.   Students learn about the antibiotic resistance crisis by reading articles ( both popular and scholarly ) and watching videos and then answering questions.   This occurs on a weekly basis over the course of the semester.   For example, one of the learning objectives is' Explain why the antibiotic resistance crisis is one of the biggest threats to human health.' Students then watch several videos and review information from the [Removed] and the [Removed] and then answer multiple - choice and short answer questions. \n","I use examples provided in the book. My goal is to incorporate current examples I see in social media but it has been difficult to do so this semester to have time to do so.","This is a good idea I need to think about how to do in basic physics but I will try","I am doing value based activities last week and then later in the semester.    We also have a whole class on mental health.","  When we covered population dynamics ( week 7 ) and pathogen - host interactions ( week 9 ), I emphasized how the models we cover are the basic models that are used by the [Removed] ( Center for Disease Control ) and the [Removed] Modeling Consortium and other public health institutes. Seeing that many students are pre - health, this connects directly to their careers.","Invited students to participate in survey and providing extra credit / bonus","We will be discussing how they prepared for test 1 as we move to test 2","I'm patient with Instapolls","That's what my whole course is about. They will create their own analysis and also review some analyses as case studies.","The TAs give their input to students about how they have done will in classes and what they have needed to do to change their grades.","After midterm2 when I showed the results and the class distribution I emphasized that students should be proud of themselves for how they are doing so far and encouraged them to keep the momentum going through the rest of the semester.","Instapolls, typically 2 - -7 questions per class.","my in - class quizzes","In [Removed] [Removed], students interpret data when I present certain concepts using graphs. They also interpret mathematical models when we talk about [Removed] [Removed] equilibrium equation, logistic and exponential population growth. \n I usually start the lecture mentioning that we will cover the mathematical component of the course. In addition, I try to convey to students that mathematical models are working hypothesis that use numbers instead of words to convey ideas.","Retest for each of 3 exams, my main [Removed] thing","In every class, there were a few times I asked the students to work on a problem with their neighbors.   Occasionally I'd say the best way to learn is from your friends.","For the mental health class, I will have a student guest speaker from [Removed] [Removed] to talk about their program, provide a link to a meditation video in [Removed], and show a video about gratitude featuring a Black woman.   When I talk about seeking counseling I will mention that students have different views on the value and acceptability of therapy.   For the class on establishing relationships with faculty and staff, I will talk about cultural beliefs related to faculty etiquette.   For every class, I plan to facilitate discussion questions that allow students to present their unique viewpoints and remind them that everyone views class material through the lens of their own experience and identities.","I talk about the importance of hearing people say things in different ways, because some phrasings will resonate better sith some people than others.   I also talk about the importance of being engaged and participating for learning, even if an answer offered is incorrect.   Being incorrect is a part of learning.","They just finished mdterm 1 - and there is not a whole loft of new info to discuss in discussion. \n Instead, students are gon na venture outside to observe flowers and pollinators. This is useful for a later assignment - but is also a moment to relax and enoy the benefits of nature. \n\n - this week \n - I will aonnounce it in classas a bit of a break to them / to relax and enjoy nature. \n","While at the beginning of each lecture I try to connect the physics concepts that we are going to learn to real - world applications, from time to time during the course I also mention to students that they should think about the skills that they are learning in the course and how they may be able to use those skills to solve complex problems in the world.","During the first lecture, I shared my journey to [Removed]. I share stories about myself how to decide a research direction. I encourage students to visit me during the office hours. Except for right before a midterm, not many students have come to my office hours.","Students work together the entire semester to design experiments and then analyze the data together.   They work together to create a Research Poster to present their findings to the class.","I will run a midsemester survey and I also occasionally do squarecap questions about aspects of the course.","I attended a roundtable discussion on Imposter Syndrome hosted by the [Removed] [Removed] Council and invited all students in my courses. After the event, I shared my insights with students in two courses. \n Oct 17th \n Invitation message : \" Today, the [Removed] [Removed] Council ( [Removed] ) is hosting an [Removed] Syndrome Roundtable from 4 - 5pm at [Removed] Patio. Professors in several departments throughout [Removed] will share their experiences in dealing with [Removed] Syndrome and facing self - doubt in their careers, providing an opportunity for open conversation between students and faculty over refreshments. I will be one of the speakers at the event, and I would love to see you there! If you are interested, please sign up. \"","Values writing activity before we discussed career exploration.","By using the reasults from the first [Removed] survey","Pause my lecturing with practice problems students complete in small groups that they formed at the beginning of the semester.   I do this every class day, and the students expect it because these activities are labeled \" group practice \" or I have written on the slides \" complete the following in your group... \".","I will provide a mid - semester survey to all of my students and discuss in class how I've used it in the past and what I will do when I read their responses.   I also share common themes during a following class that gives them an idea of what I gathered from their responses.   I will do this in a couple of weeks.","I will give a few examples of past students who took the same couse and who have pursued a career in data science after taking this course. Also I will mention that they can present their project to the city of [Removed] if they are putting efforts in their research, showing that they can contribute meaningfully to their local community.","As we start analyzing messy data, I will discuss different approaches to analyze the same data, addressing any decisions that may impact data ethics. It is very important to recognize our own biases.","Since last survey, there have been two new assignments where students have to chose their own topic aligned with their interest areas. \n\n They have been introduced to the two new assignments in week 9 of the semester. \n Because these are both group assignments, students were asked to brainstorm about both assignments in week 9 and record on paper their own interests, and then decide as a group, within the realm of possibilities for their assignment. \n\n The tricky part is that the assignments are aligned with learning outcomes as well, and therefore they can not just pick anything that they're interested in. \n\n [Removed] Note 2 is aligned with [Removed] related to biodiversity, so students are asked to compare biodiversity in e.g. space ( e.g. their hometowns, major cities,... ) or ime,   or within taxa that they're interested in. E.g. many biology students have an interest in pollinators or birds or reptiles etc. \n I did have to give some feedback to students hat their chosen topic did not address biodiversity. E.g. you can study biodiversity of birds, but not biodiversity of only grackles. That might have been perceived as a negative by some student groups. \n\n [Removed] Note 3 is aligned with the LOs of the course that relate to landscape ecology and conservation biology. Students were asked to pick a topic within this realm, but many suggestions were not at all within this realm. I also gave some advice and suggestions on this. Again, this might have been perceived as a negative by some student groups. \n\n","I started the class by pointing to the very beginning of my syllabus where I go into how I believe that everyone can learn physics. I repeat this message from time to time in class where I state that students can be successful with work and a bit of time.","Most assignments for this course are based on their educational experiences that have led them to this point in their lives as freshman at [Removed] [Removed]. They share their stories and the stories of their families as it relates to their education experience, while reflecting on frameworks that they received throughout this course. Ultimately, assignments focus on their personal and professional development as well as their career pathways.","By using instapoll during lectures students are able to practice the newly learned materials","I have polling questions in every class. \n I provide the correct answer and address misconceptions as they arise ( from poll histograms )","Actually, this is not related to this particular project, but a different project. \n I am using muddiest point polls every week to assess what students perceive as difficult and create a handout / study guide for those topic. It's one way in which instructors can use AI in teaching. \n\n I do this every week. Polls are open Monday - Wednesday for content from the previous week. \n I create the handout by Friday. \n I need to prompt them to review the materials and give details on what they did not understand. \n E.g. if I have spent three lectures on' competition' and they just say' competition' it's hard to know what they don't understand.","For example, today we were discussing specific forces like tension and the normal force, so to set up the discussion I showed students a video of the current record for skydiving as a way to get them to visualize forces that not only a skydiver experiences, but the forces that we experience in everyday life. During the lecture, I mentioned during two worked - out problems how doing the problem will help them figure out a real - world application in that they can calculate the forces involved when they may need to hang an object from their ceiling.","I've talked about inequities in high school background and I will do so in future","I provide re - take exams","We talk about all of the different CNS majors in this course.   Specifically during our advising courses.","Students work in small groups ( 3 - 4 students ) to design and conduct experiments.   They work together to collect a soil sample, conduct experiments, and then present their results together at the end of the semester.   Students also use [Removed] to discuss ( on an app ) ethical issues.","I try to wait several seconds after asking questions during lecture and ask for students across different areas in the classroom to participate in the question answers.","Ha, I plan to use the survey - explaining that its use us to help evaluate the practices in this course.","Working through old exam problems in class","This was done already when presenting the theory of evolution by natural selection and talking about [Removed]'s experiences as a child, college student and husband.","Readings are mostly new to students, They are always applying knowledge that they have not covered in their reflections and other assignments. This happens on a weekly basis.","Almost in every topic I find it extremely helpful to use a real life example","I have consistently shared applications to my research or other research I am aware of. The first survey indicated that some students found this to be engaging and effective so I made a point of including several specific examples over the last few weeks, specifically a superconducting bearing and [Removed] circuits used as detectors. I typically walked through the application of the class amterial to the research along with visual aids.","At the beginning of lecture, I go around the classroom and ask students how their weekend was, what their plans are for the next weekend, check in if anyone went to the game, going to [Removed], also letting them know they should embrace the cool activities [Removed] has to offer!","In my notecard assignment and in the first week, I required students to get to know each other and find things in common. I encourage / allow students to work in groups on assignments.","I have made examples in lecture more explicit and centered around answering a research question using real data.","Show a graph of the number of mutations plotted against the parent's age \n Upcoming week \n I want you to look at this graph and think silently about the prompts shown before answering. \n","in some cases when the students have a situation which is not recognized as an emergency by [Removed] I am willing to offer help / accommodation","I am doing three hings : \n 1. reading quizzes on [Removed] ( ungraded ) \n 2. polling questions in class \n 3. at the start of every week, I aks them what was the muddiest point from the previous week. I summarize theses ( with help of AI ) and provide a handout to students.","After exams, and this time in class after the second exam, gave directions to students on how to evaluate if their learning methods were effective.","I not only mention to students the times that the instructional team is available throughout the week, but I make it clear that we are there to help them learn the material and that we are happy to help them.","We use literature that focuses on experiences that they mostly may have lived. These experiences are based on real - world applications with relationship to education, an experience that they all have gone through as k-12 students and will continue to experience as college students.","I make time to remind students of services like the physics coaching tables, teaching team drop - in hours, and [Removed]. Since we just finished the first midterm, [Removed] is particularly important to bring up for assistance with studying or note taking services.","In my large lectures we discuss the value of mistakes in helping to understand the decision process that goes into problem - solving. For my pedagogy courses we touch on specific mistakes and brainstorm changes to behaviors that would mitigate these.","We discuss the process of learning, have pre - class questions that attempt to highlight growth, use growth mindset language, etc.","I do this every class, as I ask them to guide me through solving problems.","I have students turn and talk to their neighbors regularly throughout class to discuss narrow specific questions. They also engage in active learning around primarily conceptual problems 1 - 3 times per 50 minute lecture.","Continue to tell stories about failure and improvement. \n [Removed] student's video how they mastered the physics course. \n LAs in class providing feedback. \n With email after the exam motivating students to make use of the re - take exam","One of the examples that I showed students more recently during our discussion of moments of inertia is that how a single number can tell us some very important details about a planet. This was an attempt to bring in a real - world example of how we determine interior structures of planets by calculating their moments of inertia."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>practice_id<\/th>\n      <th>practice_wording<\/th>\n      <th>or.inst_priority<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"practice_id","targets":1},{"name":"practice_wording","targets":2},{"name":"or.inst_priority","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
