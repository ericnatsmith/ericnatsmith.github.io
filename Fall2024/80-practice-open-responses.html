hours that are very useful in providing clarity on the course materials.","This has been said multiple times, specifically right after the first quiz, when the professor said that if we feel the need to improve our scores and learning skills we should make sure to practice all the problems without just looking at the answer and to try handwriting notes in class to help it process in our brains better.","Dr [Removed] has his student post a pre - lecture question or comment about aspects of the course, mostly to do with the material, and a test if we had just taken one.","I know that our instructor will provide partial credit when it comes to the quizzes but I don't think there is really an opportunity to earn back credit.","Dr. [Removed] will provide us time within lectures to converse with our group mates about what we have learned concerning the topic. Through this, we discuss our own ideas concerning the material and how we are able to reflect on learning and studying strategies not just from ourselves, but from our peers.","In the course, while explaining certain concepts, the instructor will connect these concepts to how they relate in the current scientific community or things in the past scientific community that led to coming up with medicine or discoveries.","She has made sure to stop, pair, think, and share. She makes sure we can talk to each other about our thoughts on the problems and she does this every class period.","The instructor asked us to discuss problems with our neighbors and also to collaborate with them.","we did this because it's a physics class","He includes real world examples of the human body and its systems. A recent example is when he talks about digestion and the body after asking us if we ate lunch.","When a life event disrupts our coursework, our professor has clarified acceptable events. We are to reach out to her and the offices at [Removed] to make sure we have arranged accommodations to make up exams and assignments.","At the beginning of some classes, my instructor has given the class a small question about ourselves unrelated to the class to answer with the people around us.","During syllabus week, Dr. [Removed] gave us a clear structure of how the course flows. She informed us of extra credit opportunities and how we can help our grades by attending office hours / discussion sections. Overall, she gives the classroom a pretty good vibe.","Waits for some to answer","We collaborate together in groups during Try it! Segments. This helped me meet classmates and learn from each other.","This happened towards the beginning of the semester as we were advised to get our peers contact information to stay in contact throughout the semester.","She celebrated the fact that we had already made it to [Removed] 2. This was an uplifting message, and made me feel good.","I personally do not need accommodations but I have seen mentions of the instructor offering proper accommodations for those who need it during quizzes or exams.","Had us working on a pokemon data set for hw is an example","Our instructor encourages us to speak and answer questions. She wants us to ask more questions so our curiosity could have more ideas.","We have a mandatory discussion session where the TA lead students to have grouped discussions to solve some practice problems.","Give multiple examples with demos","The instructor helps us develop our microscope and pipetting skills, which are all things we are going to have to know in the future because most of us want to go into healthcare. \n","[Removed] asks questions, and then gives us a few minutes to talk to the person next to us about what we think the answer is. Sometimes the question is unable to be answered because she hasn't talked about the material yet.","Throughout every day of class, he writes handwritten notes which guides us through the material. We go through practice problems, instapolls, and concepts during every class period. Having all of this condensed helps to had guided study materials.","I know that she has discussed experts and how they are using data science and statistics in the real world. We have also talked about [Removed] and how data scientists use this to help them.","Dr. [Removed] asks during [Removed] atleast once a week, if we are understanding the content she is teaching. Based on these responses, she decided whether enough of the class has understood the content and focuses on it.","With the way this class is structured, you're likely going to be interacting with your group everyday and possibly with other lab groups. Additionally, in the beginning of the semester we were asked to collect a soil sample at [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] wildflower center outside of class hours. This was a good experience to meet my classmates not in a stuffy classroom setting and talk about less school affiliated subjects. This small experience was great and I wish more classes did this.","yes","I'm not sure if it is something that she explicitly said but it is just the vibe that she gives off in the classroom. She seems to be very welcoming towards all paths of life and very non - judgmental.","She had us talk to the people next to us about personal questions at the beginning of the semester.","During class she is always mentioning how far we've gone and how we have learned a lot. This happens after every exam.","As grades were finalized for our first test Dr. [Removed] made sure we all knew that this test did not define us. He said that we would be able to view our missed questions to better our learning and understanding of the course.","The instructors includes all students into her lectures and provides equal opportunity for everyone","Dr. [Removed] took extra time to answer students' questions in the [Removed] Discussion and Office Hours. After lectures like stoichiometry or anything we might've needed extra practice on, she told us to attend her office hours so we could get more clarity.","The professor offers many opportunities for students to provide feedback. The professor provides polls and surveys for students to fill out both during class and after class. Before releasing the poll or survey, the professor emphasizes the importance of receiving feedback and asks everyone to participate.","Provide practice exams to go ove","I don't remember","I don't specifically remember Dr. [Removed] saying something like this, however I do not think this is an important thing to talk about in a physics course.","Usually Dr. [Removed] will bring up common errors when going over the specific topic in lecture. She usually shows us the wrong way first or asks us what we think first and then shows us the correct way.","The professor was sure to tell us about where we may be able to receive extra help for chemistry. She also told us about certain chemistry study groups","[Removed] questions test us on our knowledge and Dr. [Removed] goes over it.","In the course, the instructor acknowledged historical context by discussing how past scientific discoveries were influenced by their time's social and cultural norms, which may not align with modern values. For instance, they addressed ethical concerns in historical medical research, particularly involving marginalized groups. This approach encouraged critical thinking and open discussions, helping students understand the evolution of moral standards in science while making the course content more inclusive and socially aware.","The instructor provides us with useful worksheets during our discussion sections that review the material we have learned so far in the week.","The skills developed can be used in future class, for example the stoichiometry or naming elements. It happened in class.","Almost every class he encourages us to talk to the students sitting next to us to work on problems. He specifically tells us to talk to our group - mates.","Did not have policy for missed exams or quizzes, when I was sick I was told I would get a 0 on my quiz, which is fine as it is dropped but its quite unfair regardless.","She mentioned multiple TA opportunities that would be provided in the future for those who would like to do that in the future, also about what premed fields would benefit from the chem classes. She also gave us more accessible classes of chemistry based on our learning rate.","He encourages us to come to not only his office hours but the ta office hours as well. He also wants us to ask questions in class while he is giving lectures.","During our discussion sections, our TA, [Removed], often brings up misconceptions or problems that are easy to trip up on. This makes the discussion sections incredibly valuable to participate in, because I certainly caught myself on one of these mistakes on the exam I just took.","In each class, we have pre - lectures that allow us to think about and ask questions before we even enter the classroom. During class, whenever the instructor asks a question, we first discuss it with our classmates before responding to him. This approach helps us engage more deeply with the material and develop our understanding through both independent reflection and collaborative discussion.","The instructor would put up an example problem / question and encourage students to discuss with their neighbors on how to solve the problem and what the solution is.","She made review slides and practice exams","ut insta - poll","Before the exam this week there was multiple opportunities that was given to the class to help us succeed.","Being able to retake a test shows that the professor wants us to learn from mistakes and do well.","He has stated that students are welcome to reach out and let him know if any particular circumstance is preventing the student from performing and focusing on school.","Dr. [Removed] asks us to turn to the people next to us and try to work through problems before working them out.","The syllabus states that we have to opportunity to correct exams. After the first exam, Dr. [Removed] discussed this process.","Through our lab photos and reports we are able to really reflect on what we are doing in lab and why we are doing it. We do these every week as a way to tie everything together.","In class, the instructor gave us the opportunity to give feedback via this survey. This survey was crucial for the class as she would take the feedback and try and implement into class.","The instructor of this course said it right at the beginning when the syllabus was being introduced. However, this did not persist as time passed.","In class she always starts with a topic discission questions that allows for us to share experience and interest outside of course.","Our instructor requires us to watch lessons that involve modern day research and ethical discussions where our class discusses the recent issues. Not only do our peers discuss these issues, but there is always different perspectives from those affected by the material discussed and expert discussions or articles.","Dr. [Removed] would incorporate students' interests by having real - life examples of an experiment she was explaining to us. Such as, the exploding balloon experiment where each balloon has a different gas and would explode in different colors.","Dr. [Removed] understands that many of her students are pre - med. She often expresses how the material we are learning will help us on the [Removed] and as a physician. Additionally, sometimes she will give us physics questions that we answer by a show of hands. She will then ask us to defend our answer, and she expresses how being able to defend what you believe or explain things to someone is important for our careers.","The instapolls given in class would force us to analyze data and preform mathematical problems. This would usually happen in the middle of class after talking about the specific topic.","She has review sessions after midterms.","He will bring up random topics I'm forgetting exactly what right now but he does it fairly often.","Once she asked us in a [Removed] [Removed] \" How we feel about the replacement exams? \". She always puts questions in this platform related to the content learned.","I don't remember a question where multiple choices were correct.","Professor [Removed] often connects the basic concepts we learn to more complicated ones that progress in higher areas of learning and employment.","We are able to take multiple attempts on quizzes, as well as ask questions before submitting assignments to ensure we do it right.","Every class there is a in class instapoll where students have to answer a question to the best of their ability. Then the question is discussed by the teacher after all students have put in their response.","We went over reflection 2 in class.","During lectures we were asked to use the things we had learned in the learning modules to figure out answers to problems presented.","Provided links and things of the nature for us to go to when we needed guidance.","It was more inclined that he shared his own interests rather than letting others. Mostly just ice breaker type things so we can get to know the instructor more. Still nice to have happen.","She gives us learning modules to do that can help us get an understanding of what is going on. Also the lecture material helps a little too, but sometimes she can go too fast during the lecture and I can lose track sometimes.","While I can not recall such a moment, especially given that most of the content discussed in the course is about R and not about people or ideas, I marked that she did so since I believe she would have done so if an opportunity was present.","She lets the students discuss topics with their neighbors.","He gave us a presentation about study abroad and told us where to go and how to get information. He also gives us information on office hours for him and other TAs.","In the last class that was held on Wednesday, my teacher went over course schedules and classes we need to take or look at for our certain majors. Whilst going over it, she engaged with us and had us individually open the website and look at our classes. Before moving on she explicitly asked if we had any questions regarding the different degrees or courses and answered them well. Even after that, she waited because she felt there was a question lingering that had not been answered.","i think she said our final exam replaces our lowest exam grade","Assuming I understand what this means ; applying physics content to something everybody can experience or understand. The universal apartment experience, having been in a car or any moving vehicle at some point, moving a box across the floor. This happens at least once a week to demonstrate the concepts.","He always asks us if we understand topics after doing practice problems. When explaining solutions and answering questions, he asked multiple times if the answer he gave was sufficient.","Said to a student that they should not be worried about asking questions.","The course promotes the [Removed] [Removed] [Removed], which is made of undergraduate students all around the world.","As we prepped for our most recent quiz, she highlighted why we have various assignments that help maintain our grades. She wants us to know that we have the ability to learn the content and not focus so much on the grade.","[Removed] really apply to me but I haven't heard any complaints from others.","N / [Removed], didn't happen","During class, instapolls are completed so the professor can receive feedback on how students are feeling about certain topics, tests, or assignments, in the class.","She actually leads one discussion session so we get a better understanding of her as a person and she also loves having her office hours. She brings snacks and chats with us whenever she has the chance.","The instructor asks students to answer questions and share their ideas on the topics during lecture. This happens at least once per lecture.","I frankly just learned more \n","She reminds us that these topics need to be spread out and require for us to think conceptually which can take time.","They are respectful and don't make students feel dumb","Our quiz questions are very interactive and Professor [Removed] really promotes group work and interactive activities. Whenever we would finish our quiz questions she usually opens up the room for us to discuss our answers and explain how we got our answers to our classmates.","YAY","In this class, almost everyday, the instructor uses [Removed] to ask us questions regarding class content. The [Removed] serves as a useful resource to test our knowledge and also serves as an attendance tracker.","In [Removed] 301, Dr. [Removed] regularly encouraged us to explore advanced topics by providing a curated list of resources related to our current unit, including articles, videos, and online simulations. This usually happened after major lectures, where he would say, “ If you're interested in diving deeper, check out these resources ; they'll give you a broader perspective on today's material. ” These recommendations not only enriched our understanding but also inspired many of us to pursue independent projects beyond the standard curriculum. \n","The opportunities include in the syllabus, as when taking quizzes, students have the opportunity to complete a second attempt if they make mistakes the first time. Because the students have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and earn a higher score on their quizzes, the above phrase is demonstrated.","Dr. [Removed] will encourage us to talk to our peers around us by implementing the question of the day and have us discuss with our neighbor about what is happening in our lives. She also encourages study groups as well.","There would be a problem in the slides following immediate coverage of the topics that that problem covers. This allows us to have a basic understanding fresh on our minds and apply that understanding accordingly. She does this frequently, at least twice per lecture. She explained the basics before and then wrote down answers while describing them, connecting them to the basic teachings. She provides plenty of time to answer.","In this class, we work together in groups and are encouraged to ask questions during lecture. We have to work with our group to solve problems every day.","Dr. [Removed] says that everyone learns differently, but we are all capable of learning, just in different ways. She suggests different strategies for solving a problem and goes over different ways of thinking to show us this is true. She also shows us how some ways of thinking can lead us down the wrong path in different examples.","Emphasizes the learning experience","She gives us time after every question she asks us to discuss with our peers surrounding us and ask the TAs near us questions. We always have time to talk through our answers.","The class is taught very well and thoroughly. You need no prior knowledge of physics to do well in this class but it wouldn't hurt.","There are small breaks within the class to work on example problems and discuss it with a partner.","During any of the lectures, after discussing a new topic, he asks if anyone has any questions before moving on. Additionally, he does examples problems and instapolls, short quizzes, that encourage group discussion and help misunderstand the material better.","I think I remember we once analyzed a picture in our discussion worksheets as a group and that was fun. I believe it was the second week of school.","Sometimes in class Professor [Removed] will mention how genetics can tie into research, technology or medicine. She provides weekly / daily updates with seminars we can attend that cover various fields related to biology and different research opportunities.","She has not really talked much about studying strategies in class. Yet, she still provides study materials that suggest ways to approach studying the material that mention why other ways may not work as well, such as suggesting that we memorize every word on a slide or we will not actually know it.","After our second exam, the instructor asked us what we thought the most difficult questions were. Then, we talked through how to solve them. Next, the instructor showed us how to work through the most commonly missed question. This took place the next class meeting after our exam and before the retake exam. The instructor stressed that they wanted us to understand our mistakes so we could learn from them. They also acknowledged the question was very difficult which was reassuring to hear as a student.","Dr. [Removed] will do this after exams and talk about the most missed questions.","We use a lot of real - life examples in the course where we are able to connect the formulas and problems we are doing with things that happen in everyday life. Using [Removed] - [Removed] has also showed me ways I can apply it to doing other research that I am interested in.","The instructor went into detail about the professions one can go into with knowledge in ecology. They described the market for each profession and what they entail.","In the quizzes or prelabs, there are questions that are open - ended. It means that there are many correct answers and she wants us to know that there isn't always one answer to just a question.","[Removed] [Removed] always takes a moment to let us solve questions by ourselves. This happens during every lecture.","Dr. [Removed] provided some background in her undergraduate experience that led up to her now. This included interests as well as clubs that she was in.","He always gives us time to collaborate with each other to try to solve problems before he brings the class back together. It makes the class significantly more engaging that just being lectured at for 50 min [Removed]","At the start of most of the lectures, the professor has an ice - breaker type of question where we can talk with the people around us. This allows us to share our interests and get to know each other.","[Removed] gives us so many [Removed] question types, review sheets, and practice exams. All of these resources make it so that it's easy to do well in her course, as long as you put the effort in and utilize her resources.","He acknowledges how there are people who have different goals within the class.","She was nice.","Our course involves the [Removed] [Removed] Project, which is a organization that is trying to discover new antibiotics. We as students are trying to discover these antibiotics from soil sample we collected. This incorporates a real life problem where we need more antibiotics to fight off illnesses","At the beginning of the term, Professor [Removed] gave us an assignment that included writing a few things about ourselves on a notecard. During the assignment, he went over the syllabus of the class and provided details about what to expect in the class and where to go for help.","[Removed] / A","Sorry I'm not one hundred percent sure what he said because i forgot. But i do remember him bringing up some stuff","Incentivizes students to give feedback on the course through surveys.","Dr. [Removed] shows us demos of a few of the problems we see in class. These demos are very insightful and help us visualize what happens in the natural world.","Dr. [Removed] goes through questions asked in the square cap and answers them in class. He does this at least once, but sometimes twice in a class period depending on when the questions are asked.","She used our real world data for our lab","Every class the professor does a \" one word check - in \" on [Removed] to see how the class is feeling. She also asks us how we are doing with other stuff going on in our lives, such as exams in other classes or other obligations outside of her class.","My instructor regularly publishes instapolls in class time with practice questions.","She lets us talk to our neighbor in class when she asks a question. This helps us learn the material better.","The teacher views us like people with lives and interests not only students who should be studying.","When going over the syllabus, professor [Removed] discussed this and there's links to the different resources. Professor [Removed] emphasized reaching out to him if any issues or inconveniences are presented.","They discussed this after the first exam. They explained that their performance was indicative of their effort, and listed options to succeed on the next exam.","At the start of the course and before each major exam, the professor encourages students to reach out to the Office of Student Disabilities if they need accommodations for the exam.","We had videos about all kinds of different cultures and their impacts and demonstration of truth to everyone","She waited for students to answer and would try to give hints / help if there was silence.","With [Removed] [Removed] that are conducted in class, Dr. [Removed] will have a few that will have several correct answers. These polls are specifically asked with processes within a cell.","Dr. [Removed] always goes through student questions before the square cap questions start every class.","Our test was coming up so he made we were aware of accommodations. This happened in the last week. He gave us options of if we need a makeup or accommodation.","Dr. [Removed], gave us time before class to discuss with a partner on our goals. She gives us time to actually debrief, and share what is important to us with others, before starting another long week of classes.","As most instructors do Dr. [Removed] talked us over on where to access [Removed]. bio references for [Removed]. She also provides the occasional study for us to look over or reading assignments to work on our own leisure.","This past week, my class was learning about different types of bonds. Dr. [Removed] had models of them and she mentioned how she bought them when she was in college and how they are still helpful / useful to that day. She then said how you never know what information will be helpful in the future and how chemistry information can be helpful in the future.","He allows us to correct our exams, only if we show a clear problem solving method. He is also very encouraging to students to come to his office hours.","She said to please email the TA in charge of accommodations as soon as possible so they can set it up.","Dr. [Removed] always emphasizes that it is okay to make mistakes and if we are making mistakes, then that means that we are truly learning. She ensures that everyone feels comfortable and even says to \" take it one day at a time \" at the end of all of her emails, which makes me feel more motivated.","The procedure sheet given at each lab table really helped me understanding the lab. Often, I get lost on what to do, so it's a nice change that instructor provided clear instruction.","Last class we actually had disucssions on our favorite scientists.","Dr. [Removed] explained that no matter what grades we have gotten we can always begin to alter our methods to achieve a higher grade and that we have the potential to do so. This was last week at the beginning of a lecture.","Learning modules ( generally due before every class ) are accepted late with no penalty up until the exam for the unit, as stated in the syllabus.","We have unlimited attempts for homework submissions along with two attempts for our quizzes. This goes for every homework and quiz. This is written in many emails and in the syllabus for our use and knowledge.","He does reflections. In these reflections we can provide feedback and also mention what we like and dislike. Also how we can improve as students","The instructor talked about their college experience and how she achieved her goals.","Professor [Removed] has us sit in pods, and she often gives us the opportunity to talk about personal things, from what we did over the weekend to what our favorite snack is! She'll often talk about things happening outside of class, such as Halloween celebrations and more.","She always says \" we will come back to this and practice more. \"","The professor often encourages us to work in groups during class to work on practice problems, the labs are also done in class and she provides opportunities for us to make a group agreement plan to create clear expectations.","We constantly work on assignments related to learning more about antibiotics and the antibiotic crisis in the world right now.","Dr. [Removed] has reflections for exams.","I have been having medical conditions and Dr [Removed] has always checked up on me if I need extra time doing my homeworks.","She has told us how we can use the techniques we have learned in other labs","Dr. [Removed] is very positive and introduces physics in a positive light, as she wants all her students to succeed in her class. She always calls the students \" future doctors, \" which is motivating as I remember the purpose of the class and encourages me to learn. She always encourages us to ask questions and to reach out for help.","He always says his office ours to come and talk, the LA's hours, and material posted on canvas.","Instructors would observe how long it would take us to do each lab and what are results looked like. If most of us were unsuccessful in a certain procedure, they would tweak the process to make it more accurate and efficient for the students.","I do not remember the exact moment before and after. I remember my instructor saying the words.","I would not say they did this in particular but with every presentation someone does they empower them, and empower their students with their understanding of the subject and what they have learned.","She says to keep trying even if you are struggling, there are resources to help and excel in the class.","The professor provided links and resources to explore learning courses related to using [Removed].","Professor [Removed] always makes us interpret mathematical models. She familiarizes us with certain mathematical equations that will be helpful for us during exams and throughout the course.","Dr. [Removed] would assign prelabs each Tuesday before lab times so that students are able to understand what the material is about before attending their lab. This allowed students to do well in their labs because they were able to do the prelab before the actual lab.","A student miscalculated the genotype ratios for a dihybrid cross during a genetics lab on [Removed] squares. Rather than continuing, the teacher stopped the lesson, explained the student's error in detail, and illustrated how it may cause misconceptions when forecasting inheritance patterns. \" Mistakes like these are great because they show where our understanding can improve — let's work through it together, \" the instructor encouraged everyone, transforming the mistake into a teaching moment for the class as a whole.","We are able to see the mistakes we made on the test and correct our self's from those mistakes","She gives us these styles of surveys a few times a semester with the hope we reflect on our time in the class.","She displays practice problems and gives us about 2 - 3 minutes to answer before she closes the instapoll.","He has instapolls that help gauge overall student understanding, no matter the answer he goes through each one to ensure that everyone understands.","She includes different examples of diseases and other relevant examples that apply to the genetics topic that we are learning in that class that day. For example, she brings up the example of the [Removed] disease in order to apply to the topic of slippage and triplet repeats that occur in DNA sequences in the [Removed] region. Using this example helps us visualize what are the consequences of the mutation occurring in our DNA sequence in the real world.","he provides reflection assignments to do on canvas","He tells us every Friday how he saw our scores for quizzes and not to worry because there are more opportunities.","In lecture, he described how he failed his first physics exam. He told us that he dove into the readings and examples and did great in the class afterwards.","One lecture our instructor discussed effective and ineffective study strategies, as well as instructing us to construct an academic planner for a class ( or multiple if we so chose to. ) We later followed up the following lecture with our academic planner by comparing it to our peers, allowing us to gage the importance of time management.","At the beginning of the semester, we answered [Removed] questions with questions about our interest, hobbies, and aspirations are.","I don't remember specifically but it was not anything out of the ordinary. While going over the content through slides I recall the professor asking a general question to the whole class and he picked on a select few to answer specifically.","There have been many instances when the instructor has provided information for the resources we have on campus and how to use them to our advantage.","At the end of class sometimes, there is an instapoll about how the students feel about the course. If there is extra help required, there are office hours available to meet.","My instructor has always encouraged discussion in our lab groups! Since my lab group is super friendly, we have always had conversations about our lives outside the lab, and the four of us also planned to meet outside lab because we became such good friends as well!","We do demos in class everyday to show real life examples of the content we are learning!","She has more than once made us remember our value as students by stating that it is hard to get into [Removed]. She started saying this around mid way through the semester.","At the beginning of the year, he told us about his obsession with the moon and described his reasearch and shared some info about the moon.","She asked us to fill surveys out which happeend for extra credit. Also, we are free to post our opinions on [Removed] if there is anythign we would like to change. I don't remember the exact words or when it happened, but i remember she always asked for feedback in the beginning of the year when everyone was struggling.","In the beginning of one of Dr. [Removed]'s lectures, she expressed how everyone at [Removed] worked hard and deserves to be attending [Removed]. She then emphasized that students are more than capable enough to get through her course because of how far they've already made it. \n","I was having trouble with the labflow and she offered to meet with me to figure out the issue if I could not do it by myself. She also replied to my emails quickly and was very understanding and supportive of my situation.","She tells us to do the learning modules ahead of class and to prepare by doing the practice exams. The professor has also told us we need to find our own strategies of learning since everyone is different.","Near the beginning, he talked about how this class would help us learn this difficult subject. He also described his own past experiences after the first exam.","Students are typically lost when the concepts are introduced fresh for instance when Dr. [Removed] hand - writes a problem for students to solve. At each point, he does something new or explains it applied in the problem he'll stop and ask \" Is everyone good \" or \" Any [Removed] \" and there would be this awkward silence that would happen giving students a chance to maybe even come up with a question in that time.","Before we start any square cap questions he answers any comments or discussions during lecture. He also has a a series of comments on certain lifestyles in diet relating to the topic.","The professor points out information that will be developed in more advanced chemistry courses","Dr. [Removed] has within her syllabus resources for any type of emergency that can affect your academics. I personally have needed to use them and Dr. [Removed] was able to help me when these events took place.","In some topics where we need to do research, the teacher recommend us some website to look through. And sometimes encourage us to look through some of them and read the ones that attract us more.","The professor will first go through a slide show to show concepts and relate them to other things occurring in nature, particularly within the realm of space and [Removed]. Then, he will switch over to handwritten notes that we can follow along with for the calculations and plugging numbers in. He writes at a slow and cohesive pace that makes it easy to keep up with and understand the material.","He asked us to discuss / explain a concept to each other during the square cap sessions and encouraged us to work together at the end of class.","During lectures, sometimes my instructor informs us about additional websites that relate to the physics problems we do in class. Today, he told us to check a website if we were interested in learning more about that topic specifically.","During multiple lectures, the professor begins by stating that there are office hours throughout the week where students can get help. During these hours, many questions are answered.","Dr. [Removed] helps us reflect on how physics relates to other subjects","The late policies are in the syllabus.","During the first day of class, and during several class times afterward, Dr. [Removed] had said things along the line of, “ Definitely do not study by yourself if you're struggling. Go form study groups. Remember, if you are struggling, it's probably not just you. ”","Dr. [Removed] always encourages us to go to office hours, academic communities, and Friday recitations. As well as informing us about [Removed] Learning in [Removed].","every time he is working though a problem he will tell us to check in with our neighbor before proceeding.","During the first day of class, she mentioned all the resources that is available for us if we needed help. During the course, she also mentioned her own struggles as an international student at [Removed] and mentioned how she received help from people she met here and encouraged us to do the same.","Once, Dr. [Removed] told us about how she minored in [Removed] and how the double major was difficult. But this gave us inspiration that it is possible to do both and they go hand in hand.","I don't remember it happening.","When we were learning about magnetism he showed how the magnetism we were learning related to his research. He researches magnetism to for semi or super conductors ( idk remember which one ) and improving [Removed] images.","When we do practice problems, he gives us feedback on how we did.","Almost all of our work is done on real datasets. Also our project let us independently look at city of [Removed] datasets and study them.","Our instructor gave us time to gather our thoughts before breaking us off into discussion groups.","Dr. [Removed] explained on the first day that it didn't matter if you took high school physics, AP, or college level, anyone could succeed in his course. One thing that made a really good impression on me is that Dr. [Removed] admitted to failing a physics course in his schooling, which made it a lot easier to relate to him, and I knew he was down to earth and genuinely a good person.","Generally, I've understood that if you missed an assignment, you couldn't make it up unless you had an excuse and emailed him.","He always mentions in the class days during the exams to email or talk to him about accommodations and how he'll work with students to get them what they need.","He uses [Removed] and it shows the results of everyone every class.","They don't seem to enjoy interacting with students because the only reason that people end up in her office hours is to navigate some academic faults so whenever she comes to class to explain her office hours experience, it seems negative and unfortunate outcomes protrude from it.","That is exactly what this is. She has mentioned a few times that she likes to do these so that she can understand where we are in the course, and how she can improve.","She tells us about all the resources we can access and highly encourages us to study in groups. She also has us help each other on insta polls and collaborate.","[Removed] would mention in most labs that she's happy to speak to students about anything regarding class in her office hours, and makes sure to keep us informed when anything changes or moves to zoom.","During every class session, we are given at least one insta poll to answer. She gives us time to really thunk about the question to answer it to the best of our ability. The question typically pertains to the information we are learning during the lecture.","[Removed] exams [Removed] the end of the semester","The professor would talk about her struggles in the physics field and relate them to people of different backgrounds to show that it does not matter what your background is. The professor said all that matters is that you do not give up. This had happened about a week or two ago.","When she is asked a question, which she will spend time explaining it. This happened a lot at the beginning of the course.","gives us retakes","During class we have groups and we work with those around us. This happens during class and around two times per lecture.","I remember Dr. [Removed] telling us that we can reach out for help in the beginning of the course. She mentioned her office hours so we could meet and talk to her.","It was for a survey with a question asking us about our current relationship status.","The class is mostly premed majors so it's nice to see examples that also appeal to us","We are encouraged to answer questions in class even if we might make mistakes. The instructor always demonstrates how mistakes can be valuable learning opportunities for the class.","She has explained how the procedures are similar or different to other procedures done in other labs outside of this course.","n / a","Dr. [Removed] gives us surveys to fill out for extra credit so she can see how she is doing.","Dr. [Removed] always tells us that we can thrive in the class, and how we can still learn more. She is so sweet and so encouraging.","We have talked about the various resources available to us when discussing mental health.","This is something they can't explain for us. The teacher and TA assist us when needed.","My instructor talks to every table group alot and knows every one of our names mostly. The instructor also makes conversation with us if we have time about where we are from and what our goals are.","On our first midterm, majority of students missed a specific question. The professor went through the solution in the class after the midterm and explained the answer and told us that for corrections on that specific question we could receive full credit instead of half credit.","Our instructor makes sure to create opportunities for us to work with peers and collaboratively learn the material through things such as the [Removed] [Removed] and example problems givne to use throughout the lectures. When given these our instructor encourages us to work with the people next to us and learn the material and how to solve the problems together.","The professor at the beginning of class always encourages everyone on far we have come on our first semester of college. She also encourages some people to get their act together as we are reaching the end of the unit.","we can get a question wrong on the first exam then learn from our mistakes and get it correct on the retake","We almost always practice a lab procedure before we do it with our soil isolates. That way, we can make mistakes and be prepared for the real procedure.","While going over a topic, our professor may demonstrate a problem the incorrect way to show how easy it is to make mistakes when not paying close attention. She then goes back and shows us the correct way to solve a problem while explaining why that is the correct method and why we should not follow the previous demonstration.","During class the professor went over some responses to a poll about what is or isn't working for students as far as the format of the class and difficulty of the content.","Not entirely sure, but I think during the first class she mentioned that student feedback is helpful during class in forms of questions so that everyone can understand better. She does this frequently through each class.","When introducing concepts, the instructor tends to give the history behind the discovery / impactful applications of the principle to modern physics. This history is focused on physics, not really anything controversial or taboo.","[Removed] gave us a chemistry question and asked us to talk about it with the people next to us. She will then tell us the answers.","She mentioned how one of the topics was relevant to the medical field and is used in medical practice.","This survey exactly! And then professor always tells us to speak up whenever we feel lost or uncomfortable with the pace of the material covered in class!","[Removed] has a lot of mistakes and she is able to help us","She always shares and encourages us to join her office hours. During her office hours, she brings snacks and makes the time very enjoyable and filled with useful information about future assignments and topics.","We work with a lot of data in the class, a lot of which has to do with many different groups of people","Asks us what we think about materials and assignments","she offers conferences and events outside of class","This is something Dr. [Removed] has not touched on explicitly. However, she is always encouraging us to think of the material we are learning beyond what we need to know for the exam.","The instructor emphasized that there were office hours held by TAs on the first day. He also repeated this information in the following weeks.","The professor usually uses examples that are simple objects that everyone knows to demonstrate properties or any sort of happenings that we are learning.","Dr. [Removed] has an \" Exam [Removed] \" tab on her canvas page that has resources for many materials for upcoming exams. She has review notes that are extremely helpful if you need help with a certain topic in the lecture.","My teacher lets us collaborate and answer questions that are on the board at least once every class.","The instructor encourages us to talk to each other and teach each other concepts. During lecture we take 1 or 2 mins to talk questions out with each other. The instructor uses words like \" talk it out \".","She talked about it","Everytime we come into the lab, we work with those at our table and are able to not only work with them in the lab, but spend time working on group assignments outside of the lab that allow us to spend time with each other and really connect over the content. With more time together, it's hard not to get to know someone, and we are always free to talk with each other during the lab time ( as long as we are getting our work done ).","Dr. [Removed] described activities she enjoys outside of her career.","[Removed] / A","Not exactly sure when, but Prof [Removed] has told us stories of past students who woul struggle initially with the course but were able to improve through recieving extra help outside of class.","There is a specific page on her canvas page that allows students access to examples of how to study for physics. We were shown this the first day of the class, and the location is discussed in the syllabus.","The instructor gives us a plethora of class materials to study and learn. We have pre - class modules that walk us through concepts before class, an extensive exam review guide, and multiple ways to ask for help.","Prior to taking the first exam of the course, Dr. [Removed] provided us with the cheat sheet he would use if he was taking the exam. This was beneficial for me as it provided a solid foundation for what my cheat sheet should look like. This was also my first college exam, so this may have been more valuable to me than other students.","At the beginning of the semester she offered an extra credit assignment where we got to say what our names were and some facts about our background. She went through each video and replied to all her students.","We work in groups during certain homework problems, allowing us to connect with our peers.","I do not really remember when but I do remember my professor talking about the mental health resources.","I can not remember an exact example","People were struggling with the 5 pm deadline for our assignments, so she listened and changed it to be due at midnight.","Asked us to submit a reflection","My TA every week would mention that her office hours are available.","Explains everything like it's our first time, discusses the problem, and explains what happens","Throughout class we would solve different problems and each step he would ask a section of the room to share their answers","Shows us interesting applications of physics, such as hitting a golf ball on the moon!","Just this week we reviewed the [Removed] to find our registration time. This is very helpful in my planning for registration.

She also posts events that are available for a limited time.","My instructor has made it known where to look for help and who to go to. She does this every class.","We went over the importance of stats in the very beginning of course in order to see the greater benefit in the long run.","She tries to incoraporate real word examples when explaining certain concepts to try to make the concept more understandable and applyable.","We have a project that incorporates using real data sets. This was given to us in the second month of class.","We have done certain problems where the question is asked to answer all that is applicable which fits into the criteria for this question.","She is very considerate in reminding students about office hours as well as reviews for the exams that will happen in the future.","The professor tells the whole class that there is wiggle room for any emergency that pops up. She understands that a lot of the students have a life outside of school and that there are many thing that could unexpectedly happen. I believe she told us this either this week or last week.","After a unit exam, scores were significantly lower than the previous unit across the department, so our professor asked us to reflect and share ( via an instapoll ) what we believe was the reason behind the average lower scores on that specific content.","I can't remember","Dr. [Removed] posted all of the specific resources for each exam at the very beginning at the semester.","During class, there are numerous instapolls that we are told and asked to work on with our neighbors. This allows for you to ask questions and get help from others or provide them with help. I really enjoyed this aspect of the class.","When looking at our bacteria last week, she said she hasn't seen anything like our sample before. She was excited about it and said it's a great research opportunity!","Our instructor has foundational information in his textbook. This information is very helpful to review prior to lectures.","She always gives us time to solve problems before going over them with us to challenge our thinking. This happens almost every class.","She always says we are the future of science and makes note that compared to when she was a student there are more women taking stem courses and that it's cool to see the future of science be so diverse.","often in class, she will ask a question and give the students a few minutes to talk the problem out with their peers.","He teaches well","The instructor told us what questions were more tricky and how it would be tricky. The instructor would say to pay particular attention.","My instructor emphasized that we should all be participating within the survey and stressed that it was very important information for the univestity.","Dr. [Removed] simply encourages to get to know others around us in lecture. Outside of class, he also provides office hours and reviews to meet other students.","She created lecture slides for us to take notes off of in class and provided them to us to download and write on as well.","I don't exactly remember but she mentioned how she provides lecture content videos and videos on R which are quite helpful for when we work on our labs.","I do not know what this question means or what it is asking. I do not think it matters what kind of background somebody has. Everyone is learning the same material. Everyone fights their own battles if that answers this question.","I feel like my instructor has not incorporated pop culture references into our course lectures. However, I'm not really affected by it because I feel like there is a lot of chemistry lecture material that we should go over instead of having references.","He made it clear about what we are graded based on. He has also mentioned in advance when we are not gon na have class but what must be completed","I can't recall","We have weekly lab reports that need our lab and outside knowledge to interpret what we have done that week. They are open - ended and are dependent on your lab group.","When going over a squarecap question during class, she talked about common errors. She worked through it the correct way and explained how people may have gotten a different answer.","In the canvas course, students are able to access resources necessary to be successful in class. In addition they can always reach out to Professor [Removed] via office hours.","In the first few days of class, Dr. [Removed] specified that the syllabus outlined the late assignment / exam policy for students to refer to for accomodations to be made.","I believe she said it on the second day of Unit 4 when going over thermodynamic signs. She said something along the lines of \" This can easily confuse people so please make sure you have a firm grasp on the subject \"","Our instructor illustrated two real world examples of effective and ineffective studying habits and the consequences of each ; one being cramming and the other involving studying half an hour everyday a few weeks before the exam.","[Removed] / A","On Tuesdays we get placed into discussion groups that work on assignments, and provide explanation when students are confused. We also review notes from previous lectures, so we are all more prepared for the exam.","Talked about pre med and the futures that apply what we are learning.","For the final, we can retake 2 tests of our choice","We get these opportunities through discussion sections held once a week in which we work through practice problems related to the current class topic with fellow classmates.","The TAs often takes into account how the students would like to work during discussion sections.","My professors have gone over necessary resources.

They also upload extra practice problems on [Removed], reminding us that these resources are \" here to reinforce our understanding and prepare us for exams. \"","The instructor would post a poll to have us answer a question based on what we'd learned that day. This happens at least once a week.","She shared that she and her daughter were big [Removed] [Removed] fans and that they had attended some concerts in the past. This happened maybe 2 times in the past month.","Can't really remember right now","On course [Removed], we can post any questions we may have. She always encourages us to check that out and talk to others, help others, or ask questions ourselves.","Gives us two minutes to answer insta polls and asks us to talk through questions","On the homework there will be questions that we have equations for but haven't yet done in class. This homework is weekly and encourages us to apply skills we cover in class to more complex problems.","In one lecture, Dr. [Removed] asked our [Removed] to have a presentation about his project.","She connected lecture material to pre med students. She also lets us talk to each other about stuff","Dr. [Removed] always encourages her students by telling us that we can master the material no matter what our background may be. She always tells us certain past experiences that she has had and how they have shaped her to where she is at now.","The professor likes to include real - world examples and events into our lectures to help with understanding. For example, she might include a past research or something like global warming and how it affects ecology.","just mentioned what experience you need with code when starting the class","instructor posted a thread on [Removed], stating where to reach with any specific question ( e.g. TA, email, etc. ) \n\n [Removed] itself is an ongoing Q&amp;A platform for anything related to the course","The syllabus states very clearly the late policy for assignments and for extraordinary concerns.",".","The nature of the course questions requires you to often draw your own conclusions about the problem given prior knowledge of math concepts. As a result understanding of math models is a need for success in this class.","This primarily occurs during our discussion sections where a couple of questions are posed to the students of which we must answer in a given time frame. These questions require a different set of logical skills and thinking that are not normally tackled in the textbook. Additionally, there is a wide array of feedback from the TAs in order to steer us in the right direction.","She has office hours that I try to attend each week, and I often ask her questions about the homework. She helps us solve through questions together.","The instructor told us to check the information on the syllabus which we have had access to all year. This happened towards the beginning of the year before our first exam.","n / a","The instructor provides students with opportunities to reflect on the effectiveness of their learning and studying strategies by giving us \" quiz reflections \" after each quiz. The instructor also typically speaks briefly about how to succeed in the course.","At the end of every homework set Dr. [Removed] has three questions that we can choose to answer as the 5th hw problem. These questions encourage us to apply what we learn in class to a real world situation in the world or our lives.","In the beginning of the course the instructor asked us to turn to the student next to us and share something we were really good at, and the process it took to become really good at what we chose to share.","Dr. [Removed] reaches out to students who are falling behind or not succeeding.","She let's us work together to solve instapoll and practice problems during class and goes through it with us afterwards.","For every homework, she asks us to write reflection on things that we understand or no. On the test, she also asks us to write reflection, asking us to describe a topic we know.","She would present us with a task during class and we would be asked to work together in groups to complete it. We would then discuss as an entire class our results","Our professor has let us know that we have any comments, questions, or concerns we are more than welcome to bring them up with her personally or a TA. To ensure that our concerns our being heard and we are given help if needed.","She spoke on the relevance of the lecture material to her career.","Dr. [Removed] has resources on [Removed] that she posts that are specific for prerequisite material. She also mentions these resources in class sometimes.","Every time that an exam is taken he allows every student to retake the exam. This allows for students to earn back their credit for that exam and it gives a great learning opportunity that isn't given to many in other classes","We do instapolls with multiple answers","She has done this once and it was just to give us the background of the formula we were learning or who came up with the laws we were learning at the time.","On a lot of the assignments that we are to complete on our own, there are always ethical questions on certain aspects of data analysis. For example, one of the homework talked about ethical complications with data.","Dr. [Removed] will provide videos in the canvas homeworks that are not required to watch, but if you wish to they provide extra demos or material regarding the current unit.","Whenever we examine a chemistry concept in class, there are generally models or practice problems involving data that we must evaluate. This allows for interpretation of models and data in the context of what we discuss.","When we enter into lab and we need to work as a group or pair off, the instructor is the one to remind us to work collaboratively and to share the workload.","Her syllabus is made excellently and easy to understand. Throughout the syllabus she makes her policies really clear but she also is constantly reminding us of the late policies in class and in her weekly announcements which is awesome.","Promotes growth mindset","The late policy exam and assignments are clearly written in the syllabus which was discussed during the first class of the semester. There are exceptions for emergencies, which you must communicate and document for an exception of missed assignment or coursework, and has stayed consistent since the start of the semester.","Always makes a point that our previous exam grades or whatnot isn't indicative of what we can achieve in the future.","Every single lab is done with a group.","She uses [Removed] pretty regularly.","Asked questions of class and to share with neighbor.","My instructor has a slide in her presentation for every class that includes general announcements. Often, there are times where this specific slide will mention policies for late assignments or make - up exams, and my instructor will go into detail on where to find the complete answer to these types of questions.","The instructor asks for questions or themes that are not clear through polls and addresses them later that week","There has been a few times where she allowed us to talk for 2 minutes with our peers about our weekend. This has allowed me to befriend someone.","At the end of the unit she askes a question to see where everyone is at in using [Removed] - [Removed] as well as understanding the class material. The instructor then conveys that if we have any worries or don't feel like we are grasping the material, to reach out to her or the TAs so that we can get help on where we are stuck.","Yes","This was addressed initially when we began the course, but has not really been addressed since. Dr. [Removed] does have an open door policy about her and is actually a professor that I have felt the most comfortable approaching about problems. I have approached her and the TAs in the past about questions that I had, but it is not something that is continuously brought up or encouraged.","Each assignment on [Removed] has a set due date and a rubric outlining how many points will be lost if submitted late. There is also information over this in the class syllabus.","I can't remember an specific instance, but Professor [Removed] often encourages us to work on Course packet problems in groups. Additionally, our weekly labs are done in groups as well.","During lecture, if there is a question or instapoll, sometimes Dr. [Removed] would have us discuss the answers with our table groups 1st before going over it as a class, Our table has about 5 - 6 people, and after giving us 3 - 4 minutes to discuss, she would ask some tables to share outloud, or she would go over the question herself.","I don't truly remember this, because it doesn't apply to me. I do remember him mentioning testing accommodations for those that qualify.","She spoke in depth on multiple occasions about mental health, its importance and resources we could use in case we were struggling. She also spoke about accommodations for students with disabilities.","I don't know, I just know there are academic communities for this class that have been mentioned many times.","During the beginning of the semester, Prof [Removed] went over the syllabus and policies extensively.","Dr. [Removed] often expands on certain topics to show what we will need in further classes or what specific majors may want to prepare for. She draws connections between certain chemistry topics prepare biologists or those in the medical field.","Dr. [Removed] brought up a statistician that made a very impactful visualization. I liked this because I find data communication very important.","Every day we have [Removed] questions that we collaboratively work through with our peers around us. They are typically spread out for the entire lecture, typically 2 to 3 questions. We then come together and work through it as a class.","He asks us to relate what we're learning to our dad ily life. Especially when he talks about macromolecules and he asks us to think about the meals we ate.","During office hours. \n\n","Caudill is always striving to remind us that we are all capable of doing great in her class and she constantly reassures us of all the opprutunities we have to succeed in her class despite how difficult chemisty may be.","My instructor went over common mistakes in lecture. We also discuss common mistakes during discussion.","Over some topics, She will sometimes mention how we should have learned this in highschool.","Dr. [Removed] said how the concepts we are learning will be useful in medicine and for the [Removed].","Talked about a career decision they had to make","During the first two weeks of classes this semester Dr. [Removed] made sure to tell us that we all have the potential to succeed. Dr. [Removed] told us that we could do anything if we tried and worked for it and that we were all capable of doing great it her class.","The instructor said that all students can succeed regardless of their grades on the class after our second midterm because you can retake two exams for the final.","Outside of lecture hours the instructor has office hours where they can spend more time answering student's questions for those who need more help. There is also a message board where students can post questions that can be answered by the TAs.","At least one assignment is due before every class to introduce students to the content. The assignments are significant because they guide us during the lectures and arrange the content covered in an organized way that aligns with the lectures. They are also excellent resources if we need to go back and relearn something.","Dr. [Removed] allows for the final to replace the lowest midterm grade. This shows that by the end of the semester, the student understands and knows physics better, and therefore deserves an opportunity to fix a mistake made earlier on.","In the classes, the instructor give us interactive activities that we can share with the other students. Most of the activities involves our way of think and interests.","There is an online platform called [Removed] Discussion for students to ask questions that may arise. Then, either our professor or undergraduate assistants can respond to these concerns. In addition, there are many opportunities for office hours.","We do a pre lab everyweek but I think this is just a course requirement. I don't feel like there is much studying to do outside of class, as it is more writeups/ reports and preparation for quizzes.","[Removed] told us to rate past posters for our biology lab. This was during the 2nd week of lab.","The course provides discussion sections where students can ask questions to TAs. The TAs have been extremely helpful in asnwering my questions.","This is a genetics class, so most of the historical content is the basis of genetics and [Removed].","We have to look at different graphs, models, and charts, and analyze them.","My professor congratulated us after our tests saying that we've come this far already. She's generally very supportive and does a great job with this!","I am counting the use of instapoll for both attendance and comprehension of the material the class has gone over. I am unsure if this counts as a \" polling method \", but if it does apply, it is used every almost ( if not ever ) class.","My professor always always us to talk about the material during the lecture with our peers and this is helpful at times especially when I am a little confused.","Dr [Removed] has encouraged us to think about what our work means and what other people could do to extend it. That makes me think about possible careers in research.","Once larger questions are posed to the class, the instructor will either give independent reflection time or allow students to turn and discuss with their neighbors.","Dr. [Removed] has students answer instapolls each class period. He has students work with one another to find an answer, and pushes students to chat with their neighbor if they are initially reluctant.","Power point and verbal instructions.","Dr. [Removed] uploads files of the textbook. Some of the files include math skills such as a review of integrals.","The instructor asks general questions regarding if everyone understood the procedure of the lab and even provides demonstrations regarding the harder procedures. This effectively addresses the concerns expressed by the students, and additionally, the instructor is available for further questions.","Every class our professor opens with a mini slideshow about something science related and about the people who discovered different things. One time she told us about the different scientists who won the [Removed] prize in chemistry. She makes sure to highlight the people making the discoveries which is cool.","She has stated that she has failed many times before present day. Her failing in the past only helped her future self learn more. Her prior knowledge and experiences of failure only led her to have better success.","The instructors would go through practice problems and tell the students to read the questions carefully. For example, there were lots of questions about ranking. She would tell the students to carefully read if the question is asking to rank from \" least to greatest \" or \" greatest to least. \"","Whenever I go to his office hours and have trouble on where to start studying for the exam, Dr. [Removed] points us in the right direction and says that we should go over the homeworks and do practice problems from the textbook to enhance our learning. This has helped me shape my study skills for this course.","Stated in the syllabus","He always talks about the moon tbh","We are allowed to work on instapolls together.","It was very helpful and they did a good job figuring out academic accommodations for those students.","I would say this is more in parts of the quest homework, where some questions may be some we've never seen before and or extends slightly beyond what I believe we are to know. I think may have happened in the last few homework assignments, where I try my best to figure it out and then search online to see a completely random method I've never seen, but in class he does tend to go over those types of question to help us.","Dr. [Removed] made us write a reflection at the end of class that highlighted this topic. We were asked to write about what we plan to do in the future, and how our college experiences will help us to achieve what we want.","We think independently about the lecture we just learned as we do the square cap","On the first day of class the instructor introduced herself and shared stories about her career and education.","I had never taken physics before this course, so the teacher has made me and others feel very reassured. She has wanted to know our prior knowledge so she can adapt her teaching ways. Also, after us having Test 1 she has said countless times not to worry and that we have lots of other assignments to help aid our grade.","We've taken multiple surveys throughout the semester asking us what changes could be made to the class in order to help benefit us.","This is essentially what I said in the first question I answered, but Dr. [Removed] is great about asking if there are any questions and encourages us to ask questions to her or the TAs. This happens every class period, at least once. \n\n During and after our first exam, this was also made clear and encouraged.","I can not recall exactly what she said, but I think she talked about her time as an undergrad","I don't really remember, but I remember her saying we need to manage our time well.","My instructor encourages a us to get to know our peers. She does this by pushing us to talk to those around us, and especially in the beginning of the year she would give us conversation starters. For example, she asked us to discuss with those around us where in the world we would like to travel.","Every class, Dr. [Removed] provides reassurance to students who may not have a background in physics. I am one of these students, and feel this is important, as the first two years are a time of \" levelling \", where all students will leave with the same base knowledge","Instructor emphasized this when sending out the survey to students","Sometimes, the lecture is portraying   a real life experience that some may not have experienced. However, the content is relatively understandable.","Dr. [Removed] constantly encourages students to attend office hours and always says so with a smile on her face. She makes them very approachable and easy to attend.","In our labs the TAs put on music for us while we are working and asks if we would like to add an music that we like. This happened during the first week of labs and still [Removed] this day. I genuinely like it when they play music because it feel comforting.","They keep sending reflections and surveys. This helps them see how they teach the class. He sent us a canvas message and told us in class to do it.","She assigns learning modules before we gather for lecture so we can have a somewhat understanding when she's going over the topics in lecture. It's very helpful rather than just having no clue what she's talking about.","This is when we are able to discuss various things in class. I can not recall a specific time.",":","For polls during class Dr. [Removed] encourages us to work together.","The instructor mentioned the resources during syllabus week.","During discussion, we used a real database to find data on [Removed] and [Removed] values in the [Removed] [Removed].","On the first day of school she mentioned how we might not use physics on the daily after college. However, she said that a good understanding of physics will allow us to interpret the world around us.","The Professor incorporated the real - world example when talking about ions dissociating in water. She mentioned it in class and it was in the presentation slideshow as well. She used the example of [Removed] that we see often, dissociating in water as a way for us to connect and understand the concept.","Every week our professor talks about utilizing office hours, and if people have accommodations, to contact them so their accommodations can be used. Being a type 1 diabetic, I have accommodations and the professor has made it very clear how to use my accommodations if needed","On the [Removed] page there is a very clear page labeled \" office hours and TA info \" which has a calendar for all the resources regarding extra help in the class. There's another canvas page that also has information for exam preparation.","Before we take quizzes or exams, the instructor assures us that we will be okay, as she knows we are capable of doing well. She says that we will be okay, and not to worry as she makes sure that these quizzes and exams are what we have prepared for.","The professor required everyone to submit Test [Removed] forms after the first test to ensure everyone reflected back on what they got wrong, why they got it wrong, and what to improve on in their study strategies in the future.","Our professor understands that students need access to resources to succeed. Therefore, she offers discussion sections and office hours in order to help us and discus our learning strategies to ensure we do well in the class.","I am not a student that needs any academic accommodations or anything like that so I admit I did not pay close attention when the professor would talk about this topic. I remember at the beginning of the semester her telling students to reach out if they are in need of any academic accommodations. When the last day of accommodation letters was due she also reminded students to turn in letters also.","Often times our lab groups need to discuss our results with each other and what that means for our overall research. These conversations are often started by questions posed by [Removed] to the entire class.","I think she credited an african american scienctist for an invention or discovery, highlighting it was stolen from that scientist and the credit was given elsewhere. This is a chemistry class, there isn't mch historical teaching.","Dr. [Removed] allows us to send in questions via sqaurecap during class. He takes time to answer every question after the lecture is over.","This professor has not had participation in anything other than answering the questions the professor asks. However, I do not fault her for this because many of the things we could participate in could endanger ourselves.","We record notes in our lab notebook during every lab about our scientific observations.","This never happened, I misclicked \n","We have sufficient time to work on the squarecap at the end and we are also able to write questions we have in there and he answers them after the lecture.","Having city of austin presenters present to the class","She has always talked about different biological experiments which have led to our current understanding of topics. She has talked about different types of scientists and their personal opinions which has helped give a multifaceted insight into the subject.","The instructor reminds us in class during quizzes or lecture that it is okay to be wrong because our current knowledge does not reflect our potential, and we all have potential to learn more. This happens often, maybe once every week or two.","Our professor made an annoucement regarding this","Instructor often uses examples of graphs from real research to begin lecture. Has also described path forward in data science field by discussing conferences and research projects.","Lots of good career advice and our project is like a career prep thing in a way","When he talked about torque and ramp examples.","He's obsessed with the moon. Most of our examples are about the moon! It's awesome","As we were getting closer to our exam date our instructor advised us to work with others while studying. She said it's helpful to teach someone the material you are learning as well as listen to other people's ideas and ways they remember material.","The instructor encourages us to talk to our neighbors in class for questions and instapoll. The teaching team also provides us with the opportunity to work with others during discussion section, which happens every week.","when giving introduction to our lab group","Talks about what she does as a data scientist and the types of tools she uses.","The professor would explicitly mention what common mistakes students make and walk us through multiple examples of problems regarding the topic. The mistakes she goes over are simple mistakes, like mixing up mathematical signs or confusing certain things. She is very thorough to drill it in what not to do. She does this for every unit, and only explicitly mentions the common mistakes once or twice before the exam to ensure we get the exam questions correct instead of messing up over simple mistakes.","asked us to participate in the survey.","I can't speak to this specifically but she does encourage us to use campus resources. She also tells us about opportunities on campus.","The instructor encouraged us to utilize our accomodations if we had any. She said to make sure we get testing acoomodation in the [Removed] Center. This happens before every exam.","Asking questions to the class, then explaining how to get to the answer","Dr. [Removed] would always make sure to update us on when, where, and which notes from either lectures or discussions were available on [Removed]. She would also encourage us to go to discussion as much as possible and to take advantage of the textbook so that we can have better understanding of the content.","Dr. [Removed] talked about improving our grades and learning from our mistakes after our first exam. She talked about how we could re - take exams to replace our original grade.","Our professor uses [Removed] instapoll to ask a question to the students. He then has us work with our neighbors to collaboratively find the solution and understand the concepts being presented.","One of my favorite things about Dr. [Removed] are the frequent positive [Removed] messages she sends out to the entire class. These messages are extremely encouraging and tell us to keep looking forward and improve instead of getting stuck on a possible past grade.","During lecture Dr. [Removed] constantly reminds us of the importance of asking questions. She says that everyone has a unique perspective and through asking questions we can share that perspective with each other.","Each time the class is presented with a question she gives us around 5 minutes to discuss our answers independently then with a partner. Then once the question is answered she makes sure not to move on unless the class says yes in agreeance.","n / a","She created survey and instapolls to ask us feedback and progress of projects.","He offers make up exams for every exam so if you feel bad about your exam you can take the retake.","We only did this on the first day or two of class. I can't remember exactly what we did, but it was something about sharing a fun fact about ourselves or what we did over the summer.","They talked about how the techniques we practiced in lab are going to be useful in other research environments","She goes over this in the lectures. Sometimes she also uses problems to show what some students may have trouble with.","The homework assignments are often more complex than what is covered in class and requires advanced application of the basic things we cover in lecture.","A portion of the class struggled with the second exam. Dr. [Removed] restructured to the course a bit to focus on the importance of learning the material from the exam and give the students an opportunity to meet the challenge again. \n\n He focused on growth mindset during the and after this instance","The time that stands out to me the most is when Dr. [Removed] opened up about his own experience with college and how he failed his first physics course in college. He also opened up about his struggling to adjust to college because of mental health issues.","In the beginning of the school year, she stated that by employing the right study strategies, going to student hours, and giving the appropriate amount of time and work, we can all be successful in the class. She's also provided multiple opportunities to allow students who might be behind to catch up, such as extra classes surrounding statistics and optional modules to drill the material we learn.","We are investigating real data from the city of [Removed]","Dr. [Removed] would often provide slides with prompts or discussion questions to guide our conversations. These slides encouraged us to engage with the material on a deeper level and to share our thoughts with our peers. This peer - to - peer interaction was invaluable, as it helped me to solidify my understanding of the concepts and to develop my critical thinking skills.","This is just required in physics. Every class we look for patterns especially in the kinematic unit.","The class moves fast because there are 300 people in the room, but she allows some time for TAs to go around and answer questions.","We do turn and share to either ask questions or just have a conversation about a topic","The instructor was very open about asking questions about the students' interests. [Removed], he encouraged outside interests such as research and study abroad.","After our first exam, Dr. [Removed] went over our score distribution and suggested that students closely read his textbook and do all of the assignments he provides, even if they are not taken for a grade. I hope this works for me coming up on exam 2.","Dr. [Removed] made us write down some sheets in reference to our future and what / how we would be able to use this course in preparation for our personal and professional lives.","p","He tells the class constantly that if anyone is struggling to go to office hours and ask questions. Office hours are a great way to help us learn the concepts better.","Dr. [Removed] has students change seating frequently and has us do icebreakers to get to know each other. We switched groups last week.","Dr. [Removed] encourages us to provide feedback about the course through an extra credit incentive survey. Given that there is an incentive many students provide feedback.","She sometimes talks about how physics can be used outside of the classroom. Examples include medical settings.","During lectures, she pauses and asks us to reflect on the content given and make connections as to how we can remember the content she just went over. The learning modules on [Removed] are independent but once we are in class we can ask questions.","[Removed] asks questions about the lab and why we are doing certain experiments or what certain test results mean and makes sure everyone understands why","Sometimes the professor asks us to discuss and she generally encourages interaction and collaboration active work better peers.","We do many assignments that explain what our research in lab is doing in the outside world. We also get to see examples of what this type of research has done in the past through articles.","Typically after the exam grades and class averages are released, the instructor advises students that they can support by reaching out to the instructors or the TAs.","I haven't really seen that before which is why I put slightly certain.","This week itself [Removed] [Removed] deeply explained how we all did so good on the test. This made everyone feel great because she also supported us with words of encouragement for the next test.","If we raise our hand, the teacher will answer. During short discussion though, the ta's basically just expect you to understand your own question.","The professor provides instapolls asking us how we feel about course material to gauge which topics to go over more. She also puts up extra study work if there are areas students have said they are uncertain about.","he would talk about how we traveled to the moon and incorporate it with physics","Does feedback, ask questions on what is confusing on every presentation, and promotes doing evaluations","The instructor provided a brief description of the Office of Student Disabilities under a Student [Removed] section in the syllabus, where she encourages students to reach out. She also went over the syllabus on the first class day to verbally state this.","On a quiz we recently took, there were two correct answers. She let us know beforehand","The squarecap quiz questions","We are often told to discuss with others during lectures and to work together as a group during discussion. The professor has shown many times that she believes that group work is a great way to learn.","We can be always be smarter and learn more from classes and people","Sawyer talks about the mistakes she experienced within her other lab sections and warns us to not do the same. However, it is easily seen that [Removed] understands that we as students are not perfect and is very lenient with small errors.","Dr. [Removed] told us about the topic and what we would learn from it. The topic is about enthalpy and she informed us about that.","The discussion section is well ordered and fosters a healthy learning environment. The environment is conducive to learning with one's peers and enables friendships to grow.","He has not done this.","During every other lecture she posts an [Removed] that gives us practice on the established material. The module quizzes and practice tests also provide an opportunity for us to test our knowledge prior to any big tests or assignments.","After exam scores are released, Prof. [Removed] will show us the commonly missed exam questions and explain what most people did to get it wrong, compared to what actually needed to be done to answer the question correctly.","He showed us through personal example that the grades we get here and on the first test by no means are a determining factor of our future success in [Removed] and he told us the low grade he got on his first physics test. He told us this right before or after the test.","Professor makes sure to make time in class to talk about taking care of oneself.","The instructor provided instructions on how to enroll in the [Removed] [Removed] Resource [Removed] course, which is academic support for many upper division math and science courses, in a canvas announcement ( and during the first day of class ).","The professor has talked about her cat quite a bit and used him for examples for problems, as well as using video games she's familiar with as a dataset.","[Removed] / a","The instructor told us that the best way to study for the class was by handwriting notes down and by going back over our notes after 24 hours of being in class.","Dr. [Removed] sends out announcements through [Removed] about upcoming opportunities to see a professor lecture on a topic related to genetics.","They offer resources to help this along with specific details on how to access these resources.","Whenever somebody asked a question at the end of a slide of notes Professor [Removed] would take time to address the question thoroughly. Furthermore, he would put the answer in another perspective for the student to understand either more in context with what we were currently learning or what we have learned in the past.","He mentioned the struggles that he had in college early on and how that didn't deter him from pursuing physics as he went in the second or third week. He knows that we come from different backgrounds in physics in high school, so he makes sure that we understand that and approaches the problems from the base to make it easier to understand","Offered reflections","I believe before a lecture he mentioned the services and let us know that they are available if were struggling.","my instructor uses instapoll to help us engage with course content and challenge our understanding","After every question the professor puts on the board, he asks us to discuss what we think with the people around us","After tests, she talks about her thoughts on what people need to improve upon, but never states it is something we can not recover from. She tells us that if we want to, we can always retake the bad tests at the end of the semester","The instructor uses perspectives from a variety of groups and demonstrates that we learn best by using the multitude of opinions from the class. She also allows everyone to uniquely contribute, thus bolstering this claim.","When we did bad on the first exam, he said he would not give us a curve because that's not how real world works. For doctors researching cancer, they will not find the cure by getting curves and they have to work hard for what they are doing. Because of this, he made us take a half exam for half points back for exam 2","It was about the size of an ionic molecule and how to arrange them by size. In dispersion forces the bigger the molecule the more IMFs but in ionic its different rules so it was clarified.","For example, during the beginning of the semester she gave us review slides for mitosis. She did this in order to review knowledge from last semester biology.","The instructor cares about what we have to say. She wants us to know that if we want to know the answer to something, she will provide us with exactly what we need to know.","Dr. [Removed] goes beyond what is regularly taught in comparing biology courses, as he believes that it can help us in proceeding classes. He explains how concepts we learn are not limited to this course specifically and will reoccur and can be applied to our future studies.","Provides an online textbook for us to reference, has an active ed discussion for us to ask questions, has work sessions available to us","In this course, the instructor frequently incorporated assignments that asked students to apply course concepts to unfamiliar situations. For example, midway through the semester, we were tasked with analyzing a real - world case study that hadn't been covered in class, using theories we'd learned to propose solutions. The instructor explained, “ This assignment is designed to stretch your understanding and see how these concepts work outside of examples we've already discussed. ” This approach encouraged deeper learning and helped us connect theory to practice in meaningful ways.","We created an intro video in the 1 - 2 weeks of class","The TA for the course shared his previous project early in the semester. I can't think of a time beyond that.","I think Dr. [Removed] once mentioned a meeting that the [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] was having and also said that she was a member.","Every time during class, Dr. [Removed] always makes sure to address any student questions during class if there are any after she's done teaching a specific concept or going over a problem. If she doesn't have enough time during class to get to all of them, she urges us to go to student hours.","In giving this survey, my professor emphasized the potential impacts completing it could have. This includes better education for the next batch of students and overall improvement in our own learning.","Asks about what we thought about the exam and includes instapolls for feedback. She tries to incorporate that feedback to improve the course tasks / materials. Encourages us to go to office hours and any resources to succeed. She even said to go to her office hours if we are encountering any challenges.","She encourages us to work out problems on our own before she shows us how to do it. It is helpful because it actually insights learning versus blind copying.","After we received our grades for our midterm 2nd exam, our professor encouraged us to review our exams as the average was lower. He even gave us a chance to learn and gain some points back \" success is not a linear slope so please do not be discouraged by this. \"","Mentioned a similar statement once, likely at the start of classes.","I believe this was during syllabus week. The instructor told us that we can improve out understanding in physics - we will not have to be bad at physics all our lives.","We just took an exam, she discussed with us about what went well about the exam and talked about ways that we might be able to improve on that. She also encouraged us to be diligent in our studies for the next exam.","In the demos he usually mentions the usage of specific   topics and similar","Dr. [Removed] will give us the answers to the exams and homework. She also encourages us to go to her office hours and her TA's discussion courses/ [Removed]'s.","she told people who have accomodations to use them for the quiz","Well this survey is giving feedback. However, she does ask in class on occasion to whether the way she is teaching or the speed she is teaching at helpful.","He shared the story of how he got a 57 on his first physics exam in undergrad and in graduate school. Then he talked about how he had to work to learn the material, and now he teaches engineering physics and has been doing research in the field for years.","Critical thinking required to analyze the results from soil master plates and co - culture plates.","Instructor has encouraged active participation in class. They have allowed students to independently think about concepts and apply them by themselves.","During the course, the instructor regularly asked for our feedback to help improve their teaching. After each lab session, they would encourage us to share what we liked or found difficult. This made us feel comfortable sharing our thoughts and knowing our opinions mattered. \n\n\n\n","We have these sessions called [Removed] Communities that allow us to meet other chem students and allow us to work out the problems and talk out the material to ensure we understand what she has been teaching us.","There is no pre requisite for this class","Whenever she goes over a few slides from her presentations, she will tell us to discuss with the person next to us about a practice problem","We can submit a correction after the exam that provides us half points back that we lost.","What I remember is Dr. [Removed] promoted the mental health service at the beginning of the semester when we were going over syllabus material. She has also occasion mentioned to prioritize your mental health but I can't recall exactly what or how she said this.","He said that even though people had not so pleasant experiences with physics in the past, they can still succeed.","Every mourning Professor [Removed] starts the lecture slides with a fun cool scientific slide and explains how it relates to our material and the real world. This usually ends with him talking about his own studies in the telescope field and his own jobs that he got after college [Removed].","This sounds like a positive way that [Removed] structures his discussions","He asks questions every class pertaining to example problems he draws on the board. He gives us about 5 min to answer the question before allowing us to collaborate, and discussing the answers with us.","Dr. [Removed] was showing us an example problem to work through on the board during the middle of class. She then told us to solve out the problem and gave us about 5 minutes to work through it before showing us her solution.","I can't really think of an example at the moment.","Usually, if someone makes a mistake in class or on an assignment, Dr. [Removed] will make sure they are corrected. She does not rudely correct people.","Especially in the first week of class, the professor made an effort to determine the makeup of our class and their future career goals. The majority of the class raised their hands to indicate they were in a health science major and we discussed previous courses that have been accomplished to be eligible to enroll in physics.","She will provide examples of what we are discussing in class by mentioning her research or providing examples of locations near us. For example, when talking about climate she showed us a map of [Removed] since we were all familiar with the area. Having examples in the form of photos on the slides also help tremendously.","If we are struggling he and the TA's are there to help us \n","Only very occasionally would a student raise their hand to ask a question but when they did [Removed] would take it seriously an do his best to answer it. If he didn't know the answer he would actually spend time outside of class researching it and came back with an answer.","Dr. [Removed] makes sure to give some time after talking about a new topic and asks if we have any questions every time. No matter what the question may be, she does not hesitate to answer it.","I don't really remember her ever bringing this up.","When questions are presented, he encourages us to talk to our neighbors to help find the answers. This helps a lot.","Professor stated that if there was any trouble with scheduling accommodations to email her or the TA to resolve the issue.","Professor [Removed] makes sure to send out links to opportunities for students to receive tutoring or help. He also has the TAs hold test reviews when appropriate","During class time he would ask us to elaborate on each others ideas","We have pair / group discussions daily on questions asked during lecture. \n","Told the students to talk to him if anything is inhibiting their focus. Just provided us resources to improve our wellbeing.","We work on questions together every single class","Dr. [Removed] has us do [Removed] instapolls to actively learn in class and allows us to collaborate with our peers.","He just talks about the research he is doing now and what he did previously. It's nice to hear someone be excited about what they're doing knowing that this is a cool and achievable application to what I am learning.","There were times during the end of the lectures where the professor brought real life chemicals to experiment and show us the result of what she was teaching. \n","Every so often our instructor does check ins with the class. In this exercise, we are asked to reflect on our different values, identify them, and explain. These are written anonymously so that students are comfortable enough to be completely honest in their responses.","I think she posted an announcement about it","My professor has asked us once or twice to discuss icebreaker questions. I believe one of them was sharing how we chose our major. I got to share with my neighbors and I always love hearing other peoples stories. This happened at a bit of a random point in class, kind of like a brain break which I actually enjoyed. It would be nice to have a 5 minute break to talk to my peers in the middle of class each day.","The chemistry can be applicable to almost anything and this is seen when we do relevant experiments / demos during class. This happened two weeks ago and a demo is almost monthly.","Everyday we share practice question answers","By describing how getting into [Removed] has shown how far we've already gotten","In our squarecaps, which are brief quizzes given at the end of each class, we are given about 10 questions we must answer, and many of the times these questions do include some sort of scientific data or mathematical model we are supposed to analyze. The data or model will be discussed when the professor goes over the quiz questions at the end of class.","The professor explained all assignments in depth and provided notes and instructions","Dr. [Removed] often tells us in class if we ever need help or assistance to email her or visit her during her office hours. She informs us this very often.","The instructor told us that for the learning modules, we could turn them in late so long as they are turned in before the exam. The instructor communicated that exams could only be missed during extenuated circumstances.","Last Wednesday, Dr. [Removed] gave us places where they have physics research programs. He talked about scientists who did research and encouraged us to research on what we like.","Through extensive teamwork in the lab, students are encouraged to learn from one another. Doing experiments together is encouraging for real world commitment.","The professor would mention the course switch if needed for certain students. She made it clear that we did not have to and it was only if we needed it. This happened a few times throughout the semester.","I do think that the instructor meets students lots of time because she always encourage students to come to the office hours.","I don't remember the last time the professor offered me material that went over the prerequisite knowledge needed for this class.","Our instructor has constantly with each thing she presents how it can affect and be understood differently to people with different backgrounds. She presents biology examples that represent so much culture and diversity.","Collaborated with big research institutions like [Removed] [Removed].","The instructor has asked an open ended question through kahoot but then given multiple choice answers for the class to answer as a poll and get results of the statistics of the class in that question. After seeking the chosen answers, he asks some people about why they chose a specific response and to elaborate on it.","I know in class we've done surveys about like relationship status, and things like that in the class.","Dr. [Removed] didn't specifically say this, but she did randomly assign everyone into small groups and always makes sure to call on every group. She is very open and wants everyone in the class to learn and participate. I do consider this to be seeking out and drawing value from a large variety of perspectives, even though she didn't say those words specifically.","Dr. [Removed] has made it clear that he will work with you to salvage your grade if you are going through something significantly incapacitating. I can't think of a particular time I experienced this, but he has told the class since the first day","Dr. [Removed] may hear 2 different perspectives of students, that at times might be right, and in those situations highlights how both perspectives work.","said working with peers is good so you have different approaches","I can not remember if this happened.","On the class before the test, the professor would go over questions that are most missed from past years, or go over which topic were the hardest.","Dr. [Removed] is truly one of if not the most caring professor I have had the pleasure to be a student for at [Removed]. She is the only professor who reaches out with mental health services and genuinely cares about our wellbeing ( the announcement she sends out are very thoughtful ).","The instructor provides and advertises office hours in class and on the canvas page. The instructor states that she is there to help the students if anyone needs any learning support.","[Removed] [Removed] does a great job reviewing our lab before we begin each day. She overviews with a [Removed], and then explains hands on. She pauses after each procedure to see if anyone has any questions. She is also available to help and answer questions once we have begun the lab.","There are textbook questions that we do for homework that reflect this.","On [Removed] discussion students are able to post any questions they have about the material or how the course is structured. The professor and TAs respond and it's another resource to help prepare for exams and quizzes","During each lecture, the professor pauses frequently to give us opportunities to think and talk amongst ourselves about the content. This helps us make inferences and piece together the information independently rather than passively listen to her talk.","After every test, Dr. [Removed] releases a form for us to fill out on what he could work on for the next unit. Since then, he has slightly added things to help us in the class, such as more practice problems.","Has not happened to me personally, but professor seems to generally convey empathy and flexibility","During a class session after the first exam, the professor celebrated the class's performance, highlighting how most students had done well and were on track to succeed in the course. This happened when we were discussing the results of the exam and planning ahead for the next topics. The professor said, \" I'm really pleased with how well you all did on the exam. Your hard work is paying off, and if you continue at this pace, you're all on track to do great in the course! \"","After our exam she congratulated us on doing well and getting our first week of exams over with. It is a big deal to finally transition fully into college so she celebrated us for it","Professor has discussed avaliability of on - campus resources","Dr. [Removed] would announce a variety of resources to aid in our prerequisite knowledge by reminding us of readiness modules we can look back over in need of a refresher. She would announce these modules over canvas announcements and in class.","The [Removed] questions, mostly the conceptual ones, often have us logic our way through aspects of equations of natural laws. This is sometimes helpful, but I think would be much more valuable AFTER we've learned a topic.","[Removed] explains concept at the start of the class \n","The instructor gives us a curve for the exam which helps with mistakes and takes off some pressure off the grades.","She talked about failure throughout her career.","The [Removed] links for each lecture","n / a","[Removed] asked to come to TA office hours, her office hours, and went to tutorials. This advice helped me understand better.","Our instructor would post Learning Modules every week that is designed in a flipped classroom style so we can learn the content first then go into lecture. She has posted numerous study materials such as videos, study guides, practice tests, types of questions, review notes, etc. to help us study for the exam because she wants us to pass the class","Ask to communicate about what we think","She constantly stresses the importance of statistics and proper application of statistics. Last class ( 09/20 ) she mentioned how it would be unethical to remove data from a visualization if that data doesn't meet your expectation / would change your interpretation of the hypothesis.","Let us know about our resources at the university.","The instructor asked the class to say what they got as an answer to a practice problem today. He gave us time to solve the problem with our classmates sitting next to us then gathered everyone's attention to ask for volunteers to say their answer. Then, he solved the question to allow us to get the correct answer on the poll.","She talked about how she decided to minor in biology later in her college experience and how we could do the same thing if we end up changing our minds. Made sure we knew that that was perfectly okay.","This occures when she does active learning and ask about our day and tells us to talk about it with our neighbor. This could be what we did for the weekened, how good the weather is, or how we're feeling.","He provides students with one on one help if you stay after class, [Removed] will make sure that every student who has a question will get their question answered, tihs happens everyday after [Removed].","It mostly happens in things like announcements and the notes in the grades. But they have notes about what you did wrong which is nice.","cool","the professor talked about her own experiences and struggles and talked about how she wants everyone to feel comfortable with expressing feelings","We are split up into groups in the class who we work with the majority of the semester. It encourages participation and provides a built - in system for studying and learning concepts better in a collaborative way.","She linked an entire canvas page that has information about useful skills for the course and [Removed] background to be successful in the class. She has office hours and the discussion sections are an appropriate size to where talking with the TA is easy","I think she addressed this in the beginning of the course and told us about where we can find resources to help us.","He starts his class everyday with a real life science / moon related example","I read the sentence wrong and I don't think it has ever been “ clearly ” stated.","Dr. [Removed] shared resources about the mental health department at [Removed] the beginning of the school year.","The professor would often maybe spend too much time trying to answer a students questions. This shows she cares a lot about her students. This would happen frequently throughout the semester.","She asks us all of the time to talk bout what we think the answer is to questions in class. It is useful because it allows us to bounce ideas off of each other in order to get the question right.","using homeworks and test retakes.","shares alot about [Removed] which he seems to be very passionate about","In slides","She is always telling us about her own experiences and any failures that she has overcome to encourage us to continue, even when we want to quit.","The instructor was very helpful in teaching me a problem. This happened last week. He said to take a different approach to things.","In almost every announcement that the professor sends she will include links to resources offered by the university, for example, the mental health resources offered by the university.","She mentions future biology courses ( like evolution or ecology ) and how that contributes to our development as scientists / thinking scientifically.","Shared about her niece's music, and her time studying in [Removed]. This happened over the past couple of weeks. It showed he commitment to learning, and also the effort she is willing to put forth to support others, even in situations not seemingly applicable.","They always ask how our week has been going during class!","We were discussing what the best way to collect data was and she mentioned how important feedback for the course is. This happened a couple months ago when we were talking about ways to collect data.","We have many insta polls during class that keeps everyone engaged and answering questions, some are open ended and some are multiple choice","I think the professor is willing to work with students who have accomodations and is very understanding.","At the start of the semester in the first few lecture periods, students were asked to share personal information with their neighbor. This was in an attempt to help students to make friends in the class and get to know each other.","Dr. [Removed] always encourages students to attend office hours to ask questions about concepts or homework problems. Students can come and get all their concerns addressed.","Our class uses [Removed] instapoll to answer questions asked during lecture almost every class. She opens the instapoll and encourages us to try our best to answer it with the knowledge that we have worked on during lecture.","My instructor often asks us to engage with our peers in proximity. It allows us to improve and solidify our knowledge.","Each lecture includes examples from the real world that we use to practice the concepts learned in that class.","Professor always tells us our future is never in jeopardy if we are struggling currently. She implies that past experiences have gotten us to where we are and as long as we keep working we can do anything, especially doing well in the course too.","My professor performs class instapolls in which we work independently before he explains how to get to the correct answer. He does this for every class.","I was reminded of when we get to rate our professor's at the end of the semester. The instructor takes this feedback into consideration when teaching.","By including realistic examples, my instructor is able to explain the relevance of physics in our everyday life / current events.","We have a lot of formulas we use and the instructor will often ask us what certain components stand for and how to derive formulas to solve for what we want.","She will ask us questions and some students will raise their hand and answer / explain if they are able to.","The class provides review sections outside of class to ask advanced questions. The physics textbook provided also has concepts that are beyond the class.","She assigned us into teams with other classmates in our class so that we could meet people and feel comfortable discussing during class. She encourages us to talk with each other and work with each other.","[Removed] the professor will present a question to the class, and then asks other students what they think about the answer a student gave.","Dr. [Removed] provides additional online textbook resources on her [Removed] page that have in depth discussions about topics in lectures. This allows students to prepare for [Removed] 302 and beyond, preparing them for success.","Dr. [Removed] split us up into small groups, which facilitates discussion in general. Besides that, she also has held in - class activities, like when we were speaking about nondisjunction in meiosis, where she had us model meiosis with pipe cleaners. It really helped because she created an environment where she expects us to discuss and collaborate with each other.","We would go over a topic, and then she would give us a practice problem about the topic. She would tell us to work together to solve the question and give us about 5 minutes before reviewing the answer with the whole class \n","She always asks if there are questions before changing slides during lecture","My professor tells us to collaborate with each other during class. She actively encourages us to form study groups and discussions facilitate this encouragement.","She will show extra videos or something like that to give us extra knowledge","When going over a practice problem, the professor wrote out what would intuitively be the correct answer. This answer, however, was incorrect and she explained the principle that made it incorrect and what made a different answer choice correct. She warned us to not make this mistake on the exam.","Day after the test the instructor stated that the grades were good and the test grade doesn't define how you will do in the class.","Dr. [Removed] helped me find a private tutor for [Removed]. The tutor will help me go over the lectures, complete any quizzes or any homework I'm struggling with. Professors should help students find private tutors for their classes if they need one to help promote positive learning in their classes.","She asks students to voice concerns in class. She then goes over them at the end.","Amazing course wish [Removed] would provide more courses like this.","The whole course is based off of the antibiotic resistance crisis which is a current problem that is getting worse in our world. This is discussed daily in our class since we are working to discover antibiotics that kill diseases.","We participate in group projects, known as ecology notes, which we are provided in our discussion sessions. In these projects, we work with group mates to apply the ecological concepts and models to real - world issues. For example, in our most recent ecology note, we applied [Removed] richness and abundance models and worked together to finish the assignment.","Whenever we would be doing an active learning exercise, we would have to talk about it with the people around us. After that, we would go over it, and she would always ask if anyone had any trouble with the material.","Our instructor emphasizes that we speak up and answer questions based on our knowledge and opinions which creates an atmosphere of exchanging knowledge for the growth of individuals. We do this every week and in exchange we have made friendships with the people around.","I can not say I can for sure reference a specific moment, but Dr. [Removed] is very mindful of our interests and tries to relate difficult concepts to something more simple that we may enjoy and may make this topic easier to understand. She has done this several times. This happens throughout her lectures.","Every week we have a content question assignment where we specifically ask questions about the lectures from the week. These questions are then answered during the next weeks lectures to clarify the concerns from the following week.","In class there have been many students that have expressed concern when it comes to learning the material.","He has us use outside knowledge to apply to practice problems but guides us through it \n","When it was time for the first midterm, Dr. [Removed] said \" I had bad tests throughout my career, but it always   works out. \"","Implied in the course based on our majors and interests.","They kind of just brushed on it, mentioning how this material may be useful in the medical field or if students are pursuing the physics path, the things we are learning will be beneficial.","My instructor used examples from her personal life to give us guidance","Before she answers the practice problem she asks us to try ourselves first.","When the bacteria dilutions in my group were not usable the instructor allowed us to redo the dilutions and we eventually were able to catch up with the rest of the class.","She has provided various resources such as the university lecture videos from Dr. [Removed], which are very helpful when trying to understand topics that you might be confused on.","Whenever we are working on practice problems after Dr. [Removed] talks about a topic, we are encouraged to talk with others to get the idea to sink in.","She would talk about the different people who have impacted chemistry and how they have.","There was an application of scientific experiments where Dr. [Removed] would provide historical context. Such as the [Removed] experiment being limited to their technological in that historic time or how the understanding of physics was different in the past compared to today.","Our instructor had us review research posters as a group and then later come together as a class to go over our thoughts. She gave enough time for us to collect our thoughts on the research poster before asking us to share it to everyone else.","She always has encouraged us to take a break and make sure not to make us stress over content in class. She never tells us we can't do it because of our past experiences.","Everyday","Can't remember a specific moment \n","This occurred during a lesson on chemical reactions, where the instructor pointed out that some students may have learned the material in earlier grades while others were encountering it for the first time. The instructor said, \" We all come from different educational experiences — some of you might already be familiar with these concepts, while others might be learning them for the first time. \"","We sit in groups for lecture, so every lecture we discuss questions with a few other people.","Our instructor finds it important that we study together and make a point to communicate outside of class","I know that Dr. [Removed] has additional resources posted on his canvas page for any of his students that need to reach out and explain if they are going through significant life challenges. I always see him talking to students after class and he spends that   time answering their questions and posting resourceful information on [Removed] discussion. I have not personally asked him for additional support, but I would feel confident and comfortable approaching him or any of the TAs if I needed to.","My professor told us that there are office hours and discussion sections if we need extra help in the course.","Ask students to do intsapoll. Relates the topics to real life.","Topic was being discussed and application of what was being discussed was being used, then to understand the concept further, the instructor would start a poll. I believe it was a method to doing attendance and collaboration with other students but would last about 5 minutes. After the poll ended, we would discuss as a class how to determine the right answer and usually transitioned into the next area of learning.","One day in the lab when we rated poster projects, one student from each table was allowed to share their ideas on why they had such a rating for a particular poster. It was encouraged that other students from each table to voice their thoughts.","We have been talking about our outside interests within our table and she has come to provide input to the conversation. This happened during the early portion of the lab.","We were always reccomended and encouraged to attend office hours","On the first day 8/26, we were asked to share with a peer something that we are good at.","After Quiz 1 where said we needed to learn and improve our learning strategies to master the material in order to do better if we felt that our score was not good.","Since we are taking genetics, we are learning about different diseases and how they are inherited. In this way, it's important to understand certain pedigrees and predispositions for diseases. This comes from a background of different research.","she provides many resources in canvas so that we have plenty of ways to stay up to date with the class and with all the material.","We had a slide show that talked about the resources on campus and a slide was dedicated to mental health resources. This happened about two or three weeks ago.","She describes how science was not always structured and defined this way and how scientists like [Removed] had to operate under very little knowledge and different structures.","I had to get the time I took my test due to accommodations moved and he was very accommodating and allowed me to take the test at a different time.","She encourages us to go to office hours and will tell us to form study groups.","Dr sata goes through the questions on square cap every class and answers every questions that is posted on there and makes it a more detailed explinaition if the students need it","During the lectures my professor teaches us the lecture for the day but while she is she stops and has us do a poll sometimes for checking our understanding. We use [Removed] insta poll to do questions that are sometimes open ended or [Removed]. This is done either during class or after.","Every lab when [Removed] explains the procedure she talks through things that have gone in the past and how to avoid them. Example, puncturing agar and using less pressure.","Extra textbooks and links are provided in exam preparation and in relation to the question types and learning modules","Dr. [Removed] encourages us to ask questions","We work in lab groups. Our instructor emphasizes that we have to work together as a group to have the best outcomes. This occurred during lab.","I can not recall a specific experience with the instructor, but she is very friendly in office hours and has shared anecdotes about her personal life.","We would be told to ask questions in the ed threads in canvas or go to office hours with a TA to understand anything we're struggling on.","The class is organized into groups, and we always work in our groups at the end of class when doing the course pack problems. This happens EVERY class. ( 2x / week )","We have Instapolls which are either multiple - choice or open - ended.","Throughout the semester, our instructor encouraged us to ask questions if we were confused over any of the procedures or concepts taught in the lectures. She would then help us out with any issues we were facing.","I only remember her talking about this during the first few weeks.","My professor always allows us to work on worksheets in the middle of lectures or towards the end, so we can apply what we just learned.","If we don't know something, [Removed] is always helpful in explaining it to us.","Has problems in class that we discuss with peers around us.","Every class, the professor will give us time to discuss certain content or problem with our peers. During this time, we are able to ask / answer each other's questions and collaborate.","[Removed] has mentioned briefly about different paths that is possible in the realm of chemistry. Which leads to students taking interests and asking questions.","Periodically during a lecture, the instructor will pose a question about the new material and ask us to discuss our answer with a neighbor.","I remember sometime last month, Dr. [Removed] detailed how she made the change to focus much more on the growth mindset after a student was able to echo that exact sentiment.","This entirety of this course has provided me the space to share my interests and activities with fellow engineering students in and outside of the class.","The teacher talks with us professionally and with repsect during class.","We are currently learning about thermodynamics, and she helps the class understand by using real world examples such as wood burning.","She stopped the lecture to tell us that as long as we put the effort into this course, we should be able to succeed no matter how much knowledge you have. This happened during the first couple classes.","The instructor encourages us to reach out to our TA and LA when we are unhappy with a grade or confused on an assignment.","During class, [Removed] preaches the benefits of active learning as opposed to passive learning since it conditions you to receive data from your memory. She facilitates active memory practice by providing copious practice questions.","When we do our instapolls we sometimes get the opportunity to work alongside our classmates. We share our ideas and later share our findings.","Professor [Removed] is very kind to students and she respects the needs and time commitments of them as well.

This happened early in the semester, and before it began, the instructor said, \" Today is about hearing from you — what's making sense, what isn't, and how we can all learn better together. \" The session helped clarify key points and created a supportive learning environment.","The slides are designed to be trial and error. She makes sure we learn and retain new information.","It was simply just a statement at the beginning of the semester what we are all capable of learning and doing well. we then continued the class","As I mentioned before, readings for this class is often dependent on the student, as the readings could cover comprehension or unanswered questions. As of last class, Friday the 27th, the professor   reminded us of the readings and its significance.","In writing, my professor included information about seeking mental health services on campus on the course syllabus. In addition, my professor emailed us a [Removed] sheet, ensuring that students have some \" wiggle room \" to miss some class days in case they need a mental health day or a day to just get some more sleep in. The syllabus was shared before the first day of classes and the [Removed] was shared on [Removed].","While working in the lab at their other job, as well as during their time as a student.","Today's lecture consisted of a new subject and we ran out of time, and she emphasized how disturbed bond angles are going to play a big role on the next lecture.

These lectures generally build on the ideas of basic bio","Every class we have an opportunity to engage with our peers to solve whatever problem we are given. After a few minutes, she solves it.","After every topic the professor would tell the class to discuss what was explained with a neighbor.","She encouraged us to work through problems and concepts in our lecture slides with the person next to us before looking at the answer slide.","Professor [Removed] uses [Removed] [Removed] relatively often during lectures to test students' understanding of the content just covered or to gauge their opinion on something related to the class structure. She will tell the class that she's about to release an [Removed] question and give us 1 - 2 minutes to answer.","On square cap we were asked about concerns for the course. Additionally, he has office hours where we can talk to him about issues we may be having. We can also ask plenty of questions in discussion sections and in class.","She talks about how she tries to make the learning modules good for us with no invalid information.","Physics has a lot to do with gravity and Dr. [Removed] incorporates a lot of the moon landings in lecture.","When discussing sex - linked traits, Dr. [Removed] used the specific example of [Removed] to explain how sex - linked traits work through a pedigree.

This also ensures attendance.","we are encouraged to discuss questions amongst our groups first.","When when my instructor stated \" create opportunities for students to work with peers and collaboratively learn the material \" occurred during the first week of school when we reviewed the syllabus.","The syllabus posted before class began clearly outlined the criteria for missed coursework and extenuating circumstances. \n","We go through a lot of practice problems during lecture. When we work through these problems the professor will turn to areas of the room for answers to these questions.","During last week's monday lecture, she mentioned how she is content with the exam 2 scores and encouraged us in letting us know that we are almost done with the semester.","You can retake modules up to three times which is helpful to fully understand what your learning, and you can retake one test.","Before Dr. [Removed] begins her lecture, she ensures we start by talking to our neighbors and talking about one good thing that has happened throughout the week. She has expressed that talking to our peers and explaining the reasoning behind our answers to class problems supports a learning environment. \n\n I can't remember the exact groups, events, or organizations that Dr. [Removed] encouraged joining, but she has reminded the class to be involved with the school at least a couple of times when she does announcements.","Our perusal assignments teach us about having various perspectives and that it is important to respect these perspectives but make sure to discuss them. These perspectives allow us to learn more.","Our professor once said that there is always room and time for change, and that everyone is capable of earning an A in her class.","-","The weekly quizzes and also extra attempts allows students to learn from mistakes. More over, it helps students utilize it during study sessions","Dr. [Removed] sends out lots of emails reminding us when assignments are due, and also provides details on her syllabus about how to make up work.","professor uses tips / tricks, lectures, online resources, in - class [Removed], etc.","My instructor once described to us the challenges she faced when she was an undergraduate student outside of the state and the ways she was able to cope with those challenges and persevere. I allowed me to get to know the TA better and understand where she comes from.","She would sometimes ask how certain students study or review in order to share tips. This did not happen often, but it still helped when she asked.","When Dr. [Removed] was doing electron configuration, she talked about how even after passing general chemistry in college, she still recommends writing out the entire configuration.","On the first day of class, Dr. [Removed] went over the syllabus and course policies, including his policies of dropping our two lowest HW grades, three lowest [Removed] grades, and offering re - tests for all three midterm exams. He's revisited / reminded us of these policies once or twice so far in the semester.","In office hours, the instructor will answer students questions which Professor [Removed] answers thoroughly to aid students and help them gain knowledge.","I think when we doing insta polls in class she ask us to share what we think is the right answer. So, usually some students speak and share with the whole class and she tells him if it's wrong or right.","Dr. [Removed] often states the importance of a growth mindset and its effect on one's learning. Furthermore, Dr. [Removed] encourages students to adopt positive study habits.","Before moving onto a new topic Dr [Removed] will show us a real world example of the up and coming information ( usually something about space or the moon ) and then he'll ask us questions. I think this is done so that we can think critically about what we already know and try to apply that and logic to delve into the next topic.","Dr. [Removed] would not answer questions in class, but she was open about her office hours and the several other opportunities to ask questions to TA's and shared her hours for Friday [Removed]. She would remind students at the end of class to come to office hours to have any questions answered and promoted the TA's academic communities in which students could ask questions and go over practice problems.","Near the beginning of the course, she told us about her experience of being an undergrad. She told us [Removed] she struggled but eventually found her groove.","The instructor frequently presents the class with practice problems of what is being taught and has students split into groups to form an answer before the instructor decides to share the correct way and answer to the problem.","She will provide different examples of current data scientists and the work that they do in different projects.","constantly makes us discuss instapools answers with classmates and work in groups","This was after the first exam. The average was low on the first exam, so the instructor told us to look over the questions we missed and prepare better on the next exam.","Alot of the example problems we have done are based on real world scenarios","Dr. [Removed] mentioned research opportunities in class. She also spoke about the class's application to the lives of pre - med students.","At the beginning of the course as we were learning about chemistry basics, she stated that our past knowledge or grade in chemistry for high school does not dictate our future success. I found this very motivating as I was very worried for college chemistry as I got a [Removed] in high school pre - Ap chemistry. It motivated me and reduced my anxiety, now I have a 100 in the course","p","She allowed us to work on a group project during the last few weeks. We met up outside of class to collaborate on the project.","The professor asked students for their opinion in instapolls on the right answer. This happened on Mondays when there are instapolls.","The instructor herself does not answer student questions but she always encourages students to ask TA's questions. I've heard that the TA's are helpful but I've never asked them a question.","Careers that use the study of genetics","On the very first day of class, the professor went over the syllabus. During the middle of the lecture, we reached the portion of the syllabus that went over the professor's late policies. She made it very clear that we understand their policies and keep them in mind if we are in a scenario that requires us to recall them.","The instructor has shown us the materials that will guarantee success at the beginning of the semester. They are all on [Removed].","The instructor mentioned how students with accommodations can take the quiz in the professor's office and will be provided extra time.","After each exam, there is not extra credit specific to the exam, but there is a large curve that helps students with a mindset of wanting to learn from these mistakes and take a challenging course without sacrificing their grade.","The professor talked about this during electron configuration and orbital theory.","This was one of the first labs, where she told us all our reserch and data mattered, whether it was giving us the results we wanted or not.","In [Removed] questions she would have us reflect on and answer these exact questions.","At the beginning of many classes, Dr. [Removed] will allot a few minutes to us discussing an ice breaker with our group. One time, we had to explain what animal we would be. Also, each of our tables came up with team names, which is funny.","Dr. [Removed] gave us practice problems for each midterm to complete throughout the semester. The more I practiced and understood the questions, the better I did each time. Her HW helps me explain material and do my own research.","She has us sit in teams during class so that we can talk about the questions that are asked during class.","Professor [Removed] is always open for a chat. When a project is due, she makes sure that we know to contact her if anything is off.","Basically we had an instapoll about what we were learning in class earlier this week. I have [Removed] and she went over the ideas that the instapoll would be over and then she tests you over the material through the instapoll. After students submit it she'll go over it.","Dr. [Removed] uses ed discussion to allow for students to provide feedback for the course and ask questions as needed. [Removed] can be answered by Dr. [Removed] or any of the TAs for the course.

Dr. [Removed] consistently reminds everyone of office hours either during lecture or through [Removed] announcements.","He's very big on the application of biology to any type of medical field. During the cell - defense lectures, he gave examples regarding the future of medicine.","yes","Dr. [Removed] uses [Removed] Discussion. On the first day, she introduced this platform and encouraged students to answer each other's questions on [Removed].","This usually happens during the [Removed] and when there are questions in the slides. Before revealing the answer, we are allowed to discuss how to solve the problem or come up with an answer with peers before the answer is revealed. After that time is up, Dr. [Removed] allows us to share our thoughts and what we think is the right answer before revealing the answer and going a bit more in depth with the topic.","He encourages students to express to the TA's and himself if something is happening and they need help, academic or not.","This occurrence followed the posting of our first midterm's results. Our professor spent some time in a following lecture going over the results, and he made a point to emphasize the differences in each student's starting point in this class. We were made to understand that not everyone is on equal footing, and that's okay.","Allows for three quiz drops of lowest grades and replacement tests","On the first day of class, Mrs. Hall told us a bit about herself including her background as a physical therapist and that her love for research and teaching brought her to the lab setting.   She also told us that her daughter is a sophomore in college which is the average age of our class.","There are clear deadlines for this course and Dr. [Removed] often reminds students of these deadlines during class. However, there is a built in 24 hour grace period that can help everyone meet the deadline.","We work in pods so it's all collaborative.","Encourages us to go to office hours.","I believe this survey in itself is an incentive from our professor to provide feedback.

It would usually happen a couple of times during each class time, to thoroughly understand what we were learning.","He's always encouraging us to work in groups. Any time someone is alone he tells them to sit next to someone to discuss.","We are given graphs sometimes that have scientific data and evidence. We are asked to dissect this data and come to a conclusion.","During lectures, the professor would connect the information presented with a real - world application. This would help students to think of other situations, allowing them to make connections to what they would like to accomplish in life.","While explaining some material concepts required for the course, he goes into the aspect of very unique important career paths with these concepts.

When that person answers, he asks another person to elaborate on that. This usually happens in every lecture.","not clear when but she did","I know that [Removed] does this because after each and every single topic, she will ask the class if they have any lingering questions about the material. When somebody asks, no question is a bad question and she treats each question with a well thought out answer","Dr. [Removed] provides her students with surveys regarding how we are experiencing the course throughout the semester.","To be entirely honest I do not remember the exact stories she quotes as this class is at 8 in the morning. I know sometimes she will relate physics examples to things she has done or things we have done. For example, we did a physics problem on about calculating tension force of string holding up a [Removed]'s sign. She reminisced on her first time at [Removed]'s in order to explain how she chose the problem and to be more relatable to us.","The instructor mentioned how specific content in the course can be used in a variety of fields apart from just medicine.

It is heavily emphasized that you can't become a master at anything without ever doing it, and this is a course about exploration.","Dr. [Removed] is always happy to help people during office hours and often learns the names of the students who go to office hours frequently. She says you can go to office hours even if you don't need specific homework help, you can just go whenever. She also advertises other STEM events that she'll be at and encourages students to go.","sometimes to test our thinking and gauge were we are she will give an instapoll in the middle of lecture over a concept/ practice problem.","She has mentioned before about careers in data analytics and how these skills can help you if that is the path you wish to take.","During our discussion sessions, this is all we do.","Althought I am not sure if this happened, I am sure that they would do their best to accommodate for the student and help them out.","At the very beginning of the course, our professor asked us to share some goals we had for this course. We then briefly discussed what we all said, but since then, we haven't spoken about it.","Every class, we are asked to discuss problems with one another and discuss what we think. Through this, we interact with our teams and grow relationships with the people around us.","We have done at least 2 or 3 surveys on the course already, not including this one. She highly encourages them and has stated that they are very helpful. They are usually announced on canvas and during class.","She always makes sure that we know that we can go to her if we don't understand something ( and that she has cookies during office hours if we'd like ).

For instance, she would sometimes ask how students prefer to receive their lecture material or what methods they believed worked best for their learning.","The professor asks us often to share ideas with our classmates and work through problem. For example one time we were asked to draw a chemical structure and the professor encouraged us to ask our classmates and talk through any issues solving the question.","There s basically this thing called ed discussion. Within there you can answer other students questions. I believe the TA or prof will also go over it and answer questions.","The professor provide links to other resources other than the textbook that could help broaden our understanding on the topics.","The instructor provides university mental health resources on her syllabus. She overall creates a positive and supportive classroom environment.","That this course is a stepping stone for understanding things around us everyday, although most of us aren't planning to be ecologists.","My instructor has course - specific materials, which are the slideshows she uploads to [Removed] which we can go through with her. We can take the same notes she is taking on the side and have the problem in front of us without difficulty in drawing something. This happens for every lecture. She will sometimes tell us not to go ahead of her or look ahead for answers.","She told us stories about the challenges of being a woman in physics at the time she was studying and having to deal with all the judgement from her peers just because she was a woman. She told us that those experiences helped her grow and understand that the input of others does not determine her value and does not make her any less of a physicist than those men who talked down to her.","Dr. [Removed] often gives us time every class to discuss what she just talked about in the lecture with our peers. This provides us with an opportunity to learn the topic and see if we have any misunderstandings.","In her weekly Learning Modules, she gives us multiple attempts to go through it, and allows us to look at what questions we got wrong in between attempts. She also has make up tests at the end of year that students can choose to take if they scored badly on one of the previous exams during the year in order to try and get their grade up.","Dr. [Removed] mentions our futures often and suggests how physics may relate to our prospective careers.","In the middle of our lecture on November 4th, Dr. [Removed], paused and shared a personal story about a pivotal moment early in her career. She described how, as a junior researcher, she presented her work at a conference and unexpectedly faced challenging questions from the audience. Reflecting on that experience, she told us, “ I was nervous and questioned if I belonged in this field, but that moment shaped my resilience and taught me the value of preparation. ”","Currently, we are using a lot of algebra to solve our equations, so he often refers back to past material we've learned and emphasizes how everything is built off of it. It occurs on occasion but mostly when we are applying new equations that seem intimidating. He also is always talking about how we can come for help if we are struggling in the moment with the current material which will help in the future when we begin to build off of that material.","I know the professor did this, but I'm not sure how exactly he did it. He mostly encourages reflection following exams, asks us to reevaluate our preparation methods, and suggests ways to study.","I'm honestly not too sure about it but I faintly recall it happening in an educational context. I could be entirely wrong though.","Last class, I had a bit of agar hanging off my plate which had touched the [Removed] coli bacteria. I asked how I should go about removing it as I poked at it with my toothpick. Our TA strongly advised me against that and showed me how to properly remove the slimy piece.","Within the first week of school, we got into teams that allowed us to collaborate with classmates to determine answers to questions and instapolls asked during class.","The professor multiple times would remind the class that given her background as an international student her experiences were very different from ours.","Said that after our exam, it's always possible to ged a good grade in the class and this average we have in class does not reflect how it will stay in the future.","Providing study guides and textbooks readings outside of class, but I'm not sure if an was byeond the course material","Every lecture we start off with a true or false and questions to talk with our neighbors then we come together and discuss. This is usually what leads us into the topic for the day.","She mentioned that having a good understanding of the foundation will help me in my pre [Removed] classes.","Every day in class, Dr. [Removed] has the class participate in [Removed]. These [Removed] are a very small portion of our grade and directly ask questions related to content in class. After the daily polls, Dr. [Removed] explains the rationale behind each answer choice and why each one is correct.","This was said during the beginning of the term and was went to show that your prior coding knowledge did not matter, this class was intended for all levels of knowledge.","In September during our first unit, chemistry for biology, my professor provided a link to a website to explore the structures of various proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates during the lecture. My professor stated that this website would help visually with understanding how r - groups and functional groups interact with each other.","We are allowed to retake up to two of the exams at the end of the semester, but the professor still makes it known that is an expectation that we will do well on the tests so that we won't have to make them up","I don't have anything bad to say about this course.","She has specifically stated that taking this class doesn't mean you have to become a physics major. Or even continue down that path in the future. She is very good with understanding the students and what they may want.","Only happened at the very beginning of the semester as an introduction ; Dr. [Removed] introduced herself, her family, and her field of study.","As a class, we were discussing gravitational force and how it applies to our space systems. Dr. [Removed] showed us a video on the moon and the sun and the relevance of [Removed]'s gravitational pull to them.","He encourages us to learn from our mistakes. He says that he failed classes and exams in college too and was still able to be successful.","Today in class we looked at mutant distributions in germ vs somatic cells","I just remember during our first week of lab she mentioned her past and was talking about different career paths biology research can take you. She also gave details about what she has accomplished.","The professor incorporates examples and applications into the lecture materials as well as the learning modules we complete before each class. These examples usually detail how specific concepts apply to broader ideas in the real - world. While discussing chemical reactions, the professor highlighted the chemical reaction that takes place in rockets and cars.","It was frustrating to wait for other groups to proceed","She doesn't really say much about this","My TA makes sure that everyone knows what is happening. She does this by going around and asking each table their ideas about the topic.","We use mathematical models / system in every class to set up our problem. We use a free body diagram to show the forces acting on our system.","Not anything in specific situations, but Dr. [Removed] frequently emphasized that all students could succeed in the course, regardless of their background.","I don't exactly remember what was said, but she does mention how effective her office hours have been for students.","Dr. [Removed] always has squarecap open for any questions students have throughout the course. Additionally, the pre - lecture assignment requires us to ask a question or make a comment about next class's lecture so it helps you make sure you understand the material or know what you are struggling with.","This was not said during lecture. It was also not mentioned any other time.","Just this week in class, Dr. [Removed] had us draw specific [Removed] [Removed] for compounds and then analyze / interpret certain data. For example, our goal was to identify how many [Removed]'s the structure contained and what this meant for the molecular shape of the compound.","He creates [Removed], gives us time to answer, lets one person answer aloud, then reveal the correct answer.","Instapolls","In class, Dr. [Removed] is always encouraging us to ask questions and voice concerns ; through [Removed], she's always offering mental health and academic resources. Overall you can tell she is very attentive to the well being of her students!!","Dr. [Removed] releases these review notes for tests that she recommends us use to study. These review notes are specifically designed to help us on the test.","My professor encourages that we go to office hours or other extra resources should we be struggling with anything in the course.","I think she talks about her own life experience often to us so we can learn from them too.","I just think that science research can be intimidating sometimes but how they put it into parts that is easily digestible, it really makes me feel like I can do it. Not that they were really stated it, but they expect everyone to be able to complete it.","Our teacher has made several feedback surveys ( including this one ) available and has offered extra credit to fill these out. She has reminded us before they are due.","Again during the squarecap session he will go through the answers and if the majority of class got one wrong he'll go over some of the material again.","I belive there was a time when she stated we could reach out to her or the team regarding concerns related to the course. This was at the beginning of the year during introductions to the course lay out / syllabus.","He was lecturing on velocity and acceleration earlier this month. He was describing and showing us time and position graphs.","[Removed] showed us additional websites to check out that were relevant to the course. This was about two weeks ago when we began the annotated bibliography","We looked at different study methods and the science and effectiveness behind them.","we did study skills fo where we reflect on the previous exams we did so after each test we would fill out this form and think about what we could do better on the next exam","Genetics is all about the real world and how living organisms come to be around us. It applies to everything, and I think she makes that clear in her lectures!","When answering the squarecap questions, Dr. [Removed] asks the class for someone to explain the reasoning behind an answer they gave. This happens at least once a class every week.","Encouraged reaching out for academic struggles.","Dr. [Removed] equated the difficulty students had with the exam 2 problem set to the type of struggle we'll face when solving real - world problems in the future, like cancer.","some science data we need to analyze appear on the [Removed] on the class","we would go over the discussion through a powerpoint, if you needed to ask questions he had the square cap poll inputed which he would later then answer questions then have us answer 10 questions in square cap.","Instructor said we have learned a lot so far.","Our instructor encourages collaboration on our assignments which allows us to meet up with one another outside of class. In addition to this, our instructor makes ice breaker questions so we can talk about various topics like if we were an animal, what animal would we be","Our instructor have us an opportunity to gain back half points on our last physics exam by taking a joint in class exam.","Prof. [Removed] prompts this sort of discussion almost every day through in - class group activities.","Just today we had an assignment due last week and some people submitted it but it was incomplete. So she extended the deadline for us to re submit it correctly and completely and she explained exactly what we needed to do","My professor uses real world examples when explaining things and encourages others to enforce change.","We have daily instapolls relating to what we are currently learning in class. We are given time to try to solve the problem with our neighbors before the instructor goes over the question.","Dr. [Removed] often provides us opportunities to work with hands - on learning with our table mates.","Dr. [Removed] has expressed that feedback is important and that it helps improve the course. For example, multiple students asked to have the course modules posted earlier to have more time to complete them and Dr. [Removed] has done so.","In this course there was an exercise where we had an exercise where we all tried to find things in common with one another. Connection with other students is highly encouraged and pushed for.","Sends off questions to TAs","She has always stated she is available to help during office hours and through email.","I can't remember exactly when but she will point out common mistakes when calculating or using absolute value","Dr. [Removed] gives us the opportunity to provide feedback in survey like this every couple weeks or so.","Within our course, there are prerequisite modules to work on. There are also links to pages on summarizing prerequisite knowledge and different resources explaining more in depth about the prerequisites.","She has open class disucssions where we answer questions almost every class.","The unstructured has assigned rows of seats for people in groups to comfortably collaborate with. She encourages collaboration in these groups for answering polling questions, and will call upon these groups for in class problem solving.","The labs and in class activities apply to real life data and applications. These aren;t made up data sets and completely fabricated numbers.","  With the sweetest smile, Dr. [Removed] often asks all her students how she can improve the course. This happens monthly in class, and she always reiterates how our input helps her grow as a professor and a person! She truly cares, and I give her all the credit for that.","I can't remember exact moments but this professor provides an abundance amount of resources for us to use","In my [Removed] lab course this semester, the instructor emphasized the importance of seeking help early if students feel unsupported by university offices. This was mentioned during the first week of class when the instructor encouraged us to advocate for ourselves. They said something along the lines of, \" Don't hesitate to reach out to me or my LA, we're here to help y' all, \" which reinforced the idea that they would provide another layer of support beyond university office services.","Sometimes when we would go over a certain topic, our instructor would give an example of how to use the knowledge in a career. He also would sometimes have videos of technology and explain how physics was used to create it.","Dr. [Removed] explained the different experiments and researches done with the course material we were learning to be able to understand the material better. Additionally, Dr. [Removed] often gives reflection questions that allow us to reflect how the material could be incorporated in the real world.","My instructor walks through problems sometimes with the class. We do it on our own while she completes in on the projection.","Our instructor makes it clear that we should learn from our mistakes by offering exam retakes, and multiple attempts for assignments. This demonstrates that our instructor values the knowledge students gain over their grades.","Dr. [Removed] asks the class multiple times in the middle of lectures and instapolls to make sure the students were actually learning the material at hand. She purposely stops at a crucial point in the curriculum and makes sure the student completely understands the material. Moreover, she also welcomes all the students into her student hours and makes more time out of her schedule to make sure no student is left behind.","She often talks about her journey in the field and times she felt doubts in her skills.","She brought up [Removed] - [Removed] a few times. She also said that [Removed] - [Removed] was helpful in getting ahead, and touches on topics in [Removed] 2. This was when she was giving resources for [Removed].","He encouraged us to find study groups because studying together is always better than alone. This happened on the first day of class. \" I encourage you to form study groups with your peers because you can learn from one another. \"","A lot of the time, she mentions how learning this material will teach us how to approach completely different problems, even outside physics","We would","Our canvas is set up to access many different resources. We have a section build for our class recorded lectures and slides, test resources, and contacting for help. She reminds us that all those resources are there and are easily accessible.","Mainly, a lot of the questions are answered by the TAs if anyone has a question due to the large class sizes. We were currently learning about [Removed] [Removed], so there were many questions asked in regard to that topic. This happens almost every class, but the most recent time that a question was asked near me was last week mainly during practice problems. Other people in the class may have has different experiences with asking questions. My instructor usually moves on with the material after some time.","In the course, the instructor often integrated popular culture references to make the material more relatable and engaging. For instance, there was recommened podcast and youtube videos. This connection sparked lively discussions and made the scientific concepts more accessible, encouraging us to think critically about real - world applications.","Usually we have [Removed] every Monday of class, and possibly some on Wednesdays. During the middle or close to the end of class, my instructor gives us a question that relates to the materials we went over in the lecture to see if we understood the materials. My instructor will sometimes go over the question with us afterward.","The instructor posted questions to work on individually, then instructed students to discuss with the person next to them.","I am not able to recall any specific moment at the moment.","There's always a question like this in our weekly homework","She would ask us to share in class."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>instructor_id<\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>practice_id<\/th>\n      <th>practice_wording<\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"instructor_id","targets":1},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":2},{"name":"practice_id","targets":3},{"name":"practice_wording","targets":4},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":5}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

These are to check understanding and usually relate directly to what we discussed in class that day.","Before the exam, he said that we could resubmit the exams for half credit if we were to show our work through the formulated steps he provided.","Dr. [Removed] said she would work with us if we have anything personal. If we need any accommodations, we should just communicate with her and she will work something out.","At the beginning of the Monday lecture on the week of Halloween, Dr. [Removed] asked the class to turn to a neighbor and discuss what they did or how they dressed up the previous weekend in celebration of Halloween.","We will go over a topic and then she i'll provide a multiple choice multiple answer question in the topic. They are usually good practice.","Before tests he always makes sure if you have any accommodations to make sure you get them for the exama","Caudill demonstrates how mistakes can be valuable when she talks about improving after an exam. She offers two makeup exams to ensure that we can learn from our poor performance on a test and do better.","Does help sessions.","There was one activity where the instructor told us to talk about our weekend with our peers. This happened in class.","During the course he was giving a lecture about our first exam and he mentioned that we should study. If we didn't have good teachers in highschool, he recommended that the students should go to office hours, TA office hours, or CSS review sessions.","It was during a lecture before our first exam where he made sure to let us know that if we were struggling we should go to him and that if we were bad at physics or calculus in the past that doesn't dictate how well we do in the course \n","In the syllabus, the instructor stated that they would be available to discuss if life events disrupted normal life. The instructor seemed receptive to working around student issues and that in these times, work would be made flexible.","Our instructor has made it very clear about reaching out if we need help. She has also given us plenty of resources we can use if we are struggling in something.","Bahar always listens when you come up to her in class to tell her about something affecting your attendance or class performance, and works to help you out.","After quizzes, Prof. [Removed] will go over commonly missed questions","Since we are analyzing collected data, she used a survey that she asked the class to fill out. This made the class more engaging since it was data that we related to. She also asks for student responses when we work a problem in class. If the student response is incorrect, she explains why and shows examples of why it would be wrong.","I am a little confused because I thought I clicked that she does not do this. In her defense, its a ginormous class and there is not much time to dilly dally.","The professor created an academic community hour where everyone in her course could go to study with their peers and TAs. She emails us weekly about this event and encourages us to go in lecture as well.","I would say this this is less in the class, and more so in the modules. This is because when it's mentioned how much we have learned in terms of applying it to future units we also give ourself credit for making it that far.","She gives us lots of information for us to use and lots of materials, in which she tell us how many of us can learn from each other whether we are right or wrong","He talked about his first grade on a physics exam and had us guess. This was a nice moment to show us that we are not defined by a moment, but a series of choices","Most of the article's we read talk about young latino males and other males of color and the choices that have been offered to them as they think or purse their future's, a lot of the time they have not been given a lot of resources or guidance or choices when choosing to a future career. Since we discuss these topics in class, our instructor helps us make correlations between what we read in articles and ways to maybe break that cycle and realize you do have more choices than what you might have been told and to explore those.","The professor mentioned this on our syllabus day, and then informed us of his office hours to personally talk to him","He uses a platform called squarecap where students can upload questions and it gives the option for students to answe","At the first lab they said they teach no matter what you already know. They think we will do good if we try.","In my course, I don't believe my instructor has invited us to help design course materials or assignments. They've mostly followed a set curriculum without student input on the structure or content of assignments. \n","Professor [Removed] has policies listed out in the syllabus and will work with students if there are special circumstances","There's usually times to share thoughts every class with each other","She just congratulates us whenever we get done with the midterms. She reassures us that we are succeeding.","Dr. [Removed] shows us who came up with the theories that we learn in class and also connects a lot of the concepts back to the space / moon which is something he is interested in. I like that he makes those connections and teaches us how we can use what we are learning and apply it to something broader.","We had the opportunity to work in teams to demonstrate the processes of mitosis and meiosis in class. It was very helpful in that we got to learn by touching the materials and working together.","Regarding checking in with students, Dr. [Removed] sends in regular announcements filled with encouraging statements for students. They often include motivational messages, advice on maintaining health, and generally positive encouragement.","When students tried to push back the date of the exam to next week, they said that it would not be possible. They stated that you are going to face challenges in life that you can not change to your desire and you have to learn how to manage yourself. Students who put in the work to get into this university might know how to do so better than those who got in automatically, but this will help you learn for the future.","Dr. [Removed] let us view ourselves as developing experts and people who can change the world.","He hosts office hours for any questions and concerns. he cares about students' opinions on his course.","Dr. [Removed] is constantly spreading positive messages of encouragement that center personal growth, and helps provide resources for constant improvement and learning. After every exam, Dr. [Removed] praises students for their hard work and reminds them that an exam is not always representative of knowledge or self worth and that there is always opportunity for improvement.","Dr sata goes through the questions on square cap every class and answers every questions that is posted on there and makes it a more detailed explinaition if the students need it","This happened when she was explaining the compounds of molecules that could be used down the road if you were in a pre - med track. We were studying formal charge and bonding. Dr. [Removed] said \" those of y all in pre - med will see these compounds later on down the road \"","we have conversations all the time in class to get to know and learn from one another.","She would explain research that is done as of current time ( that is related to the topic ). She would relate the topics things we would experience in real - life such like weather in [Removed] or relatable examples.","Our professor asks us to share what we think the answer to the insta poll would be and this happens during every lecture. He usually asks the entire class if anyone would like to take a shot at answering this question or something along those lines.","My professor's teaching style is typically showing an example problem on the board and having people work it out with those around them.","We answer instapolls with content questions every class.","We can create a research question to work on throughout the semester to help use what we are learning to work on it.","Dr. [Removed] asked us to talk to the people around us and get to know each other. This could encompass reflecting on important personal values, goals, or relationships.","She has very positive attitude in class and constantly reminds us that we are the reason she loves teaching.","n / a","She gives us big topics / concepts we will cover that day with corresponding questions and practice examples.","It was during the first week of classes when we were just starting to get into material. She showed us advice that former student had for us from taking her class.","Dr. [Removed] has provided a plethora of resources to use for this course and explain which ones are the most useful. She has explained multiple times that trying to cram the night before the test will not work in this course.","She applauds us for our test grades even though they might not meet our own expectations. She always states there's no shame in asking questions and how her and her team are hear to support us through this course.","She provides us with a lot of resources to dig into ourselves when we are studying on our own. Sometimes these resources go beyond the course material","As I mentioned before, readings for this class is often dependent on the student, as the readings could cover comprehension or unanswered questions. As of last class, Friday the 27th, the professor   reminded us of the readings and its significance.","My professor has used countless examples from space missions to relate to physics. This has been the case for the past couple of lectures. My professor quotes words from said space mission and then relates them to physics.","During his lectures, he would constantly encourage students to come during office hours. He mentioned how he like to help students if they meet a wall.","x","We discuss the pre lecture and the pre lecture gives us time to think about the topics before coming to class so we can have the time before our questions are answered","Dr. [Removed] doesn't personally ask a few students to answer questions. She asks general questions to the whole class in which a few students choose to respond to and she acknowledges. Since the class is roughly 500 individuals, she acknowledges who ever is closest or the loudest. Through acknowledging, she repeats what they said and waits to hear an opposing opinion, if not, she solves the problem.","Not only he encouraged to work and study in groups for better results, but also mentioned to help each others in needs.","The instructor mentioned how to use academic support after the exam and encouraged us to not stress about things. She also sends out table talks that we can attend if we are feeling down and need to tune in about topics like imposter syndrome.","We do our course packet problems in groups and post on google slide.","She talks about the exams and that even though we may have struggled we can relearn the material and at the end of the course retake the test.","Office hours are good places for group studying. Students are also allowed to turn and talk to each other.","She encouraged us to look at the textbook. This happened probably two weeks ago.","Every assignment has been asked of us to review with a partner and has ensured that we can share what we think is the best way to approach a problem on the worksheet.","Mainly verbal, a student had an answer got it wrong, and then the lead instructor went through the possible reasons for getting it wrong and how to approach such a problem in the future to mitigate wrong answers.","Does this in the reflective assignments. I love Dr. [Removed].","My professor talked about how she failed an exam for the first time in graduate school but still ended up okay","I would say the instructor has linked resources for those to refer to their R learning. I think since the beginning the resources are available. I can't think of particular words.","She asked us to write a reflective paper for extra credit.","During lecture we often go through instapoll questions. After we submit them se often tells us why we got them wrong and explains the errors that we did. She often tells us why something is a misconception.","A retake is held a week after every exam, which is optional and available to all students. The instructor mentioned this multiple times beforehand and explained in detail the expectations for both the exams and the retakes. After results were posted from the exam, students had several days to ask questions in class, go to office hours, and find other resources to prepare for the retake.","We discuss how things we learn we can sue in the future and how they will benefit us.","This may be a technicality, but [Removed] allows students to resubmit answers to questions without taking off points until the third submission. The professor explained this process to students during the first portion of the term.","It is on a daily occurrence in class, as we go through the worksheets she makes sure that we understand the key concepts in order to master the material. So I wouldn't say she directly states that we need to master the material, but she makes sure the the worksheets that we have the ability to. The in class worksheets are honestly helping me accel in my skill of R - studio and reading data,","she uses instapoll throughout class. It's used like a pop quiz where random questions will be asked throughout the class","There is not much student - teacher interaction because the class size is large.","I don't recall doing this.","My TA every week would mention that her office hours are available.","She talks about the community groups she has a why they are importnant to attend so you have a support system in this class","Having a professor passionate about their work really encourages us to branch out into different fields of study. They have shared personal experiences of their own research in different fields and how it has being an meaningful experience for them and others.","What happened in the course was Dr. [Removed] gave us a question pertaining to the units material, typically she walks us through before the question. This happens once or twice every class and Dr. [Removed] gives us a few minutes to answer it on our own and then she goes through why the answer was correct or why it was incorrect.","the instructor has a recap at the beginning of class regarding models learned from last class","At the beginning of a lecture after our first assessment, Dr. [Removed] spoke to the class ( and gave us time to reflect ) on our performance on the midterm exam. She explained that \" chances will be given to earn more points if you're not happy with where you are \" and restated the resources available to us.","The instructor would poll the class in what they thought about relevant content questions. This was usually designed in a way to highlight how the real answer goes against what is expected or commonly believed. They would then explain to us the real answer and provide some justification.","The instructor waited before asking someone to answer her questions.","THe worksheets are immensely helpful. I use the worksheets for the labs and homework.","The professor encourages us every class to talk to the people around us to figure out squarecap questions. She encourages collaboration on the homework as well outside of the classroom.","On the first day of class for the semester, Dr. [Removed] asked students to introduce ourselves to our peers around us, stating our favorite hobbies and career we want to pursue in the future. I was able to learn about the hometown and major of the individuals around me.","Professor [Removed] did NOT encourage students to consider different career paths!!!! I accidentally clicked the button and I can not go back","When the professor is lecturing during class, they give us practice questions and time to solve and work with our partners. This happens during every lecture, multiple times a lecture.","During weekly seminar, lecturer provided time to fill out this survey. Lecturer said the data is used for a study about teaching.","She always shares her own life stories for motivation","In our discussion sections, she gives us time to discuss our answers before going over it as a class.","She has talked about career paths and how this field applies to other fields.","He allows midterms to be resubmitted for half credit back. This was said over and over again in class and is on the syllabus.","She mentioned academic communities as well as university resources. She showed us how to access these services as well","I'm not sure of specifics","It will help then when they face a challenge or problem","[Removed], Dr. [Removed] and [Removed] all work to promote individual knowledge and teamwork throughout the lab, which requires an understanding that we all have unique experiences and backgrounds!","Sometimes homework question go beyond the scope of our notes or he'll mention applications of this material in research and things","she mentions it in lecture and also encourages students to reach out to her","She just moves on too fast. She would explain something, give like 30 seconds for us to take in what she said and moves on.","I don't recall a specific moment.","In class he encourages us to go in depth about a particular topic","We use instapoll in class for certain question in lecture, usually around understanding of the information we went over and if any parts confused us.","In the beginning few weeks of the class Dr. [Removed] made sure that every student was aware of the office hours available at almost all times because of all the TAs and his own personal office hours. He made sure all students felt comfortable enough to attend the hours.","We were going through the slides presented in class and on one of them it had a question. The professor than asked for us to discuss in a small group or pairs. This happened last week during class.","In this course, the instructor regularly reminded students of the mental health resources available, especially during high - stress times, such as midterms and finals. For example, a week before exams, the instructor emailed us with encouragement, adding, “ Remember, your mental well - being is just as important as your academic success. ” They also included links to campus mental health services and suggested we reach out if we felt overwhelmed. These gestures helped normalize seeking support and provided timely reminders when we needed them most.","She allows students to discuss a question or problem in pairs or in small groups many times during class especially after teaching a topic.","Explains everything in detail regardless of how advanced / knowledgable students are so that everyone may follow along and does not discriminate with questions.","Every week before week starts, our instructor provides an announcement with lectures and experts who do very interesting and relevant lectures to this course and tells us about this for anyone who would want to attend and/or know of it. She also mentions what happened at some of the lecture briefly at times during class.","When my teacher mentioned encountering difficult life challenges or additional support, I assumed she was referring to the need for mental health breaks or tutoring. This happened right after our first exam where people may have felt overwhelmed.","Our instructor provides examples of current event news and research that is related to the topic we are studying each week. Sometimes we go over it briefly, but all in all it is always listed in our class canvas page.","We are in small discussion groups where she makes us collaborate and answer questions in which we may be called on daily.","The instructor mentioned accommodations in the syllabus during the first week of classes.","Dr. [Removed] understands that many of her students are pre - med. She often expresses how the material we are learning will help us on the [Removed] and as a physician. Additionally, sometimes she will give us physics questions that we answer by a show of hands. She will then ask us to defend our answer, and she expresses how being able to defend what you believe or explain things to someone is important for our careers.","The professor posted student feedback on canvas. He took into account what students were saying and evaluated exam question and determined that the question was not fair and gave credit.","In this course they allow us to retake an exam we didn't do well on. This happens after the fact of the exam.","Extra vector practice problems and review exam 2 questions were given before exam 2 and the instructor posted them on quest and told us in class","In this course we just sit and do little fun ice breakers and get to know each other","To go to somewhere on [Removed] multiple times before exam time/","Today we covered temperature and energy in how it relates to ecology. During the class we were asked a question that flowed directly from the slides and were asked to answer by raising our hands to indicate our thoughts.","I think this happened very early on in the course. Our instructor talked about how the research aspect of this lab offers valuable practice and skills if you will pursue research in the future.","The professor gave clear instructions for how the students should work together.","we don't have material. just with campus resources and making sure everyone's on the same page about registration, advising / counselling, etc","In - class polls demonstrate this. We are reminded that they could feel or ask a different question that we did not initially think about. Specifically, \" Ask your partner's question. \"","He is always talking about the moon or what s in space in general. How it is where we found our laws of physics.","The instructor gives \" learning objectives \" that we can relate the lectures to, and these same objectives are the ones we can expect to see on exams","After before statistics labs happen the TAs and Professor during lecture and lab hours directly mention what is expected of each group and how group members should interact with one another to keep each other accountable for the lab.","He said that even though people had not so pleasant experiences with physics in the past, they can still succeed.","There are [Removed] sessions during every class period in which Dr. [Removed] tests our knowledge over the material taught that day. He reveals the right answers and explains them after the polls are finished.","Dr. [Removed] has within her syllabus resources for any type of emergency that can affect your academics. I personally have needed to use them and Dr. [Removed] was able to help me when these events took place.","She told us in class that she was collecting feedback and she didn't get all her questions answered so she even gave us another chance to give her feedback on the course.","I have not witnessed this. I don't deem it necessary for my learning.","During lectures, sometimes my instructor informs us about additional websites that relate to the physics problems we do in class. Today, he told us to check a website if we were interested in learning more about that topic specifically.","Dr. [Removed] has stated several times how important this survey not just for her but for future students who signs up for this course. This survey is one opportunity she has provided us to provide feedback about the course and her. She would talk a lot about how much she has grown through these survey, so it is crucial for us to provide any feedback we can. She has stated that she wants to improve as a professor.","She offered many sources and also many examples to learn and understand before like giving us a book to read or we can look into.","This is constantly occurring when we do practice problems, using specific grams and calculating what's necessary. We do practice problems a lot in class, which would tie into doing real - world problems or applications during lectures in this course. The instructor is really good at giving us time to solve this problem first and then going over it with us clearing up anything we did not understand.","The professor encourages us to use his office hours.","Especially whenever we have just moved into a new unit, Dr. [Removed] talked about how we can use our prior knowledge to help us, and if we learned something a different way in high school that works for us then we are welcome to use that method. After the first test, she repeatedly congratulated us for doing so well.","He didn't really describe challenges that are unique to different students, but rather challenges that are common barriers to the college experience : sleep, food, exercising, etc. This was a reflection assignment and he's mentioned it multiple times during different classes ; he seems to understand that around the middle of the fall, students start to get tired.","This happened in an activity in class that helped get to know our peers.","The instructor requries students to extend or apply knowledge to situations not yet covered in the course by doing pre labs outside of lab to have a deeper understanding of the hand on experiements. In addition, we also apply knowledge such as not procrastinating to ensure we get everything turned in on time.","I remember professor [Removed] addressing this type of situation in the beginning of the semester, possibly on Syllabus day.","There's time to talk with each other over provided problems in class.","Instalpolls every class and questions from the [Removed] studio worksheet \n","After taking the exam, she went through the commonly missed questions and gave a through explanation for all of them. This was helpful review to grasp the concepts.","During our instapolls, hw, worksheets and tests, we go over the answers in order to understand what went wrong in our thinking and to understand what can be done better next time.","Yes, the professor talks about positive mind set and how we should be hopeful for our improvement and use the meothids in the class to improve.","Every time we reach a section during her lecture, she would have [Removed] questions over materials she had just went over in class. Then, students would be given an opportunity to talk about the questions and responses with their group members.","We have gone over [Removed]'s laws and have worked on many physics problems going through different equations.","At the end of every slide, she always asks if we understand. If we don't understand, she addresses questions before moving on.","During office hours, the instructor mentioned that she has engaged in physics problems where the initial answer was not readily apparent ; however, after following a methodology and deeply thinking about the problem, she was successful in the end. This was immensely relatable as a student because of the many problems I similarly encounter and can not answer initially.","[Removed] has told us some good resources to study or find prerequisite knowledge and helps us understand these concepts if we still don't understand.","One time, the instructor shared a personal story about how he didn't perform well on his first college exam but eventually developed better study strategies over time. He emphasized that our current knowledge reflects past experiences but doesn't determine our future potential. Afterward, he reminded us that we, too, can improve by learning from mistakes and offered the opportunity to redo exams for half credit on wrong answers, reinforcing that growth is always possible with effort and reflection.","I believe this survey in itself is an incentive from our professor to provide feedback. We are given extra credit for doing these and it calls us to consider what we do in class.","Since we are collaborating with [Removed] [Removed], we are often reminded of how our research has real world impacts. Every soil isolate collected is logged into a database to get one step closer to finding new antibiotics.","She was introducing us to the course at the beginning of the year. One of the first things she brought up was the importance of accessing mental health services when life is a feeling out of control.","This survey that I am filling out right now is the first opportunity we have been given to give our feedback on the course. Given how comprehensive this survey is, it should cover “ various aspects of the course “.","Dr. [Removed] always emphasizes that it is okay to make mistakes and if we are making mistakes, then that means that we are truly learning. She ensures that everyone feels comfortable and even says to \" take it one day at a time \" at the end of all of her emails, which makes me feel more motivated.","We sit in groups based on our discussion section so we can make connections with our peers","The instructor encourages us to talk to our neighbors in class for questions and instapoll. The teaching team also provides us with the opportunity to work with others during discussion section, which happens every week.","They asked everyone what they thought of a particular electronic geometry. Only one person answered. She then corrected them.","Given that this is such a big class, I think it's moreso given to us in the syllabus and in his general teaching philosophy that we can approach him ourselves if a life circumstance comes up, and reliably get additional support.","Instructor consistently if we are ready to move on to the next topic and ask if we have any questions","[Removed]","I can name many times in the past few weeks when Professor [Removed] took time to answer students' questions about the material thoroughly. Normally, when a student asks a question she will go over the material in another form or a more clear example to ensure comprehension.","My instructor made it very clear that she is aware we come from various academic backgrounds but that we all belong in the class. she said this at the start of the course. She used affirming words indicating that we all belong, and if we do struggle she has numerous resources for us to use in order to succeed. She also has recently mentioned that even through using the resources and the office hour help, if you are still struggling, there is an alternative class route you can take.","she s fine","In the class he has said that he values our opinions and likes to get feedback to see how he can improve. This happens every so often when we have an assignment for feedback.","He encourages us to participate in class by raising hand, he asks us about our interests and opinions consistently","During every lecture, the professor would include practice problems on the lecture slides that we work through as a class after our independent thinking times. For example, the professor would then ask the students to determine how many valence electrons are in a specific chemical formula and ask us to explain why.","Daily instapolls are used in class to check for student understanding.","Through the TA, they always asked us like how was the lecture and it leads to us explaining how we learned in the lecture. So we kind of give them feedback about the session / lecture.","The [Removed] page for the class has a lot of this material, and the instructor reminds us of this frequently.","There are learning modules for this but I believe that they are hard to follow. it is just not the way I learn.","The instructor sets aside a lot of time in class where we practice the types of problems we'll see on tests, quizzes, etc. We're always given time to look at the problems on our own and/or with our peers, before the instructor shows us herself.","At the beginning of class, she always has a growth mindset and emphasizes for us to reach out if her way of teaching or explanation isn't sufficient.","We were going over the [Removed] [Removed] in class, and our professor mentioned that this is something we might have touched on in high school chemistry. However, she also mentioned that regardless, there will be some new information and that we are delving deeper into the topic.","Each assignment on [Removed] has a set due date and a rubric outlining how many points will be lost if submitted late. There is also information over this in the class syllabus.","Made sure everyone had completed the chemistry readiness assessment during the first week. The modules in this assessment were very helpful.","Everyday before my professor begins her lecture, she asks all of us what is something fun that we did in the past week. It won't even need to be something that we ourselves find interesting but just something that we would like to share with her.","I can't name any specific times, but anytime anyone asked a question, she would take plenty of time to answer the student's question. She would also take the topic to a deeper level and apply it to other themes of chemistry or to real life, and she would make sure her response was clear to the student before moving on.","The professor consistently introduces advanced ideas and where we can learn more about these said topics in his lectures.","The instructor basically just said to reach out if we needed help in anything, I can't remember exactly when, but it was definitely at the beginning of the semester.","During the semester, the instructor would ask for how everyone is feeling about concepts. This was done through instapoll.","She usually asks how we felt about certain things but I haven't seen her ask about future classes.","We are always reminded of all resources that are provided for us in canvas. We are often encouraged to do the practice problems provided in the lectures and in canvas.","The professor assigned us to reflect on a growth mindset based on what we can / cannot control and how we can use this to improve in physics.","Dr. [Removed] highlighted all of the resources that would be applicable and helpful to us in the beginning of the semester, and she continues to have links readily available to all of her students. She additionally sends out weekly reminders on mental health awareness and encourages positive study habits.","Every week he provides homework assignments that look very similar to the exams, so if you can succeed and practice with those, you can do well.","Well we worked in lab groups so she always encouraged us to work with them and learn from eachother","In class, the instructor gives us some time to discuss the answer with our friends which we may make mistakes but after she explains the answer, we then truly understand the concept. Also, through homework, by giving us learning module and the chance of resubmitting, we can learn what mistakes we made and fix those.","The instructor asked a student to share their answer after working on a problem during lecture. The instructor then further explained the concept and went over the answer after the student guided the instructor to get the answer.","For test monitoring, we have to use [Removed] and when people using ipads were having trouble using the software on their devices, the professor worked in an efficient manner to resolve this issue. She postponed using the software and created an assignment to help this issue. We are finally starting to use the platform again but she offered help for ipad users.","i don't remember","The course is very easy to follow, and the instructor makes very clear, what to expect for exams and quizzes.","Simply, [Removed] requested that everyone complete this survey so she has a better idea of how best to teach the class. She mentioned tweaking the class in the past based off these very surveys.","after an exam, we have an [Removed] [Removed] Activities assignment to review the questions we missed on the exam and will be graded. also, during [Removed] sessions professor [Removed] will explain mistakes and let us change answers if a majority of students missed it","Each week we have discussion sections where we spend the whole time working in groups to complete a worksheet.","Dr. [Removed] usually gives us a few minutes to answer the instapolls, allowing us time to reflect on our responses. Afterward, she explains the correct answer.","Dr. [Removed] encourages us as students to talk to our neighbors daily in class. Eventually, you feel comfortable enough to discuss things outside of class. In fact, I have made a close friend through Dr. [Removed]'s class.","My instructor has made our class a safe space, but since it is chemistry and more objective of a class nothing has been stated explicity","Dr [Removed] celebrates the scores on the midterm after the grades were released.","When I asked my professor for help on how to approach the homeworks and how to study he tole me to go through reading my textbook and if i had any questions to go and ask the TA or LA for help. I believe that he thoroughly explained how to use class material provided to me.","This is available on [Removed] homeworks.","The professor has said that students need to communicate before hand if they know something is coming up. Or, if incase of emergency to email the professor or TAs.","Before the exam and the exam retake, Dr. [Removed] will talk about missed questions on the exams and what might have tripped students up. She will also give advice on what to do to make sure you improve your score for the retake.","In this course it is easy to get confused when working on something for the first time. The instructors do a good job of pausing and letting the students ask questions.","I was able to fill out a [Removed] survey to describe my experience in the class. This occurred right now.","She often splits us into lab groups to attack certain problems.","The professor has encouraged the students to complete a course evaluation survey. After each quiz, there is a \" quiz reflection, \" survey where students reflect on their performance on the quiz and provide feedback about the course.","After our first chem test of the semester, my professor stressed how important it is for students to have learning strategies that are effective for them in order to succeed in the class. She explained the importance of utilizing practice problems, studying ahead of time, and reviewing material that is difficult more often.","This hasn't happened and is not allowed according to the syllabus","She talks through the errors student make after the test, but not prior to the test","She always tells us about the online resource hub. She advises us to look through it and practice to know the material for the test.","The practices we do in lab are explained by [Removed] and told about their significance in history and now.","Dr. [Removed] would encourage students to attend her office hours if they needed extra practice on topics. She also would tell her students other resources that would prepare them for an exam.","After exam 3, the professor asked for students who are struggling in the course to reach out to see how the team could help them.","He tends to allow us time to discuss the material or a problem and pose questions or thoughts to him before he goes through the example.","During class before our third exam, Dr. [Removed] mentioned that she reviewed with students during office hours before the past exam and was successful in covering a lot of content. She then promoted her new office hours that she would host before the third exam in order to do an exam review, and then she promoted the academic communities that are led by TA's afterwards. This showed us that she enjoyed speaking to us and reviewing in order to help us succeed.","This course allows us to retake 2 exams and a lot of extra credit. This happens at the end of the course after all the exams.","He asks us how much of our success is based on our own actions. He also made us reflect on this question and see what is in and out of our control.","In [Removed] 301, Dr. [Removed] regularly encouraged us to explore advanced topics by providing a curated list of resources related to our current unit, including articles, videos, and online simulations. This usually happened after major lectures, where he would say, “ If you're interested in diving deeper, check out these resources ; they'll give you a broader perspective on today's material. ” These recommendations not only enriched our understanding but also inspired many of us to pursue independent projects beyond the standard curriculum. \n","Over summer we had to pass a pre req test in order to be able to take this class. During the first week and recently Dr. [Removed] uploaded the modules that helped study and learn the pre req. she said that they were uploaded to the module part of canvas","My professor this week asked us to discuss understanding the energetic processes of melting water at room temperature. She first posed the question and then asked for our opinion and to make sense of it with the person next to us. This led to me discussing the question with my partner and supporting one another with our explanations.","This often occurs when we do our exam analysis sheet after an exam. We see what questions we got wrong, analyze why we got them wrong, analyze our study methods, and ponder whether we should do something differently.","she would explode balloons","The professor has mentioned how what we are learning is important and how it will benefit our future. This happens sometimes when we apply real examples into chemistry.","Explained the difference certain individuals within chemistrys past have come up in and how that may affect their viewpoints and those viewpoints may or may not reflect current student viewpoints.","The instructor lets the students ask questions about the class, or even just clarification for certain thing on the [Removed] Discussion, where the TA's or the professor responds.","The instructor informed the class about tutoring services available.","In each lecture, Dr. [Removed] shows a problem on the board and asks students to work together to talk through the problem and solve it on their own by themselves. She then goes over the problem on the board after enough time has been given to discuss the problem with others","Dr. [Removed] constantly reminds us that genetics is important to the study of humans and our lives as future healthcare professionals if that is the path we have chosen to go down. In each weekly homework, one of the three recurring questions is for students to explain what they learned in the module that is significant to them and the real world.","whenever she's done reviewing a topic, a few slides, or even a simple idea, she makes sure to ask everyone if there are any questions before moving on to the next thing","One of the assignments was an \" about me \" assignment and allowed to give info about the student's background or past.","In this course, the instructor consistently allowed students a few minutes to think independently before asking for responses to questions. For instance, after presenting a complex problem, they would say, “ Take two minutes to think about your approach, [Removed] down any initial thoughts, and then we'll discuss. ” This pause gave everyone time to gather their ideas, which led to more thoughtful answers and a willingness to participate, as students felt less pressure to respond immediately","He shares how you need to visualize the circuits to be able to figure out the correct equations and usages.","The instructor shares questions on the screen for us to answer via a polling method every class but. before he opens the question he tells us to discuss and share with our peers around us to work together and figure out the answers to the problems.","The instructor often gave lots of time for independent or group thinking. This was all throughout the course. The instructor would often invite the students to \" think on it \".","In the ethics discussions as well as our research reports we either needed to discuss scientific data or talk about the ethics behind it. For the annotated bibliography we had to complete, we also had to interpret scientific data.","Dr. [Removed] gave us resources at the beginning of the semester that would encourage us to do fun things in [Removed] and to take breaks from studying. I think this is beneficial because even though she encourages studying and success, she knows students need breaks.","She tells us to take these surveys so she is able to make the course better for new students.","The professor constantly reiterates the idea that students in this course will be amazing people outside of class. She states that our life has much more meaning than a class grade and we are people who matter. This means a lot to me as a student.","She sent out announcements encouraging studying or other assistance available. \n.","The exam analysis forms are completed once the entire section has completed the exam. This allows students to review their wrong answers, see the right answers and learn from their mistakes. Points are given back on the exam.","Our instructor includes examples for datasets and data visualizations about the real world.","Created small groups and talked about personal experiences fostering learning environments and getting to know peers in grad and [Removed] school","I think Dr. [Removed] always mentions some fascinating research going on about what we are learning and how that can be important to people in different majors. For example, when learning about the resting potential and how that is a thing that happens in neurons, she mentions how neuroscience majors might want to look a bit more into this.","This survey is one of those times he's allowing us opportunities to reflect on our experience. He generally allows us to talk about our learning experience in participation questions and tries to stay in tune with the thoughts of his students.","There are experiements done in class that show what specifically is happening and further the understanding of why we are learning something. An example of this is the exploding pumpkin that made us understand the low gas heat capacity and the reaction that would happen with it. There are also sections in the lecture notes that connect real world examples.","They went over generally what would happen with missed classes and what not.","Before getting into the lecture, the instructor told us that there was an extra credit opportunity if we submitted feedback in this very form.","The teacher will give a practice quiz so we can assess what the actual quiz will be like. This is very helpful and I'm glad she does this every quiz week.","After the exams specifically, my instructor will take time to encourage us and tell us how well we did and even after getting through hard units and topics, she will make sure we know all that we have done. It is very encouraging and I love hearing that we are doing well and have learned a lot already","Following exam 1, we did a survey giving feedback about the exam, but one of the questions asked for a reflection about the effectiveness of our studying strategies leading up to the exam and what we could do better when studying for the next exam.","The teacher showed us cool experiments that correlated with the materials we were learning in class. on Halloween, the teacher was teaching combustion and performed a combustion experiment with a pumpkin. The teacher then explained the process of gas exchange and how it exploded the pumpkin.","She always talks about her background and encourages us to connect with her. She does this quite often but I can't name an exact time.","Dr. [Removed] provides more than enough resources. It truly is so helpful, but it's up to one to apply that knowledge.","Sawyer is always sure to encourage us to come to office hours or talk to her about anything we need whether it's a bad day or needing help with our lab. [Removed] has expressed us how much she cares about this lab and why she joined it to begin with, and she is sure to provide us with any help we need.","I remember when we were doing the ampicillin lawns she explained how this is used to find real life antibiotics i found this very interesting.","The professor asks her students to spend some time thinking about a concept she is teaching. She also provides problem sets on the board for us to solve together between our peers sitting next to us.","We often work with plenty of datasets that can apply to the real world and my professor also includes real - world examples in our lectures frequently.","We have a program called \" [Removed] \" attached to the course where we can submit concerns / questions. There have been times when frequently asked / requested information has been addressed during lecture. One of these times, our respondus test browser was not functioning correctly for some students, so it was addressed during the lecture ( she talked us through what applies to each of us if we had an [Removed] or computer ).","Says this is the ground base for the future chemistry classes","Dr. [Removed] has shared general struggles with us, I do not actually recall a specific event of this however, sorry, I just know that she definitely has.","Our professor asked us to discuss between one another one of the questions placed on the board. We were to discuss the idea behind the question then work together to solve the question. That's how the professor stated we had to tackle the problem","We had an assignment that required us to reflect on our study habits before the first exam. We were also asked which aspects of our study habits are in or out of our control.","One of the main objectives in taking this class is to provide students with research - based learning as opposed to lecture - based. We have read in class that people from different backgrounds respond to lecture - based learning in different ways, with many students not benefiting from this structure. We have been taught in class that it's important to structure class so that everyone can participate where they may not have otherwise and aid in the research towards solving the antibiotic crisis.","At the beginning of the year, my instructor went over the syllabus that provided details about late policy and rescheduled test days, mainly in correlation to religion. She wanted to make sure that everyone would be accommodated for test times, and know of them at the beginning of the year.","she expands on some of the topics on how the material we are learning relates to the current research etc","She just says to talk to the person next to you and that's about it during class to answer some questions.","I believe this was referenced early on in the course, as Dr. [Removed] stated that she didn't expect students to perform like great scientists or completely understand / ace each exam. I believe she said that failure is a learning outcome every student should expect from the course and that it is inherently unavoidable.","My professor has consistently told us that she has opportunities for office hours to talk to her about anything regarding the course or anything that may or may not need changing to guarantee student success. She has also given out surveys asking what our next steps are regarding chemistry and has told us that she cares about our feedback and improving the course.","Dr. [Removed] has sent links for opportunities to get involved in doing research outside of the class he sent this mostly in late September I believe. Dr. [Removed] also in late September sent a link for a program for biotechnology in [Removed]. He also lets us touch his fossils if we are interested he did this last week.","Last week, Dr. [Removed] went over our project and talked briefly about how people had to clean up data in the past and how it can be done correctly or incorrectly. I forget the exact words but something along the lines of people in the past will remove important data when trying to clean it up and that is incorrect.","Described different ways to study \n And mentioned that studying with others is helpful and others that understand the material can always teach you.","Dr. [Removed] often allows us to think about the real - world implications of important concepts we are learning.","During our instapolls we were tasked with writing our thoughts about the current topic in class and to give our opnions. This happened about a week ago in class.","For our ecology note, we must interpret data to draw conclusions about species diversity. Additionally, during lecture, Dr. [Removed] walked us through how to organize data.","He has us do instapolls and gives us time to work independently with a partner before we go over it as a class.","I don't remember him doing this","Dr. [Removed] definitely mentioned this when opening her course and share this level of encouraging thought after quizzes.","She has us sit in teams during class so that we can talk about the questions that are asked during class.","She encouraged us to come to office hour if puzzled. She supports students to ask questions","Never has Professor [Removed] made anyone feel like they wouldn't be able to go through this course successfully. She always reiterates the potentials students have to work hard and learn.","Dr. [Removed] gives us ample opportunity to provide feedback on the course to improve it for both current and future students.","Her \" Learning Module \" assignments contain content like this. It contains material for the next lecture or beyond.","Dr. [Removed]'s assignments always have students reflect on what we learned during the week. Each week, she asks us to submit questions from that week's lectures and then answers them for us.","We participate during class by asking questions and answering questions asked by the professor.","There are squarecap comment sections so we can ask questions.","I feel that we actively problem solve in our small groups everyday in lab, as we talk with our small groups on how to navigate the lab. [Removed], we also have done activities as a small group in which we rated different posters as a small group and told the class our rankings.","She plugged her music career ( so cool )","Professor [Removed] spares time before class to discuss relevant topics, be in globally or personally. It's a refreshing take and helps ease the class before lecture begins.","In our course, the instructor distributed a mid - semester feedback survey, emphasizing its importance by stating, \" Your insights are crucial for helping me enhance our learning environment. \" This occurred during the 7th week.","We would have students asking questions freely everyday and the professor would make sure the students understand and clarify their doubts","This is not a specific moment but [Removed] always allows us to have conversations about things other than lab as long as we are staying on task. This has made lab very enjoyable and allowed me to bond with my lab partners.","Our instructor makes sure to ask a handful of students their opinion when asking a question to the class.","Every time we have questions we ask through square cap.","Dr. [Removed] always encourages class participation, and he will pause and tell us to talk with our neighbors to discuss what we think. Then we'll come together and he'll call on some of us. This happens about every class. He usually gives us 1 - 2 minutes to think and talk before he gives us the answers, and he doesn't discourage wrong answers. While working on practice problems, he'll also pause and ask us what we think and have us think for a moment ( because it's usually pretty simple ) before we answer.","She always makes sure that we know that we can go to her if we don't understand something ( and that she has cookies during office hours if we'd like ). She makes a point to tell us that we're doing well or that she will do her best to help us understand from a different perspective if we don't understand.","Always makes a point that our previous exam grades or whatnot isn't indicative of what we can achieve in the future.","She provides opportunities to learn as every week she requires you to find what you need help in and share what has been challenging for you while being supportive and not shaming those with questions.","Our, instructor, has us answer insta poll questions and work with peers every lecture. In addition, the presentations have collaborative questions.","going thru practice problems, making those mistakes and asking students to correct her","Dr. [Removed] uses an application called [Removed] where students can ask questions, offer advice, and even collaborate. The best part of this is that it's completely anonymous, so we don't feel pressured to ask a “ smart ” question. Furthermore, she often encourages and reminds us of this resource during class, and she states that questions are how we grow.","We are asked to turn to the person sitting next to us and ask them about their weekend, etc.","Dr. [Removed] provides the lecture slides to be able to follow along with her lecture. This happened every lecture day.","During lecture while doing practice problems, Dr [Removed] makes sure to answer any questions from students. During one specific problem ( I can't remember when ), a lot of students asked questions and the general consensus I felt from others sitting near me was confusion. Dr [Removed] spent more time on the problem / slide, even if it did drag out the class.","In the beginning of the semester there were many points where we were instructed to share facts about ourselves with other students in the class. There were also some questions built into assignments that asked about our interests and activities outside of the course.","Although we don't use an actual polling app, we do poll in a way that has us share answers and see what the majority answered using the course packet.","The professor always tries to tell us about the background information of what he is teaching to help us stay engaged and informed about the topic on a deeper level.","We recently had our first exam and Dr. [Removed] reminded us that if we did not do as well as we hoped, there is an option to take a replacement exam ( for the 1st and 2nd exams ) during finals week later in the term. She explained how this is meant to help us know it's okay to make mistakes and if we feel we grasp the content better as the semester continues, we should be able to show that.","They would always suggest how to study and improve oursoeves","We were talking about bonding in class and there was a demonstration of the shapes of what the atoms truly look like in a three dimensional space. This demonstration occurred in the second unit of the course and the instructor asked us questions to allow us to find our own way to the answer.","Usually after finishing a part of the lecture, we get given a practice problem usually with a molecular formula or a model of a molecule and we have to discuss the question and decide what that molecule would look like or how it would behave.","The instructor would state that if any students had issues with testing accommodations that they should reach out to the university. They would explain what the accommodations looked like on tests for those who asked.","Caudill encourages students to talk with her if we are having issues with course material or accommodations during office hours.","He does mention when we take tests but i don't remember the exact day.","In this course, we frequently worked in groups during lab sessions to isolate and analyze bacteria from soil samples. This collaboration occurred from the start of the semester, as the instructor emphasized teamwork by saying, “ You'll learn more by working together and sharing your observations. ” We were encouraged to discuss results, troubleshoot issues, and share techniques, which helped us understand the material more deeply through peer interaction.","In the lecture slides, Professor [Removed] will provide real - world examples of what some mutations or conditions look like and what individuals with these conditions experience. Sometimes she includes ones that aren't in the textbook. She also adds articles at the beginning of each module in canvas that cover real - life connections to what we're going to learn in the module.","I personally have never shared anything about our background nor past experience in this course.","This instructor was really god at providing step by step and student examples of how to take notes and study college level courses. She helped us outline and prepare for these various ideas while also providing us with worksheets to work through these common struggles","our instructor never tries to give us the answer at first she always asked us what we think in our logic behind what we think before telling us, whether we are thinking about the problem correctly and giving us another way to think about it if needed","In the beginning of the course, the professor talked about what specifically we as students should do if we need to miss an exam or turn in an assignment late due to a life event. They also included this information in the syllabus. They also remind us about the policy in the days preceding exams, making it easy on students to follow the steps if needed.","At the end of class, the instructor tells the students about how much they have learned and that their knowledge will get better with practice and using the worksheets done in class.","Can't remember the exact details, but I remember this happening.","We have multiple learning modules a week. In these modules you can resubmit the assignment 3 times to get a better grade.","-","He often asks us and seems to truly care about what is going on in the class.","We reviewed concepts about registration and played a game that demonstrated our knowledge of what we had reviewed. After each question, the instructor clarified and allowed questions after class.","She once said that what we're learning is the foundation for more difficult chemistry courses.","Dr. [Removed] talks about study strategies before our tests and what we can do to learn material. It was helpful.","At the end of the course the students are allowed to take retests for exams. These can improve their previous grade.","Dr. [Removed] talks to us about growth mindset and how going into healthcare requires that we have this mindset and also that we are able to apply things we learn conceptually.","the professor gives us time to work with our peers in solving quiz questions","She gave me an extension but not resubmit.","What happened in the course is when we are lecturing she will go into topics on further units just to give us a peek of what we will soon be going into. This happens typically at the end of the week and end of the lecture.","I had to miss an exam due to an external conflict, and the professor was very accommodating in giving me a fair opportunity to take a make up exam.","[Removed] lets us talk about our personal lives and chat when we are working on experiments, so it helps us know our lab partners better. Also, during the soil collection procedure we drove to a site to collect soil","Dr. [Removed]'s class is open to giving extra credit to those who work for it and is beneficial to those who show an improved understanding of subjects. Such extra credit may include dropping certain grades or giving greater credit to particularly poor grades.","While I do not remember the specific instances of this occuring or what exactly was said, I do remember Dr. [Removed] having brought up that topic or something similar to it in class and said something to the effect of making sure to work hard and get where you want to go.","Not much in ckass","He encouraged us to find study groups because studying together is always better than alone. This happened on the first day of class. \" I encourage you to form study groups with your peers because you can learn from one another. \"","Depending on prior chemistry background / knowledge, Dr. [Removed] makes it clear that failure is OK and a learning curve instead of a permanent setback and catching up, is not impossible by any means","She asks for feedback and we talk during discussions","Professor [Removed] used an example of [Removed] [Removed] win ratios as an example for linear regression models. This occurred approximately a week prior to taking this survey.","Almost every week Dr. [Removed] encourages us to go to office hours, use gchem, and ask questions on [Removed] discussion for help.","After we take a quiz, Dr. [Removed] gives us time to reflect on the stats of the questions in the next lecture.","When professor [Removed] goes over material whether that be in the course of during the modules she makes sure to point out mistakes sometimes students tend to make and warns us so we don't make them.","Dr. [Removed] took extra time to answer students' questions in the [Removed] Discussion and Office Hours.

I was luckily able to talk to her during the soil collecting and funny enough, talked about the [Removed] [Removed] [Removed]. I believe that talking about stuff outside of science or work is a great conversation to have.","He offers TA office hours as well as his own office hours, as well as the usage of the [Removed] Learning center and [Removed] coaching in the [Removed].","I can't say much but I think professor [Removed] sometimes during lecture or modules has mentioned things that she really enjoys and enjoyed as a student chem wise and how it's impacted her.","On squarecap we are able to type any questions or suggestions for Dr. [Removed] to read during class.","This was communicated only recently because of the release of this survey.

She will tell us of her personal struggles in real life, such as relationships extending outside of a school environment as well. This is nice, however at times it feels extensive whenever I would like to just get along with the lesson ( i am much more objectively interacting in school in general though so i might not be the best gauge. ).","she applies it in real life \n","I would say that we have to do this for some pre - labs. When working on a pre - lab, you may have to interpret data to find an answer.","Dr. [Removed] teaches a class about the moon and always mentions places we can go to find more information on it. He mentions this during class","she showed what the skills can do and she did this at the begining of the course.","He would make connections to units we have not covered yet so that we could see a clear connection between areas of physics that may overlap.

We first did them in groups, then we could share with the class.","Dr. [Removed] will ask the class a question about the topic we are learning about in class and he expects someone in the class to shout out an answer. He does this almost every lecture to get students engaged and know that they are listening.","She was nice.","The instructor has talked about everyone's different approach to learning multiple tines in class.","Never brought up outside of syllabus. I can not speak much to it.","Beginning of the course, was very clear about policies though most policies for late assignments or missed exams are similar","In our first discussion, our activity was to explore different career options that are related to ecology. We read different articles on career paths and shared what we found interesting with our group mates.","Professor always offers options to contact her or TAs.","She lists services we can find to help us and has reached out to check up on us. She also advises in beginning of lectures to take time for ourselves and not burnout.","Encourages all students to participate even if they think their answer is wrong.","Dr. [Removed] is very kind and always offers help when we need it. If we are struggling she is open and points us to helpful resources.","The instructor highlighted the diverse backgrounds of influential scientists during a lecture on relativity. When we studied [Removed]'s theory of relativity in the fourth week, the instructor talked about how [Removed], a [Removed] - born physicist of Jewish heritage, had to flee [Removed] [Removed] and continue his work in the [Removed] [Removed]. She said, \" [Removed]'s identity as a German - Jewish immigrant shaped his worldview and his role in advocating for both scientific progress and social justice. \" This added a deeper, more human context to his scientific achievements, emphasizing how personal and cultural histories intersect with groundbreaking discoveries.","She provides links to more in depth information and discuss in class resources and strategies if needed.","She always ensures to mention that \" [Removed], food and hydration are as important as studying \".

He always dedicates time right when the lecture ends to answer the questions.","Dr. [Removed] has stated multiple times that he gives opportunities to have lower homework grades dropped. This survey is an example of something he has given us for this week. I am sure if a life altering event were to happen he would give grace.","I believe she was explaining something to us and after she finished explaining she asked if the explanation was good or if she should do it another way. We told the TA is was good the first time, so she didn't have to change anything.","In this course, we have a demo almost weekly and they usually align with the timing that it is presented during. For example, during Halloween time we had a demo that used a pumpkin.","Dr. [Removed] does [Removed] sessions and has DSWs and ICAs with FRQs.

You can also use the study skills in other spheres of your lives.","When we review the squarecap problems in class, Dr. [Removed] points out processes that can be tricky and common misconceptions that can lead to the wrong answer. It's a really helpful process that can reorient my thinking about physics and improve in the future.","Lab instructor reminds us every lab that she has weekly student office hours to ask any question or concerns!","She has mentioned several times about helpful advice and goals in the future","I can't exactly remember a specific moment. But I do know he told us to let him know about any specific accommodations needed.","Our instructor asked us to write a brief paragraph that explained why or why not we were in interested in physics and what physics courses we may have taken, along with what our potential difficulties may be with the class. This occurred at the beginning of the semester, at the beginning of a class.","We are told to discuss questions with the people around us. This can lead to getting to know people outside of class.","In the syllabus it says that we should reach out to the instructors if we are sick and miss a significant amount of class days.","Dr. [Removed] was celebrating how much we have learned in [Removed] - [Removed] so far. This happened in lecture last week as she encouraged us to reflect on our coding skills now compared to the beginning of the year.","We can make up half points on exams by explaining the correct way to answer the question, not just by giving the correct answer a second time. We can also ask for help from TA's or Dr. [Removed] himself to work through this process.","Dr [Removed] has linked concepts we're currently learning to future concepts that could come up in more advanced chemistry courses, or to the types of real world applications they have. I am not a pre - med student, but most of the things she mentions are relevant to pre - med coursework.","Very early on into the class, maybe even the first day, he described his journey towards becoming a professor. He explained his move to [Removed], and how he continued his education at [Removed] [Removed]. It made it feel more personal when we knew he was in our positions once.","The instructor knew that most of us were new to researching techniques and always helped us during class","The week before our first exam, our instructor encouraged us to study with other students. She emphasized the fact that explaining the material to others is the best way to test our understanding of the material.","I know that Dr. [Removed] has additional resources posted on his canvas page for any of his students that need to reach out and explain if they are going through significant life challenges. I always see him talking to students after class and he spends that   time answering their questions and posting resourceful information on [Removed] discussion. I have not personally asked him for additional support, but I would feel confident and comfortable approaching him or any of the TAs if I needed to.","She would suggest the library for course material, [Removed] learning center etc","The [Removed] hasn't mentioned clear policies for late assignments or missed exams when life events disrupt students since the first week. If she has, then it was very quiet or off to the side.","She mentions it every day as [Removed] fears she isn't a great teacher","We solve instapoll questions with a peer.","I don't remember a specific moment but I remember Dr. [Removed] talking about how the content in this course spans other prior knowledges in other courses. She expected us to know about these already from said courses.","This course has allowed me to feel more confident in my ability to do scientific research. Gaining hands on experience has been very insightful and exciting. My professors and TAs have done nothing but guide and support me in both times of need and certainty.","Every single time in class Dr. [Removed] will ask us a question and he will wait for us to think independently and then tell us to ask our neighbors.","We have surveys where we reflect on our perspectives in the class. In these surveys we reflect on our mindset regarding the class and the proper mindset we should have to succeed in the class.","it is a hard class and the professor acknowledged that in the beginning and has continued to do so since. after the first test he emphasized that if we did bad we can do better on future tests and he encouraged us to go to his office hours and speak to him about what we can do to study and learn the material better. He was very supportive and said we could still do well in the class to just keep trying.","Every class she asks us for responses and or to communicate with our neighbors.","He will look on [Removed] Discussion and answer all the questions asked during class. He also encourages students to ask questions during class out loud and has a lot of drop - in office hours to answer questions.","The muddiest point instapoll gives students a chance to share what they're still confused about","She let's us work together to solve instapoll and practice problems during class and goes through it with us afterwards.","I haven't really seen that before which is why I put slightly certain.","This is a pretty hard to bring up in a class like genetics, but I will the class is very welcoming to diversity and not bias restrained.","I think it was for a maymester.","The instructor frequently has students discuss practice problems amongst themselves.","We just finished our unit 3 exam and have started unit 4. This unit is longer compared to our other units and we have [Removed] break in between so our instructor has told us to continue reviewing our notes on break as well as ask questions to her or our TA's.","My professor makes us discuss the topic learned in class with the peers around us. This happens every lecture. After teaching a topic, she tells us to speak among ourselves.","We are given every possible learning material to succeed in this course. The TAs and professor provide us with practice exams, quizzes, learning modules, and many resources to succeed.","In the beginning of the course the professor gave examples of certain careers in which data science is useful.","I do not remember.","when we talk about growth mindset he asks about concerns","I think she was just talking about help for the course to reach out to TAs, go to office hours, academic community, and study independently if you feel like you need more support.","I think this one is mainly implied, as if you like the research aspect of the class then you will be more inclined to wanting to continue down this path. I ve often heard people ask the instructors how to apply for their certain position, etc, showing new interest in lab directing.","Gives links to research opportunities, experiential learning, held a [Removed] for research opportunities","She is quick to encourage us when the idea of tests and homework seems daunting","She is open to talking about different learning strategies especially if we did bad on an exam.","I don't remember exactly","During the labs","She has mentioned her own story in physics, talking about what it took to get to where she is now. This has included some struggles in school, but she was able to succeed regardless.","During exam times or during check - in times, my instructor would promote academic accommodations for students. She would utilize the testing center for those who need accomodations.","This was during this past week after our first exam and the instructor told us we did a good job and we've made it this far so we only have improvement ahead of us.","I remember that this occurred towards the beginning of the year. The professor provides the textbook that goes through essential not related to the course.","This has not occured.","Creates [Removed] note - taking modules that are to be done before class. Also, post the lecture slides before class begins in order to follow along for proper note - taking.","The instructor often enforces the idea of having a growth mindset and encourages us to continue practicing in order to achieve the outcomes in this class that we want. This usually occurs at the beginning / end of class or through announcements on canvas.","In office hours we would discuss and go through common mistakes or con fusion amongst the classes.","Our instructors and [Removed]'s reassured me in my field of study throughout the semester. Making these connections from our classwork to my major made me feel reassured and safe in what I am currently pursuing.","Many times every class, the instructor will call on students groups to get one of those students to answer questions asked in a slideshow verbally. This is a key part of the lectures and happens frequently.","The instructor often states how far we've come from the beginning of the semester and how much we've developed our skills and knowledge of our material.","It didn't really happen","Once the try it is completed, she waits for questions and even walks around the room to see if we're on the right path. She also answers the question herself and shows us how she would structure the answer so we can ask questions about what we did differently.","Generally, the professor tries to make connections between what we learn in this class, and how we could apply it elsewhere. For example, he would explain his own challenges in the course when he was a student, and what he did to improve himself.","We sometimes look into topics that will not happen in until the next chapter to begin a foundation. Like toady, Professor may say something like \" this is for unit four but as a basis for now.. \"","My professor mentioned this survey today, and the benefits of the feedback.","For this course, it is necessary to understand how certain theories in chemistry were developed. Because of this, Professor [Removed] and Professor [Removed] have both described how certain theories evolved and which scientists contributed to them - which, I believe, is acknowledging the historical context of the people and ideas discussed in this course. Unfortunately, I can not remember specific instances.","She had us to the [Removed] survey on Mondays. Questions were not hard.","I can not remember if this happened.","Several times during lectures, my instructor would discuss how she grew up in [Removed], and talks about her life experiences regarding physics with that perspective. She also is a follower of Growth Mindset, which is unique to every individual due to their own life experiences. However, she never stated exactly that \" a variety of perspectives are necessary and can uniquely contribute to new knowledge \".","Professor [Removed] would make sure and emphasize on mistakes that could be made. She is very thorough on her explanations on how not to get confused.","Dr. [Removed] while going over lewis structures spoke about the structure of certain molecular compounds that correlated to common medicine, such as [Removed]. We discussed as a class how understanding the polar and non - polar properties of certain medications plays a role in their function in the body. She mentioned this being of interest to those of us going into medicine after college.","The instruction were included on the syllabus.","The instructor set up spreadsheets for study groups.","She told us about her experience in college and how she wanted to major in chem. She told us this during the beginning of the course","Sometimes during the chemistry lectures, the brings out graduate TA's that perform physical experiments about the topics we are learning about. During [Removed] law she brought out balloons filled with different gasses to explain the photoelectric effect. During boiling points she brought out different liquid gases to see how fast they boil. She has used liquid nitrogen and balloons to explain the ideal gas law.","She started class of by telling us how she thought she was a failure earlier on in her career. She kept trying knew ways and different tactics until she was successful.","Dr [Removed] allows about 10 - 15 minutes to answer the 10 question squarecap practice at the end of lecture before going over the lectures. He and the TAs walk around to answer any questions we have.","After our first test","No matter what grades we have in the course as of right now, we would succeed much better if we were to retake the course. We have learned a lot and to get to this point in the course we have done a great job.","We used instapoll to answer polling questions.","Dr. [Removed] always answers all of the students' questions and clarifies any misunderstanding before moving onto the next concept or lesson. She consistently checks in with us through [Removed] and makes the effort to listen to our feedback. She would then give the students the reassurance they need, and if she believes that a lot of students are confused on a topic, she would go back and reexplain it.","Dr. [Removed] uses what is common at the University of [Removed] at [Removed], UTInstapoll. It is a randomized poll that occurs in the middle of lecture which answers the question writen above.","In quest, we have modules to review foundational concepts, like algebra and trig that we can refer to at any time.","In class, we have independent activities that lets us figure out how to alter codes so we can learn the material ourselves. She encourages a lot of independent work and allows us to try things ourselves, which I find to be difficult yet helpful in helping things stick in my mind.","She will go over any questions the students may have about material that is harder to grasp. Also encourages students to speak up even if they are not sure of the answer.","We have chances to go over the exams and review our mistakes how to study and how to improve.","When discussing the duality of light, Dr. [Removed] discussed multiple experiments that were made to find this knowledge. Each experiment each gleaned some information that together came up with this duality of light.","Our instructor lectures on units and often does experiments to show real - world examples of what we learned. For example, when learning about gas laws, she did a demo of using pressure to blow up a pumpkin.","In the course, the instructor implemented a peer review activity during the final project phase, where students were required to exchange drafts and provide constructive feedback. At the start of the activity, the instructor said, \" Your feedback should be specific and focus on both strengths and areas for improvement — this is a chance to learn from each other. \"","She provides a study guide for each week on [Removed], which lists the learning objectives.","At the end of every class, there is a squarecap which is like a poll but it is for a grade. Actually, now thinking about it, its not really a poll but to get a better understanding of the material even though some of the questions are confusing as referring to the lecture that was just presented.","Dr. [Removed] takes time to answer any questions during lecture as well as provides additional time for students to come and either ask her for help directly or any of the TAs.","By describing how getting into [Removed] has shown how far we've already gotten","We would answer polling questions in small groups and discuss ideas on what the answer could be","When we went over ions in unit 2 ( 1.5 months ago ), Dr [Removed] encouraged us to review the ions listed in the prerequisite modules on multiple occasions. She told us that this knowledge would only benefit us on the exam.","When we were talking about periodic table trends, she asked us to turn and talk about why it is the way it is. This happened during lecture. After we talked, she went through some elements and wrote out their [Removed] to then explain the [Removed] trend, which correlates to the radius trend, which correlates to [Removed].","The professor reminded us of the syllabus policies on late work.","Actually he provides extra credits by homework credit, square cap credit, discussion section credit, survey credit, and etc. It helps us to improve our grade and les concern about the mistakes.","I remember Dr. [Removed] tell us about how she studied analytical chemistry a few weeks ago. She tells us her own personal thoughts on which questions topics she think is harder than others which helps us relate with her.","Every week Dr. [Removed] provides us with background information relevant to the activities in lab that week. With this background information Dr. [Removed] always provides links to resources where we can explore deeper into the topics that we cover in lab.","Dr. [Removed] mentions how its important for us to make mistakes on instapoll and the quizzes so that we can do everything right on the exam. She mentioned this last class and has made sure to show us the importance of each assignment so that we learn that we should make mistakes before the exam.","Dr. [Removed] uses instapolls to ask us a question about something we just learned in class. It could be a calculation problem or application problem.","The instructor went over common misconceptions. Next, she explained them through various approaches.","Every day in class we have questions that everyone answers for participation points, and they're either based off of what we learned last lecture or what our prelecture worksheet was about.","Valuable collecting student feedback is important for improving the teaching in the class because it allows for the instructor to get a sense of how students are feeling about the course and what needs to be changed to improve student learning and understanding. The instructor does a great job of this because she allows 2 - 3 surveys each week to recieve feedback on that week's concept and understanding to see what she can do to do better for her students.","We have Instapolls which are either multiple - choice or open - ended.","There is no pre requisite for this class","Provided test retakes for each test. Gave people opportunity to figure out what about their studying was right or wrong.","Some students gave a little talk at the beginning of class about a physics group, I can't remember what it was because I was late that day and only caught the end, but when they finished the talk the professor encouraged us to participate in it.","I can't remember.","I don't specifically remember what it was, but I feel like I remember some times where a topic would be mentioned and an example of its use would be referenced. These are not focuses of the lectures just might be occasionally brought up.","Dr. [Removed] mentions how we have already finished [Removed] [Removed] successfully which has many applications to ecology. She lets us know how well we are doing on tests and instapolls verbally and is very supportive of our efforts.","We use [Removed] to interact with each other and discuss ideas for ethics assignments","During class he was talking about his background. He told us he had a background in string theory and that he had taken a hard class once, and it bummed him out over a grade, even though it was higher than average.","She has always stated she is available to help during office hours and through email.","I am not sure but I do think that the professor always made a point to be sure everybody understood what she just talked about.","I do not remember the exact moment before and after. I remember my instructor saying the words.","We have a group project where we have to come up with a scientific question. We had to watch videos about how to collaborate with peers in group assignments.","She does mention the people who had developed the topic.","On Wednesday, we were learning about [Removed] [Removed] and the rules that apply. Dr. [Removed] made sure to go over all of the rules of [Removed] [Removed] and practiced solving Lattice [Removed] problems with the students.","Dr. [Removed] would talk about his journey when he was first studying physics in undergrad. He would make connections as to how he ended up where he is.","She advises us to go to office hours to ask questions or share our concerns. She says this at least once a week","My professor relates physics concepts to our everyday lives like driving or using the washer and dryer in our apartment. She also shows us demonstrations in class.","using homeworks and test retakes.","My lab TA asks us questions while explaining procedures and also answers all questions thoroughly.","The modules that she posts before each lecture are very helpful to look over. Every time that I do not look over them before the lecture, I get confused due to how fast she goes.","Dr. [Removed] has instapolls during each class. In some classes, she will ask us about our opinions on the pace of the class, the material that we are learning, and if we think that the grading and assignments are fair.","We have install questions throughout our lectures that relate to the topic discussed. We can consult our peers to help find the solution to the question, which is really helpful,","While answering course questions this week, we were given a few minutes to answer the questions ourselves and then go over the answer as a class.","On one of our square caps last week, we were given a question that required more knowledge than what was explained in the lecture. We had to ask a TA for help and were told to try our best with the knowledge we knew, and attempt to apply that to the question even though we didn't understand all the information.","It's usually based on [Removed] in class where we apply what we have learned. One example that comes to mind is based on the formulas what direct would a particle travel in an induced magnetic field. And he brings out a demo and asks us to consider what type of particle it may be","She made sure to create groups and shuffle them to promote collaboration.","The instructor asks for feedback during class ( if we understand the material ) and always ensures we have a firm grasp on the material during office hours.","She gave us articles to read to understand what we will be doing in class.","Like I said earlier, whenever the professor explains a problem or whenever we do practice problems, we are encouraged by the professor to talk to our neighbor and see if they understand. \n He encourages us like this each class.","This course is called engineering physics in which most of the applications we learn about are applied in the field of engineering. Dr. [Removed] is really good at creating problems or examples that reflect real - world scenarios that people may encounter in their respective engineering field / [Removed]","He reference the textbook","She often lets us know that we are learning the same material that the other classes are learning and that we should reach out to them","Almost in every single class day Dr. [Removed] has shown us some type of video or real world example that ties into what we are learning and allows us to visualize the concepts he teaches.","I can't recall a specific instance but I know for a fact that professor [Removed] always shares about her personal life and career as it pertains to physics.","After Exam 1 Dr. [Removed] said we could retake it in the \" Unit 1 Replacement period \" if we were not happy with our score. She said to go over resources she posted for us to do better.","She has made a very safe space for us students to ask her questions in every setting.","Our instructor encourages us to utilize office hour time if our questions are not asked in lecture to ensure our lecture moves smoothly and we all understand the material well.","Dr. [Removed] acknowledges that this class has people of many different physics backgrounds, which is why he gives out test correction. He also gives out very occasionally gives opportunities for extra credit.","Every week we have a research report where we answer questions about what we did in lab that week, and we have all week to do it and ask questions if needed.","This happened during a stats survey in class to help represent the data. This allowed me to demonstrate some of my interests.","Very often posts short practices questions that make us analyze graphs, or charts and draw conceptual conclusions from it.","She has asked people to share how they got the answers to the instapoll questions.","We pair up and discuss practice questions","Dr. [Removed] always answers the questions students post on [Removed].","Before weekly lectures, the professor begins class with a weekly overview of what content we'll be going over, upcoming assignments / exams, and opens the classroom to allow students to ask questions.","The instructor never specifically said that we will not succeed if we have no prior knowledge or experience within the course. She gives anyone who had or has little to no knowledge of the course the means to succeed through the materials and the refreshers on past knowledge they may have missed.","Dr [Removed] has repeated multiple times that one bad grade does not define you, mentions retakes for exams multiple times per unit, and also reviews material covered in AP chem","We have this thing called [Removed], and it gives us an opportunity to ask each other questions and respond to other students. He also gives us time to ask questions before the lecture and after and after each slide.","She posted about how she'd like to talk to people in her office hours","The instructor provides us with graded learning modules online. Whenever we complete these, we have the opportunity to re - complete them if we missed any questions.","Every month we have had a reflection on how it would be effective to study for tests, how to prepare for homeworks and class.","The instructor refers to office hours and tutoring sessions available to students almost every class.","The time that stands out to me the most is when Dr. [Removed] opened up about his own experience with college and how he failed his first physics course in college. He also opened up about his struggling to adjust to college because of mental health issues.","She would talk about how these concepts can be used towards everyday life. I can't remember the exact words but she encourages to use these concepts moving forward","Beginning of semester, sharing her own in - the - field experiences \n","Dr. [Removed] has show us multiple videos on growth mindset and send us messages on how to improve. We also get a second chance on our weekly quizzes which are graded with feedback so we can improve our score.","Since this course is more project - based, I feel it is not as relevant as in a test - based course","This was given in the syllabus.","In the syllabus it states this and provides resources","we do little one word check in","She told us about this","Offered alternate testing site","For example, during the beginning of the semester she gave us review slides for mitosis. She did this in order to review knowledge from last semester biology.","We use [Removed] to answer questions in class. Our instructor often puts a question on the poll and allows us to collaborate and derive our answer.","During exams, some questions would include topics that were adjacent to the concepts that were being fully discussed in class. Although we did not learn about some of these topics, Professor [Removed] reassured us that applying concepts form class to this new topic would allow us to determine the correct answer.","Our instructor ensures to collect feedback after each exam - level of difficulty, what went wrong, how could she improve the exams, what students are struggling with. Based on this feedback, she will modify and curate her other classes","Our professor usually asks us if we are confused about any specific material before continuing to new material.","She encourages everyone to talk to each other and solve problems. Encourages each other to help one another.","He reviews our exams scores and describes how to improve on midterms.","Dr. [Removed] talks about current astronomy and shows video examples of the moon landing etc.","She always says that pre med isn't the only thing we can do with a science degree and that there are other opportunities too. This is good for the students who aren't pre med or want to drop pre med.","He always reassures us that our exam grades do not define us and we just need to work harder and not give up.","She always mentions the replacement exams at the end of the semester. This allows for a redo in mid - terms that went horribly wrong to replace it with a better grade.","I think she is very good about giving material and information that is useful and applicable. She spends time explaining how the information learned can be utilized in future scenarios and how it is practical information. Moreover, she makes time to make sure we understand that connection between material and its application.","dr [Removed] once told us that what we learn in chemistry would not only help premeds, but would help people in other professions","It was mostly about ways students interpret the material and give us ways to understand the material better, such as memorization","The syllabus was reviewed as a group and the policy for such occasions was clearly stated by the instructor. This occurred as a reminder after the first month of class had passed to make sure we were aware.","We were assigned groups during the second week of classes so that we would familiarize ourselves more with our peers and so that we could find more opportunities to ask questions and engage in studying together. Also, we have discussions each week, which also helps us ask questions and talk to multiple people.","She would always say how she wansnt the most smart and still could learn physics, Very inclusive.","sometimes during class she will talk abt the wrong answer as if it were right and then refute it with the real reason as to why it's not correct and why the correct answer is correct","This isn't really applicable as the class is an into and shouldn't deal with cutting edge science","With the instapolls we are able to learn from our mistakes. This is helpfully for us","[Removed] / A","Professor [Removed] always starts lectures sharing the upcoming due dates for homework, exams, surveys, etc. This often appears on the screen in the format \" HW 7 – Due [Removed] 4 on [Removed] \"","We would talk about every question type with each other","We are told to turn to our neighbors and discuss how we would solve the problems. This happens at least once every lecture.","She does this every class day. We are always asked to share what we think about the material with our neighbors.","In order for us to be more prepared while taking on tasks and labs with [Removed], Dr. [Removed] provided us a bunch of resources on the programming language. Additionally, we were always given the lecture slides to brush up on topics we needed.","Every day in class we are given the chance to talk to one another about the problems.","The teacher asked us to share about our weekend and something that made us happy or interesting that happened.","We were not really given opportunities to improve our grades","She often puts prompts on the projector in a lecture period and asks students to briefly discuss with their neighbors what they think the answer is. Students then discuss and the answer is provided after that period of discussion.","Dr. [Removed] always states who came up with the idea that we are discussing in class. If there is relevant current research, she also brings that to our attention.","The professor has never invited me to design materials or assignments in the course.","Will ask questions and wait a little bit before asking for an answer. Also allows us to work through some of the material before being asked questions.","This course is a hands on course with an attendance policy. I think taking [Removed] before this helps but is not necessary to pass this course because it's mainly application. [Removed] walks everyone through how to do each step in the procedure and clearly says what he is looking for.","The instructor has provided modules that allow students to practice prerequisite concepts at their own accord.","Policies were clearly introduced at the beginning of the semester","lots of multiple answer multiple choice questions","The instructor talks about he is interested in the moon. He also like to relate the material we are covering with the moon.","I'm not particularly sure that it allows us to learn from our mistakes, but we are able to get extra credit for submitting surveys. It might be beneficial for future classes to rework the missed quiz problems as a way of learning!","For the last exam, our professor explained to us his first experience on a test and how it was relatively low.","She would at times call on volunteers to answer a question related to coding or a general question she asked. This involved the respondent answering the question in front of the entire class. This happens every class","The instructor was very helpful in celebrating our successes and being there for us for our failures. They were very encouraging and supportive throughout the labs.","She just says to always talk questions out with peers.","She occasionally has us answers questions covering a concept we just went over to ensure that it stuck with us and we understood it. It's just a one question instapoll typically","The instructor made slides that she presents during class.","Physics overall is a very easy applicable concept for the real - world. Most examples are realistic questions that come from a real - world setting.","I know that there are late grades, which is better then a zero, and there is extra credit to help improve the grade average for her class.","The professor always stops her lectures and tells the class to engage with peers around us and discuss a concept on the board. This allows us to gain different perspectives of learning the material and thus learn from each other in a way.","In discussion sections there is plenty of time to ask questions and learn material.","I think this was when we were looking at previous student's research posters and she would ask us what we rated it and why. We went around as a table in the classroom ( one person per table ) would answer that question.","She mentions where resources are available and talks about rescheduling exams for specific reasons related to individuals needs.","When we talk about different genetic variations or conditions, Dr. [Removed] always chooses examples that are representative of different populations throughout the world. She also discusses the scientists behind any discovery or theories she talks about, giving credit to many scientists from different countries or backgrounds.","Our professor encourages students to take advantage of our resources. They set up our academic communities with TAs so we have access to help. She has encouraged us to reach out for help and take advantage of resources such as [Removed] Learning Center and our TAs.","Our instructor always encouraged us to answer questions. She would encourage us to speak and answer or ask our questions in [Removed] rather than [Removed]. Using [Removed] to ask and answer questions helped us learn more in this course because we'd be able to use the new words and grammar we just learned.","During multiple lectures, the professor begins by stating that there are office hours throughout the week where students can get help. During these hours, many questions are answered.","Following our first midterm about a month ago, our professor spent a little time at the end of a lecture going over the results, most missed problems, and possible strategies to improve one's score. Additionally, our professor spent some time informing us about where we approximately need to be if we want X score in the class ( ex : what homework average and test average we need to get an A ).","Dr. [Removed] has talked about her students pursuing a career in physics. She has said many times that physics can be for anyone and you do not have to be a genius to pursue this career path.","Did not happen","She talked about her academic past like her major and what is relevant to us","Sata showed us the distribution of scores after our first test, and he said that it's ok if we didn't do really well since everyone has a different background in [Removed]. He told us to complete the assignment analyzing the questions we missed to do better on the next test.","The instructor provides \" zombie \" problems on exams ; these may revisit you on the next exam. This has motivated me to consistently refresh my knowledge as well as genuinely learn what I did wrong on the previous exam to help me on the next one.","She asks about our interests. She does this every time we have class.","Well things just make more sense the further you go on. So you have these questions with the assignments then next lecture you understand.","Through instapolls, sometimes open ended questions help in putting my interests as answers.","Just recently, we completed a lab where we analyzed the differences in categorical vs quantitative data and the implications it can have in the science world. Overall, this was helpful in refreshing the concepts I learned in biostats last semester.","she makes us keep all options open which is very enlightening","She challenges us sometimes with harder codes, in lab","She has us engage in multiple group projects to learn how to work together and learn from other's ideas and perspectives","The variety of perspectives are necessary and we learn about that in the pre labs because we look at several sources when we read.","He mentioned how he failed his intro physics and told the story of what he did to improve his grades.","Rather than this being something repeated, it was greatly emphasized in the opening weeks, and I feel that this sentiment carries strongly onto later weeks. It's currently more articulated as how current material will be foundation for later learning if we are to continue in chemistry heavy professions, and how mastery of this content will be very beneficial.","Professor [Removed] does not force a career in physics on her students. She understand we each have our own interests and encourages us to incorporate them within the class.","It was on an online module we needed to complete in place of an in - person lecture. The professor couldn't hold class one day so he made an online module with material to read and questions to answer. The first half of the module was all questions and reading about personal development and introspection, including about mental health.","The professor has, multiple times, asked for student answers during our lecture. If the student is right she praises them and continues with the lesson. If the student is wrong, she will correct them cordially, then continue.","He has things on his canvas page that teach us how to effectively answer homework questions. He always tells us to go check it out.","He gauged the rooms for what majors everyone was. It was made apparent that most students were natural science majors ( many of which were taking this class for the [Removed] ).","Incorporates a lot of space physics references and examples in lectures to demonstrate the content","He added a “ [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] \" where there was no correct answer — it was simply a question to think about all the different factors that affect the problem and how it changed the final outcome","She always encourages us to talk to our neighbors / peers and get to know them!","During active learning we go over questions and test our ability to apply our knowledge.","There is group work in class where she asks us to work on a couple of problems with the people next to us.

Then we go over the content all together","Relates physics to real life problems that may not seem apparent in everyday life","The professor began the class with a review of vocabulary needed for the semester and later progressed to logic charts that served as examples to help students understand how to think through probability problems. While some other courses have left me feel like I am behind on the first day, this class had a very smooth transition where I was able to clearly understand how to do the problem solving that was required of me.","Our syllabus for the class clearly states the prerequisite knowledge. We sometimes go over important equations we must know from the prerequisite class, and our textbook also contains this information.","We did a survey at the begining of the year that we still use for class examples.","This happened after the first exam. The professor told us to “ reflect on our study habits ” to see if they were effective or not based on our performance.","When the instructor has asked a question about the course instruction a student usually answers","The instructor allows us to solve problems in groups, thus encouraging that students should support and learn from each other.","Prof. [Removed] implements [Removed] [Removed] every now and then in lectures to check our participation and to get a general idea of how students are feeling about either the course or content.","[Removed]","They wrote this in our syllabus.

However, to be honest, that is not something I'm necessarily looking for. I'm there to learn the content.","She mentioned how different fields of science have different views on certain things. For example when we learned the quantum spin of electrons she mentioned how physicist might view the spin aspect differently. Furthermore she mentioned that in biology covalent bonds are in a different range of delta electronegativity than in chemistry.","During lectures, the professor would listen to student feedback regarding assignments or teaching methods if said students mentioned dissatisfaction.","I love that we have the 25 question types and a bunch of studying material such as practice questions and practice exams that allow us to prepare ourslves for the actual exam. I feel as though that s a more efficient way of preparing for bigger tests.","When working out a problem on the board he showed a common mistake that students make. This happened during lecture after a student asked a question. The instructor explained the right way to do it afterwards.","During the lecture, the Professor discussed how different perspectives in science contribute to new discoveries.   She mentioned something along the lines of, [Removed] is about more than just formulas — it's about how we approach problems differently. Every unique perspective can help us see something new, and that's where breakthroughs happen.","Last time we had to take a survey she described this exact thing. She also guaranteed that our work in this class would be helpful for our future and that she was building our skills.","Review guide for unit test, questions types for quizzes and exams","He would and is emailing students about seeking accommodations if we feel that we need them through the university. This would be before midterms. Emails detailing how to seek help in order to perform to our upmost ablilites.","On the syllabus the instructor has clear policies regarding missed assignments or exams to accomodate for life events.","In class we are doing experiments on soil bacteria and what happened was we had too see if there was some type of DNA in our soil bacteria. When this did not happen, the instructor explained to us that things like this happens all the time and her and he team are learning just like us students and that in labs like this we have to expect the unexpected and that is how we learn.","He always stays after class to answer questions and during office hours he does the same. He also encourages people to raise their hand in class if they have a question.","We used datasets relating to earthquakes to analyze in R studio, both for practice, but we were able to use actual, real - world generated data.","During discussion sections, Dr. [Removed]'s TA will provide us with a tailored set of practice problems made to emphasize what people struggled with on the last quiz. After a brief working period, [Removed] thoroughly explains each practice problem.","[Removed] was talking about life experiences as a student He did not do his best in college due to personal struggles but he overcame them to become a professor at physics ( which he failed before ). HIs experience was to highlight that we can always grow and that there are resources to help us out.","Just when we were discussing the process of spreading the solution on [Removed] plates, my TA said that this can be important if we want to do more research in the future.","Dr. [Removed] encourages students to reach out to instructors and instructor assistants if they are facing difficulties in and out of class. She does this several times a month and truly encourages students to reach out to herself.","This is what this course excells in. Every test we are able to earn back credit on exams by doing test corrections for half credit earned back. For example an 80 can become a 90 with thorough exemplification of test corrections. This happens any time between the midterm taken and the next midterm.","She mentioned office hours and academic communities that students could go to.","every lectured we get instapolls about current topics we are learning about in the form of multiple choice questions. he gives hints / advice if a lot of people are getting it wrong and gives us time think about it and get it right before moving on","Professor [Removed] gives us time to talk to our classmates about confusing concepts and then reclarifies the concept.","The professor always reminds that she has office hours and encourages students to go. If students are emailing a lot about an issue she will sent out an email to all the students addressing the problems.","Dr. [Removed] tells us as long as we practice, she is confident we are able to master concepts in her course.","Every week we have a quiz that we have the opportunity to resubmit. We ca take the quiz once, learn from any mistakes made, and then retake the quiz again for a better score.","Dr. [Removed] loves space, so he always tries to relate topics that we are learning about to space research.","The instructor has introduced us to her life outside of class when she talks about her interests and where she came from. This allows for a more personable connection to be formed since the lecture hall contains so may people.","Many resources on canvas when going through pre - labs \n","Does not pertain to the course. Gave us at the beginning of classes however it has deceased.","she reminds us daily that we are all learning physicists and is happy to see how much we are learning each day, even though it may not seem like a lot to us.","In class","I feel as though she says she is always open to us very often and she constantly is reassuring us. i feel this happens especially around tests","Multiple online polls daily of fundamental material to make sure we understand it.","He constantly makes sure to ask us how we feel about what's going on","Usually, as a method to encourage us, our professor would use herself as an example when she was studying chemistry like us. It helps a lot knowing that even the professors make mistakes.","We do instapolls all the time in class. Afterwards we go over the answers.","Instapolls allow for students to collaborate. Also gives us a chance to respond to each other.","[Removed] is a great teacher and has always made sure we are all on the same page with the material.   She checks in often to ensure we don't have questions or any confusion and if there is, she will stop and make sure we are caught back up with what is happening before moving on.","The professor makes assignments out of surveys like this to collect student feedback","Our professor has mentioned how everyone comes from different backgrounds and places, and that this is crucial to him while educating his students because everyone requires different learning methods.","This is evident when she discusses a topic in class, especially when her handwriting is difficult to read at times.","Yes, our set up allows us to collaborate in a small group all the time, we ask questions.","My instructor lets us talk to people beside us about a specific course question she asks us to answer. She lets us talk and work through the problem together. She gives us about 5 minutes to do this.","He asks us to define terms in our own words","For our learning modules, you get 3 attempts to complete it. So if you make a mistake and don't like your grade you have chances to improve it and the highest score is taken.","She talked about it","[Removed] / A","explained the resources on campus, [Removed] tutoring, etc.","I feel like it was referenced in relation to things like the use of certain words or the history on some experiments and why they are still in use.","She loves questions and encourages for students to always ask her anything no matter the questions. She also has many student hours dedicated to questions.","A couple of weeks ago, our lecture included a scientist and my professor went over the scientists findings because it was relevant to the lesson.","He gives us a prelecture assignment daily for the topic today.","During lecture, she makes sure to ask if we understand certain subjects before moving onto the next topic. She pauses, gives us time to think, then asks if we have any questions on the topic before moving on. If we do have questions, she does a demonstration and answers it clearly.","In active learning session, she always gives students time to think about the answer and share it with others","When doing practice problems, she makes sure that we can independently go through them and then with our groups, and then as a class","Tells us about how things go beyond college and into real world.","A lot of the example Dr. [Removed] provide could have multiple answer. The instructor also help us analyze and using the [Removed] method to come up with our answer.","She encourages students to use the [Removed] discussion boards to post the questions they are confused about. After looking at the board myself, I believe that questions are answered well and in a timely manner.","He has us use outside knowledge to apply to practice problems but guides us through it \n","Directed us how these topics apply to our daily lives \n","He asks theoretical questions during lecture that can have multiple correct answers or will also do it through square cap \n"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

really enjoyed the quiz format rather than multiple major exams. I feel that this is a lot more manageable.","My TA is really great and does a great job with what she can control. I know a lot of the course layout is not up to her, but the professor. I know that my TA cares about us doing well and learning. She also values our time, while also making sure we have a strong understanding of the experiments.","For me I think the fact that the professor is open to students making mistakes and helping us overcome those struggles has been refreshing. He is very helpful in office hours","I like how she brings her own failures and perspective of physics and learning into the classroom and makes us not feel alone if we are struggling.","The instructor teaches everything in a smooth but fast paced way that can be caught.","I like the way my professor teaches! I sometimes wish the in - class quizzes had more questions because there are usually 5 questions and if I miss one, I am at an 80.","I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. Some courses need to incorporate current pop culture or other niche references, but I feel like [Removed] doesn't have as much of a place for this.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor. She teaches the material well and cares for her students. If there is anything in this survey that I indicated she has not discussed or done, it is because this course is an introductory biology course and those topics simply do not come up.","I LOVE [Removed] [Removed] \n","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor and lecturer","No, that will be all.","I appreciate that Dr. [Removed] uses Instapolls as they encourage me to come to class so as to not miss any material, and I like being able to apply knowledge in real time and learn afterward if I made a mistake.","I wish the instructors were more active on [Removed] [Removed] I feel like I would post my homework questions there if I knew it would get responded to in a couple hours, but I understand Dr. [Removed] and the TAs have other classes, research, and personal lives and can't constantly tend to [Removed] discussion. It's just really frustrating to go approach a homework problem 4 different ways and it still be wrong and not know what to do.","Dr. [Removed] is the only professor i've had at [Removed] who has opened up to her students and made herself vulnerable about her failures. She has shown me and my peers that it is okay to fail in physics because failing is what leads to success. She has spoken about her experiences as a women in STEM and I love that I am able to relate to her. Dr. [Removed] is such a valuable professor and I know I can learn a lot from her.","My instructor is very kind and engaging and I love being in her class, but it is difficult and she moves really fast.","She is a great professor with a clear grading structure.","Not really, I don't have anything. Dr. [Removed] is a good professor once a freshman gets accumlated to college coursework. It may seem challenging, but Dr. [Removed] and her team really prepare everyone for the exams.","Dr. [Removed] provides extensions on assignments which has given me the time I needed to get my work done without rushing, this made the course a lot less stressful for me which is always appreciated. Overall her lecture is pretty good but sometimes she struggles to explain something clearly which can make getting a question answered difficult or confusing.","My instructor has a policy this semester where instead of dropping our lowest exam score, we are instead allowed to take a retake exam ( not exactly the same as the first exam, but quite similar ) one week after the original exam, testing over the same concepts. Everyone is eligible for this retake exam.","I would love to highlight that she truly cares about her students and takes extra time to ensure that everyone understands the material. She goes above and beyond by offering additional support outside of class hours, being approachable and patient, and making sure no one feels left behind. Her dedication is inspiring, and it makes a big difference in creating a positive learning environment.","He is so personable, and I really enjoy his class. My TA, [Removed], is incredibly helpful. She is AMAZING at her job, and I credit her with helping me get comfortable with college level biology.","The instructor has been very willing to help. She is great about checking in with students, keeping the pace of the class reasonable and providing students with valuable opportunities to learn and demonstrate their knowledge.","Overall, Dr. [Removed] is a great teacher! I like how she encourages collaboration instead of competition. This way, students don't feel anxious when asking questions. I also like how the teams can help us explain concepts to each other.","very kind professor. love how honest and open she is. very grateful to have such a humble professor who understands how different backgrounds can impact our previous knowledge and how there are barriers to entry in stem fields.","My instructor has made sure to teach the curriculum in a way to help everyone understand. The amount of resources provided for exams and in general study is very helpful.","No! She is wonderful","She is a good teacher but her writing isn't legible.","She's absolutely brutal when someone gets the question wrong that she asked. This girl answered it wrong and she was like' no, that's completely incorrect. \" Everybody I've talked to about it is like I'm never answering a question from her ever again because she was blunt as hell about it [Removed].","I like the structure of her class, and her learning modules are helpful. She offers a lot of good resources to help us succeed in the class.","She has a good amount of study resources and tries her best to make the class accommodating","Nope, thank - you.","[Removed] / [Removed]","So far, the class is rolling pretty smoothly and I have enjoyed it. I do not think there is anything I would change, even if there are a lot of assignments.","I really love how the instructor seems like she loves the content she is teaching.","Overall, [Removed] has been INSTRUMENTAL in my success in this course. She provided the course content in ways that were manageable and easy to digest.","not really, they're super supportive and amazing","Overall, the Dr. [Removed] seems to be one of the better, if not best options to take for engineering physics. I have heard that most of the physics professors at [Removed] are not great ; however, Dr. [Removed] seems to be a rare exception. He cares for his students, and he really wants to have as much of an open discussion and dialogue class as possible. Professors need to prioritize engaging their students over vomiting as much information onto them as possible, and Dr. [Removed] definitely does a great job of this.","I like how the lead instructor gives you optional practice so that students can choose their learning strategy.","I really liked the study guide and practice exams she offered to everyone for studying. I wish there were more questions on the practice exams to study. I don't much like the group projects. They seem a little out of the scope of the class in terms of data organizing and stuff like that. I feel like it's a little harder to do, but that just may be something she is doing to expose us to it. Also, she seems really kind which makes me want to listen and learn in her lectures more.","I would appreciate more practice problems and enhanced lecture slides that include annotated notes, which could significantly improve the learning experience. The current slides are somewhat basic and lack detailed explanations that could help clarify complex topics. Additionally, having access to a broader range of practice problems would allow for better preparation for exams and deeper understanding of the course material. This would not only aid in retention but also boost confidence in applying the concepts taught.","As a student who has difficulty concentrating on reading textbooks for long period of time due to [Removed], I really appreciate the diverse amount of resources that Professor [Removed] and her TAs put out such as the handouts and lecture slides. One slight change I might recommend is to have more visual resources such as helpful videos or diagrams that show how each concept relate to each other, but this is a minor concern since there are still many resources available for visual / auditory learners such as CSS and discussions. I also really appreciate the practice quizzes that Professor [Removed] puts out, since it helps me feel prepared for the quiz and motivated in the course, which is a big help for my perfectionism and anxiety over academia, especially since I have previously failed a biology course due to this.","Dr. [Removed] is the first professor I have had at [Removed] that is not afraid to talk about her past failures. I feel that she truly understands the struggles her students are facing and wants to help them as much as possible.","The practice exam for midterm 1 was easier than the exam. I would like a practice exam of the same difficulty as the exam.","I think the professor spends a lot of time on the easier topics and will blow over the more difficult parts. It can definitely be confusing to understand because she will often only teach the way she prefers but it is still a way to get it done. I also think the learning modules assigned are very, very long, it is content heavy which can make it hard to stay motivated. There are many TAs that walk around to answer questions. The professor also doesn't like for us to talk while she is lecturing, understandable but at the same time, it helps to talk with other students while we are being taught to fully grasp the content. In the end, it is just an introduction to [Removed] so it is going to be a larger class but I think there needs to be more understanding towards the student's side.","My professor does the best job at going through material with the time she has, so it is understandable if we go a bit quicker than other subjects. There is also a significantly high student to TA ratio, so there s oftentimes a lot of questions that go unanswered.","his lectures are informative but not super helpful for learning the material and making it stick but he does have a lot of questions to practice from","I am thankful we are encouraged to participate in class activities and instapolls to start applying about the material learned in lecture as soon as possible. This helps get a grasp on information better, or clarifies the material before trying to apply it to concepts in exams.","She is very nice and has a lot of resources for students who need extra practice for the exams or just over content.   This is very important for students because she even provides practice exams that are harder than the actual exam that makes students feel more comfortable and ready for the exam.   Only critique would be the learning modules, I would just like an announcement that there are more than usual learning modules to complete and when they are posted since some are posted later than expected.","This instructor does not like whispering in the classroom at all and said that she would refrain from giving us as much information as the other sections because of this.","I am really enjoying this class, and hope to see what the future leads to!","Not really, this class is pretty standard and doesn't require much involvement from diverse perspectives or whatnot, since its an analytics course. There are only so many ways different perspectives can perceive data.","Not really! I really enjoy Professor [Removed]'s class!","Nothing. She is just an amazing professor.","He just doesn't teach much and spends too much time on solving like one practice problem. Instead of just showing us how to solve it, he just does one little step and then gives like such a long pause trying to see if we could solve it, and by that time class is over and we've neither learned how to solve that problem or collaborated on it because no one else knows how to do it either. These long pauses and waiting for people to magically somehow figure out the answer is very irritating and does not help. He should just show us how to do the problems.","Our instructor has been nothing but nice and sweet to each individual student within the class. I would 100 percent retake this class because the class was very interesting and the instructor and student assistant was easy to work with and get along.","Not necessarily.","He is very welcoming and open to asking questions.","I respect [Removed]'s passion for creating a freshman - friendly course by providing many resources and even looking at tests on a case - by - case basis to get a look at the most accurate grading process in a class of over a hundred students.","Can we get more practice indicative of how the tests can be in class, and also more structured practices during discussion that doesn't seem so difficult, or has questions that build on each other to help develop a deeper understanding of the concept.","I like how much resources my professor gives me for the exams. I just wished she went more in depth with the lectures and doesn't just go over what's already on the slides. I feel like I always need to reteach myself what she taught during the lectures instead of her teaching me.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor. I find that I have understanding of new material just as rich as understanding I have of material I was refreshed upon.","I really enjoy the class format of asking students to also answer questions during class -- in general I find that engaging classes are the ones that I enjoy ( and do the most well in ).","I love the instructor and the TA! They are amazing people!","I like how Dr. [Removed] is open to answer as many questions she can in class, and after the class ends she always encourages people to come to her office hours if they need help.","We barely get any time to discuss topics among classmates in class and not a lot of time is spent going into depth on the materials. The class feels fast - paced. In order to properly prepare for class and learn the topics, I have to consult outside materials. Only then, am I able to see / understand the steps that go into solving a problem.","The instructor is really kind. I just feel like I'd leave lectures feeling confident about the material and then see the homework and be completely confused.","She is a great professor but when asking more advanced conceptual questions and multiple students answering the answer can get muddled when too many solutions are put out there.","I believe that the professor is great. She cares about her students and is always available to answer questions.","My instructor tries to make it a fun environment in such a big class size. It can also make it difficult to cater to a lot of students, so there are many resources that are provided to help us succeed.","When discussing questions about exams she is not as accommodating. Some questions I believe were unfair or not necessarily taught which I thought was not helpful or an accurate measure of mastering the content.","I wish that with the quizzes that the bank of questions was 30 max instead of around 80 when the actual quiz only utilizes 3 of those questions in total.","I think more guidance in taking notes in this class, and more structure on what is required to know and what is not required, that distinction will save a lot of students time and energy.","No there is nothing else.","Really like how Professor [Removed] gives us lots of example problems and helps us solve them in class. I also like how her class is very consistent and she tells us what to expect for the upcoming week through her announcements.","Let people whisper, we're trying to understand course material as the lesson goes on. It may be a little distracting, but its a way for us to understand during lecture.","[Removed] is definitely the best of the best! I really enjoy the seminars! They are super informative! Those life skills are definitely going to be valuable! It'll come in handy!","Professor [Removed] is an excellent professor. I really am enjoying her class.","She is really soft - spoken and students take advantage of that so the class is really loud at times and it is a bit distracting","He is just really energetic and he seems to enjoy what he is teaching and wants everyone to see how energy electrons and magnetism really applies to the real world that he does demonstrations in classes that are amazing","He provides a lot of extra credit which I feel helps most of the students.","Honestly, from past observations, a lot of office hours are hard to go to, like it's at inconvenient times and they get canceled and pushed back a lot when you try to make the time for it. Also, there are no practice exams or more practice to go from, the homework, square cap questions, and discussion worksheets are nice, but they make me feel unprepared for upcoming assignments.","Dr. [Removed] is comfortable with making jokes and laughing a bunch in class, which makes the learning environment feel so much more friendly.","[Removed] / [Removed] \n","He doesn't do much, he reviews the slides and adds a couple items of note that are not included on the slides or textbook, but the relevancy of said notes are unclear. Alongside this, understanding him is a challenge as a result of his accent, tone, and speed of his talking voice. I hear and fully understand every couple words, taking notes with this is more difficult than it should be as I often mishear and misunderstand what he says during lecture.","Office hours are really helpful.","I like that she is very engaged in teaching. She never goes off topic.","Dr. [Removed] makes class really fun. Love her demos","I find the instructor's style of lecture to be hard to follow and, at times, unhelpful. The flipped classroom model helps to give and understanding of the class materials going into the class, but further self - instruction is beneficial.","Professor [Removed] has been one of the best professors I've had so far. It is clear she cares about her students and the connections that she wants them to build. She gives us many opportunities to succeed, not wanting to let us fail / suffer from our mistakes. Rather, she allows us to make mistakes and grow / learn from them without fearing that we will lose points / get a lower grade. I love how she makes an effort to learn about her students and engage them in the material, as I think that helps the most with retention, as active participation in class helps information stick better. All in all, I wish I had a lot more professors like Professor [Removed], although I believe she is more capable to connect with her students than other professors due to the smaller size of her class.","he's just awesome","I really enjoy this class and it's been a great experience so far! I have learned a lot!","She does a great job!","Super considerate and genuinely cares about your learning and overall wellbeing inside and outside of class.","Like i said this is a very fast paced class that needs a lot of self teaching","No there is no extra information","For me, a lot of information is repeated to the point where I think it's redundant. However, many of my peers will ask questions that make it seem like they don't understand certain concepts. I might try and find more ways to explain each concept in the course in order to make teaching the material more efficient.","I just believe that for a difficult class, she tries her best to make students actually learn and essentially relieve their stress. Her grading policies are nice as well as her study sessions.","I do sometimes feel a bit lost in the class by the way the professor teaches. I feel that the topics are not very clear and there's not a good explanation as to why something works the way it does. Chemistry right now is my hardest class because it is difficult to understand the unit. The questions the professor asks are overall confusing and do not much information as to how to approach the question. I would enjoy more explanation on certain topics.","Dr. [Removed] is soft spoken and it kinda makes me drowsy lol.","Allow the TAs to walk around the class and answer questions. Post specific question types and have in depth review sheets.","She's very nice and has been a really good professor.","Sometimes the content is covered too quickly but the resources make it easier to cover outside of class.","I really love how organized this instructor is in terms of helping us prepare for exams.","No I don't think so I enjoy the way the structure of the course is and I enjoy all the instructors that teach this course. I feel each and everyone fo them add somthing different to this course and what we learn and talk about.","She has be the only professor I have had so far that acknowledges the mental struggles that students in stem majors face. Telling us constanly that it is ok to cry, and to feel like you aren't good enough, and to have imposter syndrome. she tells us that we are not alone and that these feelings are common, but she also motivates us with her success stories as a female physist.","The instructor is good over I have no complaints, I like the teaching style and the way the instructor handles class as a whole.","I really enjoy the flipped classroom style because I feel like when I do the homework before class I come into class knowing more and the concepts click better for me.","I think he is a very understanding professor, it is nice to have someone who believes that all his students are capable of succeeding. I do think he has a lot of knowledge on topics which can make it harder to understand when asking him a question because it can often lead to more confusion.","Most of my friends failed the first test despite having prepared well. I think the instructor might have covered more in - depth the sort of material which would be on the exam.","Overall I love the pace of the course and while I don't love writing, I like coming into class with an open mind ready to grasp whatever new concepts and perspectives lined up for me. This is also liley my most social class since I am given many opportunities to interact with my peers and discuss the material.","I appreciate all her emails and positive attitude when it comes to learning.","Overall, [Removed] Hall is a good instructor. Some of this didn't really apply because this course is a lab course, and doesn't have lecture times for it either. So the only content that is important in this course is what we deduce at the end of each lab after experiments. The instructor is very helpful during class, and seems to enjoy being a lab instructor.","I like how Professor [Removed] allows us to learn from our mistakes. This helps foster an inclusive and safe learning environment.","No, so far, the instructor is doing quite well in getting the material across and it's helpful","[Removed] / [Removed]","She is a good instructor, just sometimes difficult to follow exactly what points she is intending to get across.","Sometimes she is extremely fast paced and doesn't thoroughly explain some topics, assuming you already know it. While the information is on the learning modules, my biology class is set up the same way and my professor thoroughly explains things as if we haven't taken biology since high school ( which is true for both bio and chem ). I wish that sometimes she would ensuring she has time to cover all topics equally in class ( Typically rushing in the last 15 minutes ) Overall a good class that requires work, but it's obtainable to succeed.","Dr. [Removed] has been the perfect teacher for an intro chemistry class for me! She treats us with the respect of people / students learning at a higher level, but makes chemistry topics seem very simplistic / easy to grasp with her teaching style. She poses lots of questions to see if we are getting the material, which is very helpful in seeing the areas I need to improve in. She also never treats us as if we're dumb when asking questions and provides so many extra learning opportunities with her and her TAs' multiple kinds of office hours.","I appreciated how respectful my instructor was.","The current layout works wonderfully and helps to not put much stress on one's workload. It does extremely help that the deadlines are set for 11:59 PM or an hour before class and that quizzes are based on pre - labs so as to not overexert us.","I think he teaches very well, slowly, in an understanding and empathetic way. He does not shame any \" stupid \" questions, or when students get answers incorrect. In class we do a couple practice problems and then have more practice problems to do for homework. Some questions on the homework however, are difficult, so I wish that he could review those more in class or in a video recording instead of just during office hours since many of us can not make it to those timings. I also wish he could provide us with more practice problems besides the homeworks and exam reviews. On quest we can do more problems just with different numbers, but I would like wholly different problems so I can set up the questions in different ways.","She cares about her students and makes an effort to reach out if she sees that we are struggling in the class. I did poorly on my first exam and she reached out to offer support and encourage me to attend office hours so she can help me get on track for the next exam.","I am not a super fast learner, so I am not very comfortable with the in class quiz because the material is too new","The instructor has us collaborate with other students during class, and I find this helpful.","i really like Dr. [Removed] she is very kind and informative and explains material well.","Enjoys what he does and it has a positive impact on the learning environment","Whenever we made errors, she would always help us through it and made sure we did not feel bad. She helped to correct our errors and explained to us how we can prevent them in the future.","I love her energy and how passionate she is","I have already taken this class in high school and now taking it with a better professor has made the class so much easier and I understand the information now.","Dr. [Removed] is the nicest person ever","I think the professor is great!","He genuinely shows how much he likes physics in class and always listens to his students","I appreciate how the instructor reminds us about other resources we can use to help our understanding of the material.","Not at this time.","I like how Dr. [Removed] offers a variety of ways to study for the test, including the square caps and discussion section worksheets.","It was an open ended question for all so no one felt pressure to answer.","I really like how she structures the class with Instapolls and time to discuss with other students throughout the class. She's also very kind and understanding and it seems like she genuinely cares about our health and success.","Dr. [Removed] is a very friendly professor! If I have anything to add its that I wish he included more resources for exam preparation. \n","She encourages us to keep learning and keep our eagerness to learn about chemistry going. She reiterates mistakes on exams although feel devastating are ok, and normal. She encourages us to utilize re - take opportunities and try for better results. She encourages us to prove to ourselves that we can do it.","I feel like he approaches physics with the mindset that anyone can learn it. I really appreciate that. I feel like it can be really easy to get discouraged if you do not get something and everyone around you does. I like that he still tries his best to push everyone.","He gives us extra credits. This makes the course experience more positive.","I think doing a kind of surveys about what students are confused or how comfortable they are in an assignment about to later give them some more feedback.","I appreciate his flexibility and kindness","I enjoy the way Professor [Removed] gives us examples to practice on but often my brain does not work fast enough to answer the question on my own before she provides the answer. However, I understand that time is limited and their are specific topics she must complete to stay on track!","I believe the instructor is stated at the beginning that this was the first year teaching thermodynamics ( I might be making this up ) so some of the questions were hard to answer or not possible considering this fact.","I have always had very kind and wholesome interactions with Professor [Removed]. He makes me feel comfortable, and I always feel as though I understand what is going on in this course.","The instructor is extremely kind and understanding. She is always open to questions and always offers to help us in any way possible. I am really enjoying this class as a result, and I look forward to it every week.","She makes the class very engaging for all students.","She's been very supportive and is very nice. She wants her students to succeed and she's very easy to approach. I have never felt uncomfortable asking her questions.","One thing that Dr. [Removed] has repeated throughout the class that has lifted my spirits was saying that physics is a challenging topic to grasp, and that it is normal to struggle with concepts. However, he has offered extra help in the form of multiple sessions of office hours per week to the students that are truly struggling.","No, she is a great lab instructor.","Nope! Dr. [Removed] is a great overall person, and is someone that really cares for her students as well as the material taught.","I really like the instructor, but outside of her lectures, it does not feel as though there are enough opportunities to learn the content or supplement knowledge","He's a great professor!","Lectures are enjoyable through the use of many demos and instapolls where you can analyze the problems with your peers.","[Removed] / [Removed] \n","No, there isn't anything else I would like to share.","She gets into the lesson really fast, and I feel like I have to pay attention very well in class, or I will miss vital information.","I think his lectures are too fast paced to retain enough information. However, the TA led discussions are helpful.","Nope! I really appreciate Dr. [Removed] and all that he contributes to his class.","Even though there are so many people in the class, Dr. [Removed] tries her best to make sure every student gets the help they need.","My TA is extremely understanding of all issues and composes herself in a way that is commendable. I have nothing but positive thoughts about her and she does an amazing job.","No! I think [Removed] is super nice. I wish he did provide more materials that reflected the exams.","I really appreciate how Dr. [Removed] worries about his students. He asks them to reach for help whenever they need it, and he seems willing to guide students when they don't feel very good about their progress in the course.","My instructor is very positive and he always includes student in the class and makes it a very interactive experience. He makes the knowledgable course more enjoyable.","I feel confident in my ability to succeed in the course!","The [Removed] course is sometimes hard to navigate and the learning modules are only posted days before they are due rather than in the beginning of the semester or in a calendar","I think offering office hours, having a TA / LA's and having multiple practice questions has helped make Physics easier to tackle.","No, everything is good, just the tests are very hard.","Dr sata is super excited about the work that he has done but I don't love how we start a new chapter before the exam on the last unit has been done","I don't blame her for not doing most of this because the class is so large, it is just unrealistic.","Dr. [Removed] makes the class engaging and followable. He explains and addresses questions students have very well. The class is also entertaining with his humor.","I wish the practice questions were helping to the tests...","Keep up the good work and try not to let the whispering get to you too much since it distracts from class, I say that understanding the irony","Not all exam questions are not very similar to the homework, there are certain concepts that are hard to understand when not related to real life. However, her specific squarecap questions keep my attention on the lectures","I have nothing to share.","Professor [Removed] spent a lot of time making sure we understood the basic concepts before moving on to the more complex ones.","The professor consistently reaches out with empathetic announcements that make me feel less alone in my struggles.","At times it seems like important information is said so fast that I can not write it down or type it fast enough. It could be helpful to repeat key ideas so there is time to absorb it.","I really enjoy when professors do practice problems from the homework.","[Removed] / [Removed] Just an overall great person with a passion for teaching and a big heart.","I think Dr. [Removed] does a great job of explaining things in a way that feels approachable in class. He also makes use of the time to encourage us to discuss possible answers and come to our own conclusions.","I overall like the internal structure of the course","I would have enjoyed going over the learning modules in lecture instead of it being self - taught","I think Dr. [Removed]'s class has a fair amount of course work, and the way he teaches make the material easy to understand.","Dr. [Removed] is very patient with us, and it is evident that she wants us to understand the material. It is also obvious that she enjoys what she does. Even though her class is at 8 am, she makes jokes to keep us engaged. Her office hours are great as well. She acknowledges every person and encourages them to ask questions. She also encourages us to work together during office hours. She is always validating us by saying the material can be challenging, but she provides us with the way she would approach the problems. I truly believe that Dr. [Removed] cares about her students.","Professor is very open to questions and helpful in understanding difficult topics. She is usually in a pleasant mood despite it being 8:00am.","The TA has been very helpful and informative throughout the semester.","He is very nice and open to people asking him questions.","I liked having practice exams. It was useful in preparing for the actual exams.","Sometimes it gets hard to follow her during lectures because she would explain a concept and suddenly bring in a different topic that we would learn about the next lecture day ; however, it's nice for her to give us a sneak peek of the next day's topic, it's just that because of the fast - paced nature of this class and the amount of new material we have to learn, it gets difficult to follow. \n\n Regardless of that, I like how she teaches the course material and I also greatly appreciate the practice problems that she does on the board since it makes it easier to understand the concept. Additionally, it's nice how she brings in material from past units to show how everything relates to one another.","I really enjoy Dr. [Removed]' classes. Her classes are one of the few that I feel like I actually learned from because she uses active learning and she provides us with the proper materials to study for exams. I can tell by the way she teaches that she is passionate about helping others learn and sharing knowledge. Even if her classes make you put in a little more effort than others, I think the output of the course is much greater than most.","Most of the topics previously mentioned do not refer to the lab setting of [Removed] Lab, in which the instructor mainly acts as a loose proctor within experiments rather than an actual lecturer or provider of information.","I appreciated the reflection","She is doing a great job at teaching physics, I can understand the concepts that I am supposed to learn from the way she lectures. I myself am unsure how some of the questions in this survey can be relevant or implemented into a physics class, but I tried to answer the questions to the best of my ability.","I like that Professor [Removed] is really enthusiastic about this field of physics, it also helps that she's pretty funny ; she's often cracking jokes that make the whole lecture hall giggle, and I think it helps lighten up the mood and helps the space feel more humane, I suppose. This is unlike other physics classes, where the professor is painfully serious all the time, which makes the class that much harder.","Thank you for being so open to improvement and really care about your students! I really appreciate it and that's the kind of teacher I want to be.","I think this class is very informative on expectations and the level of coursework required. This helps us all to understand what is expected of us and how our research applies to work done in everyday research in higher organizations.","Dr. [Removed] is very nice and will not discriminate anybody on their smarts ; she is a great teacher and doesn't shy away from any questions.","I am very happy and excited about the way this course is structured! Thank you!","The instructor was incredibly helpful during student hours, patiently going over homework problems, which made me feel more confident and supported in mastering the material. \n","[Removed] / A I believe my instructor is doing a wonderful job at interacting with students and teaching the material","I think so far in my academic journey, Professor [Removed] course policies are the best. There are few difficult things for me that I would like to be addressed. For example, I'm a commuter student. I drive from 1hr everyday to get to campus. I wish If there was way for me to still participate in the class without having to show up to campus every day because frankly its very tiring to drive every day for an hour to get to campus. Perhaps lectures online or online zoom availability for commuting students can be a great thing.","The instructor was always receptive to questions and always assured us that if we ever had any concerns, we should communicate them.","Suffering through the class because the test doesn't really reflect what you learn since your grade can go down with a simple mistake on a conceptual questions","que asking question to her it makes you feel as if you should already know the answer","She is a very nice instructor who encourages group work and hands - on learning!","There are plenty of resources for this class that I appreciate greatly ( the \" [Removed] discussion \" tab on [Removed], plenty of office hours, access to prerequisite materials, and more ). My favorite of these resources is the exam preparation tab. I love the question types and the review notes based on them because I know what is expected of me and if I need more help in a certain subject.","Not really just that she's a great instructor.","None that stand out to me","I think that the study guide materials are extremely helpful and beneficial.","Performed experiments in the beginning of the course helped me and other students pay attention to the topic at hand.","My professor releases practice exam questions that help ALOT during exam season!! His homework accurately reflects his exams, so it's easy to prepare for the exams.","Great class! Professor [Removed] helps make it easy to understand and wants his students to learn and succeed.","She's a great instructor and her class is really enjoyable.","Not really. Dr. [Removed] seems like a good professor.","I think Dr. [Removed] does a fantastic job at presenting the material needed for class and allowing enough time for in class practice and discussion.","She is very empathetic and humble. She is extremely relatable and kind.","Dr. [Removed] make the classroom experience great!","Loveridge is a chill guy, would recommend to my friends for PHY303 K","I like how she has quiz reflections that help us earn back points","She is very caring and knowledgeable. She cares about students and wants them to succeed in her class. She's happy to answer the questions that we may still have after class, and she emphasizes the growth mindset and discussion with peers to talk about the problems before going over in class together.","Something I admire a lot in teachers is someone that encourages improvement and learning. In this course so far we are allowed 2 attempts on quizzes which is great since it allows for improvement instead of punishing not succeeding the first time around. I also like that homework is graded on effort, it pushes me to produce the best quality submission I can while not punishing a student if they are wrong. When a course is too strict with grading I find the students within it feel very negative about the material and may even resort to cheating, but when effort is considered more I see people keep trying and be genuinely engaged in the material.","I really enjoy how Dr. [Removed] stays after class to answer questions, but sometimes I find it difficult to keep up with the lecture if I do not have previous knowledge in the content from highschool. While I am grateful that he expresses that he covers content other professors do not in his field at this level, it would be more helpful to slow down in learning this more advanced content to understand the topics deeply.","[Removed] professor. STEM classes are hard [Removed] they are mostly exam based and I am a horrendous exam taker, but i enjoy physics and Dr. [Removed] is my top prof for any of the STEM classes I've taken that I am not remotely confident in.","No, I believe I added all that I needed to add.","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind instructor who genuinely cares about her students. She sends out encouraging messages that help me feel better about the difficulty of learning genetics and helps to encourage me to continue. However, because of the limited amount of time during class, it can be hard to get clarifications on questions and lecture materials because there's only so much time we can spend on them. This leads to questions not being fully answered on our practice problems on [Removed].","I like that the instructor prepares us well for an exam by giving us plenty of practice through learning modules and practice exams. i really like that the instructor allows us 3 tries on the learning modules, and I feel that I score better due to the lack of pressure to do well. When I get something incorrect, I take the opportunity to learn the concept better rather than rushing quickly to get a good grade, as there are very low stakes. However, I wish the weekly quizzes were more flexible, and I wish it could be a better learning opportunity. If I get something wrong, I don't go back and correct my mistake as I feel unmotivated. However, If there were better opportunities for the quizes, I think I would score higher and also learn better.","Not really, [ retty standard teaching stile. Is very engaging and supportive.","I believe Mrs. [Removed] has promoted an environment where students are able to succeed, given the plethora of test - prep resources and re - assessment opportunities. This creates a culture where students are eager to learn and grow intellectually, not just within the class but even across campus.","She is very approachable and goes over things we are unable to understand","Sometimes I feel a little overwhelmed by the amount of stuff we have to know and I have been struggling a little bit.","She is a good professor considering the large lecture hall. I wish she'd teach faster and actually get through all the material.","Dr. [Removed] handles the course well considering its size.","[Removed] / [Removed]","Dr. [Removed] is a good instructor, who wants all her students to succeed. With office hours, discussion sections, [Removed], and weekly homework, she sets us up for success.","Being open - minded and listening to what we had to say about the confusing exam question then promptly discussing it to the whole class the same day and giving us points back made me feel like he cares. He seems more approachable now and I feel like going to more office hours could be good learning","She doesn't stop to answer questions, now I understand we have TAS and a short time. I feel the class would be so much more enjoyable if she answered students questions during lectures.","I like the structure of the course, the expectations are clear and the exams are designed well in a way that makes it easy to do well as long as you put in the work.","I feel comfortable bringing up questions / concerns I have with her. I appreciate that it feels like a casual interaction with no judgement.","She is down to earth, and will tell you what you need to know in many different ways so that if you are even half way awake you will get what you need to know, and so that makes me feel like I can do well in the class. It is quite frankly incredible, the effort she puts in.","Prof. [Removed] is a good physics teacher","The instructor recently has been stopping class and pausing her lectures because people are whispering, which is frustrating especially because most of the time its about the course. She states that its disruptive to the class, but in truth I find it more disruptive in her stopping her lectures to point out this than the whispering itself.","She is a very nice professor, and although she is sometimes very pushy about people participating during class ( I am too nervous to do so ), I appreciate her effort in having a more interactive class.","I would just like to say that the way he holds his lectures into questions is good and effective to me at least as it helps me utilize what I learned. This helps me remember it better for exams.","Dr. [Removed] is a caring and thorough teacher. Even though, she rushed a little to complete the material prior to the exam, the [Removed] Discussion, review notes, and practice exams are great study resources and reflect what to expect on the exam. Her slides in class are also great!","The showing of images before every lecture whether it is a recent discovery or part of his own research is such a small detail that makes every lecture better. Takes some stress off and helps us realize that we're all important to achieving evolution as a species and that anyone can do it.","Dr. [Removed] is very caring and understanding. She emphasizes mental health and provides a safe environment to learn physics.","No they are all very good.","I think Dr. [Removed] did an excellent job on making us feel comfortable and positive with the material. She reminds us that it's okay to make mistakes and is always motivating us for the future.","Dr. [Removed] does an amazing job making sure each student understands and gets lots of practice.","She's really nice but it condescending sometimes when people ask questions. She'll ask us if we have any questions and he first response is well did you read the textbook if you reply yes then she goes well it's really easy. Then proceeds to answer your questions. Other than that she is kind and willing to help but when you get talked to like that it makes you feel like you can't ask questions.","I don't like how [Removed] is constantly reviewing content rather than teaching at times. Also, during the week of exams, he is teaching new content while students are focusing more on exams which means a lack of learning. The grading curve could also be improved a lot of the time.","While working on handouts both the professor and teaching assistant will go around the class to help out one on one with things we are having difficulty with.","She is greattttttt!!","I think the ability to do test corrections and get points back on exams is extremely beneficial to my experience in the course. I feel it allows me to stress less and it also ensures I learn the material.","I think she could be a little bit more encouraging during class and give out more words of encouragement.","His general demeanor is very welcoming and respectful. He seems to understand very well what it is like to be a student","I went to office house to ask about a missed question on a test and my professor explained and then praised me about my grade overall.","He a great professor.","I have not heard it said during class, but I am sure he does","There is nothing else I would like to add.","The class is just very large and virtually impossible to know everyone on a personal or even name basis, but this is definitely made up for by the TA's in the discussion section. If you have a good TA you are more likely to be better prepared when the exams come around.","The resources he provides us with before exams are helpful. He tells us what concepts we need to know.","Dr. [Removed]'s class is huge so I don't have the chance to get to know her personally but I know she is very cool and fun anyway. I really like how organized this course is despite the class size which I why I think Dr. [Removed] is a great instructor.","I love that Professor [Removed] gives half the points back on the exams. It helps me stay calm and less anxious when I take the exams, which ultimately makes me do better. I also think it establishes that students are more than just their test scores and builds a healthy relationship with learning. I think this shows how Professor [Removed] cares about the well - being of his students.","Not at the moment","I would prefer if Dr. [Removed] worked on some difficult questions with numbers in class rather than mainly conceptual problems. Practicing with harder questions would make the homework a bit easier as well as exams. Using numbers as well will allow us to practice what an actual physics problem is like.","I appreciate how approachable the instructor is and how he takes each inquiry into deep consideration. He doesn't ever make students feel stupid for asking questions, even if they may be simple.","She's a great teacher!","I really like Dr. [Removed]! He was made for teaching [Removed].","No, this class is great as it is currently.","I reccomend taking more questions out of the textbook and explaining what sections would be most useful for the next lecture so students can get another chance to understand the material. Besides that, it's good to always encourage discussion and have students answer each other's question so they can flex their knowledge regarding the question or subject.","No! She is a great instructor.","I appreciate how this class encourages students to do well. [Removed] has the reputation of being difficult to pass, but our professor has done a good job making it seem less intimidating. Through the test preparation files and all of the extra support that we have, I feel confident in my ability to pass this class, and even get an A!","I appreciate that the instructor makes an effort to discuss with students during lectures ( through lecture handouts to be done in groups ), rather than simply talking / lecturing at us.","Dr [Removed] is an okay professor, I feel like the course is more self paced. There is little interaction or enthusiasm during lecture and very little encouragement of discussing the content with other students. Compared to other classes, like my [Removed] [Removed] class, I am more excited to learn because the content is taught in an engaging and important way. Most of the time the information presented in class is just read off slides and I could do that on my own.","All instructors are supportive and encouraging","Not much. Dr. [Removed] is a solid professor.","He is a great teacher","I like how he focuses on growth mindset and encourages it.","The instructor typically encourages us in class to work in groups which is nice because it fosters a communicative work environment.","I like how Dr. [Removed] likes to share aspects of her life and always asks who we are doing / have been at the start of each lecture.","I enjoy that he is so relatable! He doesn't want anyone to be nervous or embarrassed.","She makes learning in her class feel safe. Not only does she help correct common mistakes during lectures, but she also implies and emphasizes ideas to ensure understanding of the concept.","I think that this was not done because there is a little bit of a curve in her grading method regarding the exam ; however, she mentions that we can use our first exam ( in this case, since we barely took our first one ) as a way to assess our study strategies, which can help in the future.","Dr. [Removed] is incredibly caring and kind. She makes her students feel cared for and prioritizes learning over earning high marks on assignments. She reminds students to take care of themselves and to never be afraid of asking questions or making mistakes. I can always look forward to class because of her!","He is very good at explain ideas with visuals and areal world examples, especially the demos. He has shockingly good comedic timing when appropriate, such as when a demo fails, but it is never intrusive or distracting, more - so one or two good comments per class that keep it lively.","He is a very nice professor ; he listens I can tell he is passionate about what he is talking especially when a student ask him something that he really can't explain in a bit.","She is extremely flexible and makes me feel comfortable in class even though physics is out of my comfort zone.","I like that Professor [Removed] uses in class experimental data to prove a certain topic that we're learning because it makes me actively participate instead of just being told that something is correct just because some said so. This really helped my understanding of the material.","It frustrates me that the slides in the lecture materials are not the same slides you show during the lecture- I know it is not all that important but I would like every piece of information I can get.","She makes small talk with us and cares to try to learn our names which I find super sweet and it also keeps me engaged in class because I feel like I am heard in the classroom.","I have enjoyed the class so far, but I do feel the most recent lecture over [Removed] ~ N ( 0,1 ) and normal distributions was very fast... I'm sure well continue to learn the material, but it was the first time I have had any confusion in the course. Overall, it has been a very good experience and a wonderful professor.","Maybe ask if we understand before moving on since the material moves along very quickly \n","I think this class if very interesting and thorough, but sometimes there is too much work that doesn't seem necessary. For example, some of the research reports and prelabs I think take up too much time and have us spend that time on something that isn't as important or useful to what we're doing. It's also a lot of work for a 2 credit course.","I would say that in general the instructor is very eager to help us learn and creates many opportunities for help if we don't understand something in class.","I like that she does the muddiest point analysis because it is really helpful that she re - teaches those harder topics on a deeper level.","I do not like how our instructor is inconsistent with the amount of time spent on each slide. It feels like the material is being rushed toward the end of class.","[Removed] / [Removed]","No! Dr. [Removed] is great though. Very lucky to have her as my physics professor. Other professors should look up to her in terms of teaching methods and encouraging students.","Sometimes I'm not sure what exactly I'm meant to learn in the class. Our instructor sets up learning modules, which she says are only meant to pique interest for the lecture, yet I learn more material from these than from the lecture. In these learning modules, there also are many links to outside sources, and it is unclear how far I should dive into each topic ( what is necessary, what is optional ).","Dr. [Removed] always tells her students about opportunities outside of academia- this includes orchestra concerts, food truck locations, and so much more! Dr. [Removed] truly reminds students that she is also a human and relates to us, whenever I speak to her I just know that I am accepted and appreciated.","She will ask the TA's to NOT answer question while she lectures. Then why are they there!???","I have thought that this class has been a great opportunity to develop a new set of skills and has been effective at helping to teach me to apply concepts in kinematics.","She always posts learning modules on canvas so we can do them before class and get a better understanding of the material before lecture.","The instructor creates a very good learning environment, but I wish that he would assist more on preparing us for the test.","I really liked talking about the applications of what learned in class. In addition whenever I ask a question the professor always makes it feel like a valid question.","professor [Removed] seems to really care about her students and encourages us to keep trying even when things feel hard, which is highly valued","I think it will be great for the Lab and HW keys to be released after grading is finished to see our mistakes and what we could improve on as students.","I don't think so.","So far, I love Professor [Removed]'s class! I used to hate chemistry in high school, but her class has been really fun as she teaches the concepts really well. The learning modules are super helpful too!","He encourages us to ask questions, even if the questions are not the most on topic question. This makes me more willing to ask questions because I know he wants us to learn as much as possible from his class.","I might be mistaken, but in the instructor's syllabus, it doesn't seem like he added information concerning mental health, but this does not mean that he does not support the aid thereof.","No, I don't have anything else to add. [Removed] is an amazing professor.","I just feel like she goes to fast through her lectures.","She has been very sweet, understanding, approachable and made my first lab less underwhelming. I also had to miss many labs due to illness and she was understanding and made the experience very low stress.","[Removed] cut course for the most part, but would be nice to have a better understanding on how assignments are graded.","I love Professor [Removed], as she's a great person and very knowledgeable, but she sometimes teaches very fast and doesn't account for students to not fully grasp a topic. Even if a few students understand a topic she moves on.","I hope the instructor could upload the worksheet key after she's done with talking about all these. I think it would be better for me to review the materials before something new comes.","having more practice problems that are similar to test questions would help me understand concepts.","[Removed] / [Removed] \n","She's been a great professor who cares a lot about her students' progress.","Not particularly. It's a great class but I'm not sure if that's due to her being an amazing teacher or simply because of how the course is structured ( not sure how much control she has over that I suppose ). Either way, I am very happy with this course and would recommend to anyone who needs a science course ( if not already a requirement for their major ).","Na, I really enjoy Dr. [Removed]'s class","This class is very well structured.","I think that the instructor is really good and wants the students to succeed in class.","Exam was not fun.","Professor [Removed] is definitely an excellent educator, and it is clear that he is passionate about the material he teaches. My only complaint with the course is that the homework assignments often do not match the material learned in class, and more classtime could be dedicated to preparing for and understanding the homework.","Even though I overlooked the focus on learning objectives at first, when it came time to studying for the test, this was a very useful criteria to look for in my exam preparation and helped me adequately realize what concepts I needed to spend more time with.","I think there needs to be in person review lectures weekly","He says that time spent \" complaining about homework \" is better spent elsewhere. However, I don't think he realizes how difficult his homework questions are for someone who has not taken physics recently -- or at all.","I wish he would emphasize more in depth what we should review from the slides","The graduate TA is great, there just isn't much opportunity for them to implement what was previously asked about.","Something that I appreciate is that our professor understands our situation as a student. In the syllabus and on the first day of class setting expectations, she mentioned how she values progress over perfection. This was really important to me because it can be hard to aim for perfection especially at a higher education level. However, with the help of others that this course provides I feel more open to learning and not closed off. It's okay to make mistakes and it's valuable to learn what learning styles / studying techniques are the most beneficial to you. As I go into college, I have learned a lot about myself and this course has made me feel more comfortable in adapting to the change.","Your lectures are fantastic but so quick! I envy the way we can fit so much information in such little time ; however, at first this was a difficult adjustment. I can say that a lot of this is learning on our own, but if people listen to lectures and are willing to ask questions, it's greatly helpful. I appreciate you for answering all our questions and giving little tidbits of information to us!","Yes, Dr. [Removed] is a very upbeat type of person who brings energy into her lectures. She keeps the people in her lectures involved by constantly having us talk to each other about problems that are on the screen.","The only thing that made this class difficult was the style of the lecture which often felt slow at times and didn't always follow along with the learning modules ( sometimes would touch on material not yet administered via learning modules ). Additionally, the pacing of the lectures would lead to the professor rushing through numerous slides within the last minutes of the class, impending my ability to actually take anything away from the lecture. Apart from this it's very clear the professor wants her students to succeed and gives a multitude of resources to make this a realistic possibility, and I very much appreciate it.","He does really well advertising his office hours. I've been wanting to attend but unfortunately I do have work and other classes that get in the way","Everything is good!","I think that Professor [Removed] does a great job of trying to help students truly understand the topics covered in this class without emphasizing studying to the exam. In my opinion, I think that the course would be a little better is Professor [Removed] went a little slower and tried to simplify the content to help us grasp it better.","no there is not","No, but overall they were great and understanding.","Not really. I like this class and am learning a lot.","I really like how Professor [Removed] has organized this course. Since the exams are not high stakes, I feel less pressure to be perfect and am able to focus on understanding the material and appreciating it.","My instructor is great, she provides a lot of information and source for us to do good in this course. \n","I really like this course and feel like it's an effective and great way to get people more involved in research. However, there does seem to be a lot of busy work but I understand the point of most assignments.","Posting learning modules the night before a lecture is a bit stressful, as it does not give me enough time to complete material that is significant to understanding the lecture the next day","Dr. [Removed] is extremely kind and caring. She makes sure we all get rest, are in a good mental state, and ready to learn.","When the class begins I feel we are there to learn, as in listening to her talk about the material, and that's it. When she hears any kind of whispering she says come on guys let's come back I don't have the energy for this or my throat is not up for the whispering guys. Most of the time when she says this I can't hear the whispers she is referring to and it kind of makes me feel like we can't talk about anything at all or she will get mad.","I wish she would spend more time fully explaining topics as if we have no prior experience, rather than just brushing over it slightly and teaching things as if we already know what we're doing. Even though we have learning modules, I learn better when I'm being taught in person.","I like that he encourages us to work with people near us when answering questions during lecture/","No, nothing specific","My instructors have been very nice and helpful. [Removed] also plays music in the background while we work. Her music taste is a little generic but I'm not complaining.","I wish Dr. [Removed] spent more time sharing how concepts connect across the unit and across course content. During his lectures, he often just reads the slideshow which has minimal information on them to begin with. I feel like the lectures would be more beneficial if they followed closer to what would be asked on the squarecaps and exams.","She's very nice and very approachable which is important for a professor. She's extremely willing to help and support her students, which not all professors display","I think she is doing her best! It's hard with a subject that complicated with so many people and you tell that she has good intentions.","Dr. [Removed] is a very positive person who is great at breaking down problems to a more manageable bite. Additionally, his emphasis on an open mindset helps support students through the hard parts of the course.","Not at the moment","He would often talk students through common misconceptions in interpreting how physics works and this has been exceptionally important to me. I'm not someone who understands physics well and having someone talk to me explaining why I have misconceptions about a concept and why the correct method is correct has been extremely useful.","I think [Removed] is very knowledgable in his field. What he does that is very nice is he shared research opportunities, which is very important for people like me in pre - med that are looking for research opportunities.","The instructor is very friendly, positive, personable, and understanding. Her courses focus on being able to apply data science and work through inevitable roadblocks. I enjoyed a past course so much that I chose to take her class for data science as well.","Dr. [Removed] often encourages students to ask questions when they are not understanding the topic. However, sometimes the way she responds is simply restating the question / doesn't provide more details / implies that the student should have already know it.","I like the overall structure of the course, having the same format of assignments, but building upon them every week in preparation of our final research poster presentation!","The main instructor has been extremely helpful and clear with directions when necessary.","My instructor is very helpful when it comes to the many curiosities a first - year college student may have.","The pace of the units that we've covered has been very unbalanced. It felt like we had an abundance of time for our first unit, but our second unit feels rushed.","He is a great professor and my only suggestion is expand a little deeper on the material and not just give charts and say know this material.","no I think she is great","Overall, Dr. [Removed] is an excellent professor and he is extremely helpful during office hours. In class, he goes over the material in a way that students can understand. Overall, he made my experience in the course so far a positive one.","She is a great professor and   teaches in the best way possible","The quizzes are easy to understand and she goes over everything that will be on the quizzes and posts reviews and practices which is very helpful.","Very helpful with helping us understand the big picture of why we are doing what we're doing.","Our lab TA speaks in term that are easy to understand and does not use strange scientific jargon when giving us directions. [Removed] also tries to interact with each student individually so we feel comfortable in the lab.","Keep up the great work!","She is the best, allows people to redeem themselves","I would like it if we had more opportunity to work together.","When Dr. [Removed] and TAs hold extra student hours it is very helpful especially on the days leading to an exam. It's also helpful that Dr. [Removed] records her student hours as some students can not always make it to student hours.","The instructor is very nice and tries to remember students' names. She genuinely wants to bond with students.","I believe that Professor [Removed] does a great job in regard to resources outside of class, such as academic communities and Friday recitations. I greatly appreciate the current grading structure of the course, as it encourages us to reattempt and grasp concepts, even if it doesn't come easily the first time. I do wish that the learning modules were discussed in class a bit more, bridging what we learn outside of class to relevant examples in the lecture. I also think that if more time was given to work out examples during class, I would feel more confident in my understanding of a specific concept outside of class.","The instructor is good at teaching just talks too fast and doesn't provide as much detail in lectures. Lectures like already know the concept.","My instructors have been incredibly patient with my adaptation to university life. This includes the acceptance of my late work and being easy to contact in case I need to submit something later.","Dr. [Removed] is a big fan of the growth mindset and I appreciate that he acknowledges that physics can be difficult for some students, but you can still learn and become proficient at it.","I love Professor [Removed]! She reminds me of a mother figure because she is just so caring towards all her students. I also love the classroom textbook we are currently using... it is very helpful for the class. Dr. [Removed] provides countless resources for all her students and much flexibility within her course. \n\n  Sometimes, however, I have a difficult time comprehending the lectures(not because of the professor ), simply because I am a slower learner. I will sometimes compare myself to my classmates and wonder why am I not able to keep up with them. The [Removed] can be difficult for me to understand, so I sometimes just go with what answers my friends pick. But that's okay, I know that this is just part of my learning how to study in college. In AP [Removed], I only relied on memorization. In this class, there is a much higher need to understand, and I am still working to adapt to that. \n\n I'm hoping that in the future, Dr. [Removed] could make attending class optional. I feel a high level of responsibility to attend all my classes ; however, in genetics, I struggle to comprehend the lectures. What I prefer to do is self - study the textbook, attempt the problems on my own, and then watch the recorded lecture. I feel that the class lecture makes me more overwhelmed since I know that I won't be able to understand it so clearly. However, I am currently working on a new method of reading the textbook chapters before class so that I can continue to go to lectures. We'll see what works better! :) \n\n That is my input for the class itself ; Professor [Removed] is perfect, and I wouldn't change anything about her!","Although the shear amount of homework can seem intense, I think that the professor is doing a good job to make a notoriously difficult class quite friendly.","I thought that the instructors were incredibly helpful when it came to making the students feel understood and engaged in class.","i love the way the new chemistry classes have been formatted.","She has seemed so caring and supportive throughout the past month and definitely emphasizes the importance of mental health and sleep which has made me feel like she genuinely cares and sees me as more than a student!","The course is extremely fast paced, it typically takes me between 48 and 96 hours to fully grasp the material. Quizzes occur on a weekly basis every Wednesday ; I had even 24 hours more to review the [Removed] before the next quiz I would understand it so much more. Because the content slides aren't posted in advance, there's no way to review early.","She is a great professor and has one a fantastic job teaching the course. Her student hours are extremely helpful whenever I needed help. Her TA, [Removed], is also a very helpful resource, especially with the weekly discussion sections.","I really love Dr. [Removed].   I think he cares a lot about his students doing well and is very passionate about teaching.   I also hope to LA for him in the future because he's reignited my passion for physics.   I wish all the best to him!","I think Dr. [Removed] does a great job of fostering an inclusive learning environment. The flipped classroom takes a bit getting used to, but with the right discipline, likely leads to better learning outcomes than a traditional classroom.","Dr. [Removed] is great! She's honestly very motivating, supportive, empathetic, and truly wants her students to succeed. I only wish she explained her lectures in more detail. Because of COVID-19, not all students have the strongest background in chemistry. It kind of feels like she just skims the slides during the lecture, so I find myself having to do a lot of self - teaching.","The instructor did a great job at teaching chem and being helpful.","I like how he is super open to questions and how he uses visual experiments to give real world examples of physics ideas.","The lectures are nice but I often feel somewhat unprepared for the test even though I've used all the resources given, including active recall.","I like the class and teacher but the course organization leaves something to be desired. It is a very non - linear class with a lot of jumping around and finding different resources to learn things. I would prefer a more cohesive method ( like maybe a textbook?? ) rather than the curriculum which I feel relies on canvas too heavily and is disorganized for someone not already familiar with the material.","The only thing is that I got [Removed] and had to quarantine for a whole week, but I still had to sacrifice my free absence days even though I wasn't allowed to be in class, otherwise I would get others sick. I believe that for medical reasons, even if we have allowances for missing class, it should not consume these days in case you have a personal emergency etc.","she constantly tells us its [Removed] to not be good at physics right now and that its OK to feel not good enough and that we can all improve she js a girl boss","  I am having a difficult time in this class because I feel like it is so hard to do well on the tests. Since they are only 12 question multiple choice, if you miss 1 question you're already at an A- and if you miss 2 questions you're at a [Removed] I think in the future, it would be a lot more beneficial to students if the tests included more problems so there is more room for error. In addition, I think more practice problems similar to what will be on the test would be helpful to students as well.","The demonstrations and examples given in lecture are beneficial in helping me to connect the ideas and concepts that are taught in lecture to a real life experience. Furthermore, the questions given in lecture are challenging, yet provoke thought and allow me to reinforce the concepts that are being introduced","There is not anything I can think of right now.","Some of the material feels rushed, it makes me feel anxious and feels like I need to rush through the information to be able to keep up with what is going on in class.","[Removed] genuinely wants us to do the best we can and has the best demos to make lectures interesting to help us. The only thing is that I wish he would spend less time deriving equations so that we could do more complicated examples in class because the homework and the exams are much harder so being able to go through them in class would be nice.","I can tell how much effort has gone into setting up the curriculum for this class! And prof. [Removed] is so kind and patient :)","I have enjoyed the class so far, although I would like to do less practice problems during class and be shown more instruction before working independently. I also have difficulty with the lab assignments and R programming language, so I would appreciate more instruction on that.","The questions on the weekly quizzes are worded really confusingly.","Throughout [Removed] School, [Removed] was something I struggled with. Going into [Removed] now, I was very nervous. However, Dr. [Removed]'s is an incredible professor, and she has helped me understand [Removed] on a level I previously deemed impossible.","She is always very kind and happy to answer any questions I am curious about and it makes ecology fun to learn.","Dr. [Removed] is super interactive and a great professor! She makes a very hard class enjoyable and even when times are tough, I know she believes that I can succeed!","The instructor may not be clear and sometimes have a hard undertstanding but the TAs are resourceful","Sometimes I feel that the lectures don't exactly match up with what is on the homework, as people often ask a bunch of questions that aren't related to the topic, which often leads to tangents unrelated to the content.","The instructor has greatly contributed to my success in this course.","She is a very caring and engaging professor that I am lucky to have.","I think the teacher is good at maintaining the learning environment by ensuring that the class stays quiet.","She really loves to respond to [Removed] discussion questions about course content very thoughtfully. All her posts have some sort of extra material whether it be a picture or links to related resources, which is above and beyond.","There is nothing else I would like to share.","No just please better explanation and more explanation on conceptual questions on the test","He moves fast but provides good material.","Dr. [Removed] is very kind and a good listener. He works hard to make sure his students do not fall behind and are actually understanding the material, rather than just memorizing it.","Dr. [Removed] is always very kind and deeply cares about his students.","The class is challanging but I truely in joy it","This professor has been the most understanding with students, she gives many opportunities to do better in her class and always cares about what people think. She always tries to improve as a professor and acts on it, instead of ignoring students' concerns. Best professor I have had so far in my undergrad years.","I feel like he makes the class welcoming to everyone — although I'm not the type of student to ask questions during lecture in front of the whole class, I'm not scared to go ask him something after class, which is different from a lot of other physics classes that I've taken in the past. He really wants students to learn and it's shown through his teaching and grading style : he encourages discussion a lot, and his homeworks and exams' policy leave room for learning and understanding of the subject.","Dr. [Removed] is very friendly and open to discussion, which is something that I think helps the students feel comfortable in his classroom and have more of an openness to learn.","Dr. [Removed] is a phenomenal instructor and really wants us to understand genetics and why things happen rather than just memorizing definitions and ratios. She loves when students ask questions which is great but I'm just an extremely shy person, so I typically don't.","Dr. [Removed] is a very good professor and really cares about the course and the students. I love how she wants to keep improving the course and give students the best experience possible.","I enjoy Dr. [Removed]! She is very thorough and I like her teaching style, the classes passes by quickly and the resources that she provides allow you to succeed regardless of prior knowledge.","Dr. [Removed] is very caring and understanding when it comes to mishaps with an exam, sickness, technological troubles, and any issues we may face that prevent us from learning. These actions and empathy towards situations helps to create a more fulfilling learning environment that is not constantly pressurized by the need to succeed, but rather by fostering the growth of the individual student.","Love her asking for \" muddiest points. \" Hearing her say \" That doesn't make sense at all \" in response to a student's wrong answer on a lecture recording was a little discouraging.","Dr. [Removed] is very nice and her attitude makes me want to attend her lectures. I was scared about this course but she has made the concepts very simple in how she describes things and I know I have her support if I ever need help with anything.","I really enjoy this course and the experiences I am gaining.","more worksheets and video examples","Sometimes she goes really fast, when teaching the code that when it comes to the try it on your own section, I have no idea how to code. Even the homeworks are hard because I can't remember the the commands or what each one does. I would recommend putting more practices for each command or each section is being taught.","The instructor was very willing to answer questions - even on the smallest parts of lab. She is very helpful and is always walking around the classroom.","very interactive and positive professor, she s very good","I think it would be very helpful and motivating if Dr. [Removed] allowed for students to fix their mistakes to gain points back on exams and demonstrate that we understand the material.","Dr. [Removed] is a very good professor and a sweet person. However, how she explains things sometimes feels chaotic and leaves students more confused than they were beforehand.","No I am grateful for my amazing TA and instructor.","- My professor has made a lot of office hours and community study sessions available which i find extremely helpful \n - she's very sweet and easy to approach and talk to \n - the class can sometimes get boring but I still enjoy the material \n - I find it really helpful that she makes the lectures interactive so that we can learn from and teach our peers.","[Removed] / [Removed]","I love the practice tests and condensed topics list that all [Removed] students have access to. It allows me to study with my roommate who has [Removed] as a TIPS scholar. Although we have different professors, I think its neat that every [Removed] can all study the same content and help each other out. Please more practice problems and test - centered strategy tips! \n\n Dr. [Removed] is inoffensive and she effectively lectures and provides materials for us to be successful.","I would just like to say that I appreciate the way Dr. [Removed] teaches and always does her best to help us all improve and expand our knowledge and passion for science.","The instructor took the time to go to each lab group and learn more about us and our mindsets about the class.","As a member of the dyslexic community vocationally I can not understand a word he is saying","The instructor is fine. I wish she would kick people out of the class that whispered though, cause that's a real problem.","Breaking things down step - by - step helps to better digest the information while also feeling less overwhelmed!","I really enjoy my instructor she is really attentive and is always welcoming to answer any questions or concerns we might have","My instructor doesn't share personal information about herself, or talk overtly about her career, which is a good thing because it keeps the class focused on the course material. It can be easy for instructors to get carried away on side tangents, so I prefer that instructors only talk about the coursework. For this course, there is a lot of information to cover and any time that would be allocated to personal information shared ( either by instructor or by students ) I feel would be better time spent going over coursework.","With how the course is so far, I personally think the encouragement during lecture time to engage in discussion with our peers and the professor himself is a great supplement to our learning experience. I also like how the homeworks provide us an idea of how the exam will be formatted, allowing us students to prepare better and learn effectively.","She is a very sweet professor and will help you out in whatever you need! If you don't understand something, she and the TAs jump to help you out. She teaches with lots of examples, which for me, is the best thing!","No not really I just don't like how we only take like 15 mins to address each topic","I still love her tho, its ok if she doesn't share her personal life.","I think the professor teaches the class well and I have no complaints.","I think Professor [Removed] is an excellent professor. She is very approachable and kind and explains things very well.","She goes through material well and does not rush through anything.","It was sort of jarring to have a professor admit to getting a D in the very class he was teaching to his students. He used that as a way to tell us to just \" do better than him \", which is to say he told us to not be depressed and find better study methods. On one hand, it was sort of encouraging but at the same time it sort of comes off as \" I went through worse so you people better get your stuff together and do better \". It can come off as either encouraging or condescending.","You do a great job of explaining the concepts through the practice problems but we do need to do more of the difficult questions during lecture time as a class, because it is hard to process information and set up a difficult question type for the first time. But once we have the information and see the thought process it gets easier to apply on our own. \n","I asked her a question once at the beginning of class and she answered very passive aggressively. The question was literally about a medical issue I was having and she told me “ You know my ta's are happy to answer any questions. ” I did not think I should have told them and she answered with such rudeness. Also, her slideshows are very messy and she is not a good teacher in general. Everyone I have talked to who has her has a complaint about her.","No - I think the whole teaching team is doing a great job.","She is amazing, love her teaching style","I do not like the way my professor lectures. For an upper division course, I would expect her lecturing skills to be more polished. My [Removed] chem professors lecture at a better pace than her and explain things better","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor!","I think Dr. [Removed] is amazing professor, but I do think he could help in making the material slightly easier to understand. I have talked to my peers and a group of us do think that he does run through the material rather fast, which is understandable, but tends to not elaborate on what he is talking about in words that people without background knowledge would understand. He does go very in depth and it is very evident that he loves what he does which really helps me stay engaged.","I like the instructor's optimistic attitude towards the class while constantly encouraging that we can pass, make mistakes, and learn. It is great to have a vocal support system for students who might not have any or a lot.","I would just like to say that the professor has made my introduction into chemistry, thusfar, a joyful and encouraging experience. I would be very delighted to recommend this professor to any one of my peers.","She is truly the best.","Post the lecture slides before the class on Wednesday so we are able to a study before the quiz.","I like that she lets us do examples ourself before she does it, it helps me realize what I don't understand.","I think professor [Removed] maintains a pretty professional relationship with her students during lecture. I'm unaware of what she is like during smaller settings like office hours because I have yet to attend one. I've attended her TA's office hours and they are competent and know what they're talking about!","I think Dr. [Removed] is very understanding and genuinely wants the best for all her students. She understands that even though grades don't matter, it can have a mental toll on students and make them feel defeated. Therefore, she always encourages us to schedule meetings to discuss ways to succeed, but she also tells us to attend office hours for more support. Hearing Dr. [Removed] say these things makes me feel like I have a better support system within the course and that I could honestly tell her how I feel about [Removed], knowing I would receive proper knowledge and help when I leave.","Kind person, seems very knowledgeable on chemistry topics. However, I sometimes feel it is not explained how to solve certain problems / questions, and content is taught in an out of order scattered way.","She does a lot of good practice examples with us that usually appear in quizzes and examns.","dr [Removed] [Removed] is an amazing professor.   I feel respected, welcomed, and confident in my abilities in his class.","Dr. [Removed] is a very caring professor and genuinely hopes the best for her students. She provides us with a lot of studying material and class content. She provides learning objectives for each chapter of the book we are learning, so we know what to focus on during lecture and for the exams.","Overall Dr. [Removed] is an amazing and kind professor that is invested in the success of her students. I always love when professors are like Dr. [Removed] as it gives me more motivation to work harder in their class and do better.","She's the best!","He always comes to class with a smile and we really appreciate it. Sometimes, life gets hard, and I know he goes home a different person, but when he's in class, he's all smiles.","[Removed] / [Removed] \n","I have definitely found this course to be extremely difficult, especially when it comes to applying what we've learned in class to the homework assignments and the exams. I have found that we barely scratch the surface of a topic in class, but are expected to know way more about it to answer homework questions. I think Professor [Removed] is such a kind person and truly cares about her students, but I am struggling with this aspect of the class.","No, just that sometimes it is hard to follow his though process when he is lecturing and the squarecaps being for accuracy feels unfair because this is our first time seeing the material and we should be having to be able to apply the knowledge already cause we haven't even been given time to absorb the information.","A lot of information is presented quickly, in a small amount of time, and the study resources aren't very helpful for me to perform well in the exams.","Dr. [Removed] is really helpful with office hours and making sure students get the help we may need.","I think first off its difficult to fully answer this survey as I've only been part of the course for around 6 weeks. That being said, while its difficult for Professor [Removed] to really integrate discussions in her lectures, I would appreciate it more if she made class a bit more interactive.","Not really, I like the attitude she brings to class everyday she is always positive.","She is extremely caring and encourages me to learn. I feel she is very approachable, and that makes for a much better learning environment than if she weren't. She clearly explains concepts and checks for understanding. She is patient and kind and fosters a very healthy, inclusive, supportive learning setting.","I really like the class participation that is encouraged and the peer talking. It helps break up the lecture to be more engaging.","I don't have anything specific to say besides how helpful [Removed] is during lab. If you aren't sure about something you can always ask and she will clarify anything for you or give you her input.","Thank you for genuinely caring about your students!","I really like all of the resources the instructor gives us in this class, as it really enriches my understanding of concepts and prepares me for exams well.","Dr. [Removed] is very helpful and willing to work with students, which is something very important. He goes beyond to offer students better opportunities and is willing to help students find what works for them. The course is overall designed for you to apply concepts constantly so you are not forgetting previous concepts which helps students retain information thoroughly. Also the teacher's assistants and Dr. [Removed] are very helpful in class when it comes to answering questions and clearing confusion.","Dr. [Removed] offers a very welcoming classroom environment. Despite the difficulty of this course, he ensures we are all gaining valuable knowledge from our lecture. Throughout lecture he teaches using physical models, student questions, real world examples, and walks us through practice problems.","She's awesome. No complaints and she's very understanding.","I really like Dr. [Removed]. She's by far the most approachable professor I've had. I struggle in coding, but she makes it feel like everyone is capable. She's open to different ideas and problem - solving skills. Dr. [Removed] is truly one of the best professors on campus.","I like that our instructor tries to help us out with certain things that may be on the upcoming test or quiz. However, I do think the class is a little unorganized but overall, I think it a very informative class.","For the last four questions, this is a science class.   Other than talking about who did what, we can not really go into that much detail.   I think he does a really good job teaching us what we need to know for our future classes.","I would love to be able to take actual notes during class because I do not understand anything we are doing or any of the content, and I would like to have actual notes to look at for the class.","[Removed] she lit.","She's a little monotone, but teaches well. I appreciate the resources she gives us to study.","She is a great professor.","So far I really enjoy Dr. [Removed]'s class, the only thing that I would recommend to improve on is the grading, sometimes on an assignment I feel like the TA's take off points for super minimal reasons that aren't even properly explained in the instructions.","I really like the way Dr. [Removed] has structured the course. The worksheets have been great help, as I have always been the type to learn best by example. It really helps to look back on previous work. I like that we use [Removed] [Removed] instead of copying our code on a separate doc like I had to do in other classes, and I like that it is predominantly project based and \" learn as you go \". As someone with test anxiety I feel this is the best way for me to truly show my skills.","Love being able to discuss class content with my peers as this gives me an opportunity to learn from others","The instructor is cool and very down to [Removed].","No she is great and teaches the content well","It is not really a class that deserves feedback. It is set up to set us students up for success and to share resources the university provides.","I really like that you can retest 1 week after exams because it gives you the opportunity to learn more and improve. I went from a 75 to a 90 and I felt I learned the content a lot better because of the retest.","She is a very kind professor who always ensures that her students are doing well not only academically but mentally as well. She thoroughly explains concepts and always patiently answers questions during class.","I think [Removed] is a great instructor and so is the TA. They are helpful and kind. Very encouraging and inspiring","I just really enjoy all the resources that she provides. It makes a scary class feel less scary.","This instructor was great, she'll make sure you pass the class with flying colors as long as you put the work in.","[Removed] always makes sure that we are in a safe environment and that our concerns are valid and she provides a classroom where we can grow personally and professionally.","The instructor is really nice and she is always offering opportunities to help your grade and do well on your assignments.","He gave a very comprehensive review of basic physics principals to start off the first few days of class.","I like the pace that she teaches at and I think the homework / quizzes are representative of what we are learning during class. I also think she gives the right amount of assignments to grasp the material and not any busy work.","I really love how Dr. [Removed] arrange the course material per unit. It is very neat and reachable. So, its easier for us to study.","There is not much student - professor interaction going on in the classroom. Professor does not ask if there are any questions and I can't remember the last time a student talked in class.","She is a great professor! I am so glad I took this course with her. I would 10/10 recommend.","The instructor talked about how he has visited 48 of the 50 states and that he loved traveling, which was nice to know because it allowed us as students to relate to him more and it was a warmer welcome to the course.","I think that is course is pretty nice. It is well organized and students have multiple opportunities to get credit in order for them to get the grade they want. The way this course is structured, I think there is a lot of importance for students to learn from their mistakes which I think is essential for students to succeed.","The instructor is helpful but the course itself is just very difficult. I wish there were more varying office hour times.","I feel like [Removed]. [Removed] has done a great job so far!","There is not much to say other than he is a doing a good job and helping students in the course.","This instructor has not done much besides teach, and that is okay. She has several hundred students in her room and has to teach them chemistry ; there is not much time left for personal stuff.","She is very engaging and approachable.","I appreciate the instructor's ability to balance lectures and student collaboration into class. I also think that the lectures are engaging.","I think the instructor is doing a really good job in creating a comfortable learning environment for the students where people aren't afraid to make mistakes.","She is a great instructor! She is very encouraging, engaging, and supportive.","She is amazing and the TAs are super helpful. The amount of material given outside of lectures helps a lot as well. She focuses on practice problems so make sure you really understand.","I think she is a great teacher and explains her content very well.","Dr. [Removed] made class feel like a very constructive and friendly environment while encouraging participation.","He made sure there were lots of options we could take to study the material.","[Removed] / [Removed] \n\n","He is a great professor that cares about his students and caters to their needs.","Extra help sessions and support for those confused on class","Dr. [Removed], this year, included the 25 question types and review notes which has guided me on my studying and really helped me learn which areas of the material to focus on.","  I am grateful that she gave me a chance to improve on a mistake, however the quizzes seem a bit stressful and unnecessary to the goals of this class.","Overall, while the learning modules are helpful, I do wish most of the material was taught in lectures.","Dr. [Removed] makes it a point to learn our names and she is incredibly kind and caring. She is an amazing professor.","Dr. [Removed] had given insightful comments in class such as : \n “ See me as a coach. Not a football coach, but a [Removed]'s [Removed] coach. ” \n ( When explaining charge density ) “ It's like you're baking a cake with raisins. You wanna calculate the raisin density per unit of volume. ” \n Dr. [Removed] adjusts the closing time of each [Removed] question based on everyone's speed at the time. \n She also gave us choice to opt out from discussion sessions and lectures, which will make the HWs would be worth more.","She always checks in for anyone who has questions which makes me feel very comfortable.","Discussion sections would be better for reviewing the material more.","Professor does a really good job of explaining new and challenging materials to the best of her abilities. Makes sure students are ready to move on and is willing to help one - on - one.","Prof [Removed] has been great so far, and her class is very organized. I love how she explains the concepts we go over in class, making them seem much for simple. She is also very approachable!","The professor has been fair and accommodating.","No information at the moment.","I appreciate that Dr. [Removed] makes sure that all questions are answered and she spends time to make sure her students understand what she is teaching. I also like that her instapolls help quiz us on the content as we learn it. I do feel that her lecture style can be a little slow or inefficient at times, especially when she's picking someone to answer a question.","I greatly appreciate the amount that the professor offers extra credit opportunities to students.","No, that is all.","I find that having to complete learning modules as homework is extremely helpful in the course because it is nice to be introduced to new concepts individually ( at your own pace ) and then get to listen to [Removed]'s lectures about that specific topic the next day and really understand it better than before.","The instructor always has practice questions given to us after discussing a concept. He always encourages us to discuss with our classmates about any questions we may have. He then goes over the questions and gives time for any additional questions we may have.","I think [Removed] is a great professor and is very good at explaining the concepts he teaches.","The instructor is helpful with recommending and supplying resources for students to use. Take initiative over your studies and you'll be fine.","Good energy and she likes the topic.","Dr. [Removed] is an excellent instructor very understanding and workable. He does tend to speed up his content, but if you keep up with the reading, than you should be overall fine.","I feel like Dr. [Removed] is a very understanding teacher and gives all of her students many options to pick from in order to earn credit in her class. She also has a 24 hr grade period for late assignments which is very helpful when most of her students are taking other rigorous courses. I believe that she is a great teacher and cares very much for her students and their time and personal lives.","She is great. Very smart and a great explainer, provides us with the materials we need to do well and is a very kind and genuine lady.","I think the instructor does a good job of staying on track and covering the course material well. I think she can improve on her way of teaching the course. She could add more activities and experiences to demonstrate in class.","I really like Professor [Removed]'s positive attitude. She really seems to connect with us. I also like how much in - class practice she has us do, it's helpful.","She is extremely approachable and I feel comfortable reaching out to her.","I feel like she can't answer questions just because the class is so big.   I don't believe it is negligence to the topic.","Dr [Removed] is super nice and sweet as a professor but his course is super challenging","nothing comes to mind at the moment.","No. I need to study more and go to office hours","I like that Dr. [Removed] starts class by asking how we are or allowing us to spend a couple minutes talking about our peers about our weekend. It lightens the mood and gets us ready to start learning content.","Dr. [Removed] is super awesome.","Not at the moment. \n","My instructor has been great! I think we all feel adequately prepared for our labs, and she's very knowledgeable and willing to help us if we're stuck.","She is very welcoming and makes a notoriously difficult course seem more doable, so I really appreciate the efforts she puts in doing that.","Dr. [Removed] cares a lot about his students and you can tell that he is both passionate about biology and teaching. It makes the class more enjoyable.","I'm not a fan of having to talk to my neighbor every class. It discourages me to go because I have anxiety. I'd rather have them teach and use an interactive discussion board if that's what they want. They want us to teach each other and I believe that's the professors job.","No. Dr. [Removed] is teaching a great physics class.","Dr. [Removed]'s passion for statistics has rubbed off on me. I think her enthusiasm for what she's teaching makes learning the topics easier and relieves my stress. When I go to office hours, she explains my mistakes or questions in a very kind and thoughtful way.","I personally don't like the method of having you talk to and explain your answers to the people around you.   It unfocuses me from the lecture as I'm worried about being social and friendly, and then it just turns into me explaining how I got the answer.   Basically, I never get anything out of it.   I do, however, love silent time to sit and think by myself, and work things out in my head, as well as apply things to the real world in my head in between ideas.","I feel while Dr. [Removed] is a nice person, she also has issues teaching the material. I feel there isn't a point to the classes due to the fact she simply reads off of the slides with no deeper insight. The answers to the slide questions are updated later in class. \n\n During the one exam we had so far, she distracted myself and many others due to constantly calling students to return calculators, which while understandable I feel that if the students in class who didn't bring a calculator should've figured out something prior to the class. She also rushed the test immensely, putting stress on myself because I was still in line to sit down while she already started the test, and when I was seated she was unprepared and did not supply me with my papers immediately, and I had to wait until they printed off more.","She is very set on students understanding the material before we move on, which is helpful.","My professor does not take questions from students.","Dr. [Removed] is amazing. She is one if not the most caring professors I have had at [Removed]","The instructor is very knowledgable on the content, but sometimes explains difficult concepts quickly or in confusing terms. I am not sure if other students feel similarly.","I don't feel like the lectures are very helpful.","There is nothing notable that I can think of at this time.","I really enjoy how the professor will come up to us while we are working on our class activities to ask us how we are doing not only with the material but in life in general.","I think the tests need to be much more lenient- there's only 12 questions and no chance for partial credit","My instructor is very personable and wants us to have fun in lab rather than just be robots that follow instructions and get good grades.","I enjoy how much he cares how the students are actually doing.","I really like her :) I think she's really great and I love having all the study resources","i don't really like the structure of the class. It feels like I should be doing most of the new concept learning during the prelectures but I never feel like I have enough time so I end up just skimming until I come up with a question. Because the lectures are so heavily influenced by the prelectures, I end up being kind of lost and not feeling like I'm learning anything in class. I feel like I'm only learning when I'm doing the homeworks and have to go back through the textbook to figure out what's going on.","I like Dr. [Removed], his lectures are good and I think that he is a very caring professor.","My instructor often speaks on her own experiences and shortcomings which makes her very relatable and more approachable. I really appreciate when she takes time to do this because none of my instructors have been vulnerable enough to share how they felt as students and even young professionals in their field.","Dr. [Removed] is a really kind and good instructor. She does her best to address any questions and is readily available during office hours or after class.","She is a very good professor and very encouraging in the learning environment.","I want this course to have better slides and lecture material as most of the course is self - guided. I would also appreciate it if the textbook was revised as there are so many mistakes in it and for the price that it is sold to students it is horrendous that that quality is what we are receiving. The textbook needs to be better written and have quality content rather than confusing students with the lack of cohesiveness. The most helpful things in this class have been my TA and his notes as they prepare me for the exams as the Professor does not release practice tests or ways to study for the exam.","I think Dr. [Removed] is a really nice professor. he is approachable and I would feel comfortable expressing concerns to him and I feel like he would actually care and try to help the student. he seems to care about the material a lot but breaks it down nicely and doesn't overwhelm us too much.","No other information.","The slideshows she creates are incredibly helpful. The situation is complicated but to be short I came in knowing nothing. I had to learn what a valence electron was, then how the periodic table works, then how to combine and integrate knowledge to create things like [Removed] [Removed]. This class assumes that I already know all these things, but even though I don't I have still been able to catch up pretty successfully. But those weekly 5 question quizzes are the worst little grade [Removed] of all time.","I think that it could help to respond to more questions that students ask online ( such as in [Removed] ) during the lecture period. However, I understand that there is limited time to work with.","He's a great lecturer! Definitely seems to enjoy the job.","The professor is very quick to respond to student concerns and if the issue involves a large portion of the class she will take a few minutes at the beginning of class to mention the issue and resolve it if she has already found the solution. If she does not have an immediate solution, she keeps students updated until she has one.","I have enjoyed this course quite a bit. It is my favorite course this semester due to the professor, his attitude towards teaching, and teaching style. I find it very easy to ask for help or guidance without any judgement. Professor [Removed] is very easy to speak to and I can tell that he genuinely cares about his students.","He is good at breaking down problems and answering questions after class","Love her. Took her for [Removed] for [Removed] and she is the best. [Removed] on my top 5 profs at [Removed].","I really enjoy being in Dr. [Removed]'s class. She is really knowledgeable in the field of genetics, and I enjoy going to her classes every week.","no i really enjoy dr satas class","She is welcoming to us in the sense she encourages us to talk to her about any issues with the class during her office hours and provides coffee and cookies.","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind professor. He provides informative lectures in addition to very helpful office hours. My struggle with the course lies in understanding what the correct formula / approach is for a problem. I feel like the material before the first exam was better explained than the material currently, as I am now starting to have issues with formula identification. I may just require more exposure to the material.","The addition of captions might be helpful in understanding what is being said in class.","She is very friendly, and always smiling which makes you look forward to coming to the next class meeting.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor who I can tell wants nothing but for his students to do well in his class. With that said, I think it is vital for him to see that the topics he covers in class I feel may be vague in terms of what he wants us to know for his exams. I feel as though what we cover in lecture is only the icing on the cake, and we therefore, learn material and equations outside of class that are not spoken about in lecture at all. Especially in a [Removed] I class where much of us have never been exposed to [Removed] before, this can be frustrating and difficult.","Your willingness to improve based off of feedback is amazing!","I wish our instructor would consider giving us weekly quizzes to elevate our knowledge on subjects and ensure we are on track as we are learning, rather than waiting on tests to see if we are full grasping all the concepts correctly. I don't think the DSWs and squarecaps are quite effective enough.","I like to discuss but it can be daunting in such a big class","Dr. [Removed] is very passionate about the course he teaches and very charismatic in teaching that course. I appreciate how he includes examples of the moon landings and astronauts it keeps the class interesting and you can see he really enjoys what he teaches. He is also quite considerate of all his students despite having such a large class so I think having him as a professor will definitely change my perspective on physics for the better!","No there is nothing additional \n","I feel sometimes my instructor takes too long answering people's questions about things that aren't relevant to the course. I think sometimes he should say that their should be no more questions so we can learn relevant material.","The professor feels very distant to students. TA's lead most or all outside of lecture activities. I don't know how to connect to her.","I really liked that at the very beginning of the first couple classes, Dr. [Removed] asked us fun questions as ice breakers to talk about with our neighbor, which made it less awkward to talk to them about the material when prompted later in class.","There is not anything else that I can think of that I'd like to share.","She kind of motivated me to keep going and try to do better in her course. She explained that if you didn't get a score that you liked on an Exam, leave it in the past and don't let it discourage you. She said all it's going to do is create a pessimistic look that potentially makes you feel that way for future tests to come. Ultimately, she said to just use this as a fresh start to try and do better for the next exam to come.","Dr. [Removed] is very sweet and knowledgeable, but I often feel intimidated to ask basic questions about some biology concepts. Even her office hours make me nervous. I think offering a discussion section where students refresh on basic biology would be helpful.","I enjoy Dr. [Removed]'s class. She is very accommodating and helps us understand the material.","I would like to advise any professor, when teaching, to ensure that the material they test students on is appropriately and well taught in class-- enough to where students are confident in themselves when preparing for their exam.","She is just such a friendly and inspiring person and professor, I was scared to take this class but I have been doing amazing in this class and i have been LOVING physics because of her!!! I love the traditional lecture style and passionate teaching with the quiz questions to test our knowledge.","One thing I would like to add is that Dr. [Removed] often times spends awkward amounts of time on different topics of varied difficulty during lecture. For example, she may teach at a much slower pace at the beginning, giving students multiple minutes to discuss very simple topics that had already been clearly answered before. This will leave little time at the end of lecture to adequately explain harder and more detailed topics, so it seems like she rushes at the end at times to make sure she gets through all of her slides for the day. This results in my peers and myself to be overly confident on a topic we already understood but still lost on the important ones that she rushed through during the last 5 minutes of lecture.","She's been a really good listener as we continue to seek help and support from her, she's even helped us by moving her due dates and times for us.","She's amazing in my opinion. I love how calm her voice is and how she will practice problems with us during the lecture.","Yes, having [Removed] Discussion open during lecture in which he often stops to answer questions in the thread from other students has been a game changer when in comes to student - professor interactions.","She's a great instructor and she tries. I think she could do a better job of acknowledging students questions. During an exam I had a technical question and it felt like she was avoiding me and trying to not interact with me. Also I sit in the front row and she sometimes asks students repeatedly to please stop whispering as other students are trying to learn, however I don't hear much if any noise so I just found it strange. Maybe she needs a very quiet environment to be able to peacefully lecture, which is a bit difficult in a class of over 100 students","Dr. [Removed] provides extra credit opportunities, which I appreciate. It is more important for me to achieve excellence rather than perfection. I had a professor in the past implement \" zombie questions \" on exams. This is when they include the most missed problems on the next exam. I think this method ensures that students learn from their mistakes and is more effective than adding a curve or bonus points on an exam.","Sometimes the professor can be a little unclear on expectations when asking us to do questions on our own. I think it would be helpful for her to sometimes nudge us in the right direction before giving us time to work on it. Overall though, professor [Removed] is very approachable and kind.","There is not anything else I would like to share.","[Removed] / [Removed] The instructor has been great so far.","She is a great teacher.","You are an amazing professor and I appreciate all your efforts!!!","Giving us a wealth of resources to study and review with has been really helpful in coping with the workload of a college course","I appreciate that she was very understanding in the first few weeks when struggling to submit assingments.","There is way too much unnecessary work. This lab takes up more time than some of my engineering courses just because of the random assignments that I don't believe have even impacted me or taught me anything.","The way he carries the class being able to joke with us but also keep it serious when needed. I also really like the ice breakers and activities we do to get the students active and get to know one another.","I would like to say that Dr. [Removed] is a great professor. She makes sure her students are engaged in class and does her best to make her students have the opportunities to be successful.","Assignments were posted inconsistently, with many longer modules being posted the day before they were supposed to be due relatively late in the day. This put me and many other students in a bind before lectures.","She doesn't let people talk about what is happening in the class even if they are whispering. She derails the class to talk about how my class is the worst whispering class.","The chosen questions for our quiz were very difficult compared to the other lab sections. I think that there should be a fair set of questions for each lab with equal difficulty for each.","The instructor consistently offers advice on class topics and provides many examples. Additionally, the instructor does not leave the students to fend for themselves over questions, instead they lead us through them and toward the correct answer without explicitly saying the answer.","I like that [Removed] was able to introduce himself which allowed us to be more comfortable asking question and so that we are not hesitant to do so. I appreciate how both instructors set this course up as it is very engaging to me.","Dr. [Removed] takes a personal interest in each and every one of her students. She is very good about ensuring that no one is left behind and that everyone has equal opportunity to benefit from her class.","That one time Dr. [Removed] passed out cough drops to students who were coughing made me feel like he genuinely cares about his students' well being","She is doing very well and provides a lot of resources for us","He makes me smile every day. :-)","During lab, it can be hard to hear the instructor and oftentimes she doesn't speak up. Due to not being able to hear her, I don't have a very clear understanding of the things she is discussing and sometimes get confused. She also moves quickly through the material and everything feels rushed. This makes me anxious and I tend to rush through important steps ( especially when learning new techniques ) instead of focusing on proper technique.","I really like how many resources are available to her students and how she always makes sure there is a way students can personalize their studying based on what is most challenging to them. The question types, review and lecture slides, and practice problems / exam are very helpful.","Barely any professors do this, but Dr. [Removed] talking about her life experiences and struggles really makes her approachable and relatable. I believe many teaching individuals underestimate this skill. Dr. [Removed] does bring random life events. The life events she talks about is to either reassure or motivate us. This has made it less stressful to learn physics. Also she is incredibly positive and optimistic. This aspect of her is very contagious and that is a good thing.","I like how our professor solves some example problems during the lecture. It helps me understand the material more.","I like the instructors teaching method, I don't think there is anything different he should do.","I love how Dr. [Removed] focuses on our growth mindset and makes sure we are focused on the learning aspect of the course rather than just grades.","The instructor can move a bit fast at times but overall good professor.","Nothing in mind.","Nothing I can think of at the moment","Dr. [Removed] is a wonderful instructor and she has made the [Removed] Science class really fun and engaging!!","I'd say he a great instructor overall. Very laid back and capable at creating students capable of passing this course.","The pre lessons that she posts make it way easier to understand the in class lectures.","[Removed] [Removed], he loves physics!","She s very efficient with how she teaches and encourages students to talk to others during sharing time.","Dr. [Removed] is awesome and, by far, one of my favorite Professors on the 40 acres. TA [Removed] is also super helpful. He often explains things to me a second or third time to reinforce it.","I enjoy learning the biological processes on a macro level, and enjoy the videos that we watch to help.","I really like that the instructor is extremely clear when clarifying any misunderstandings about a question or concept that I do not understand.","nope! But the class is mentally challenging","Not at the moment!","I feel like Dr. [Removed]'s lectures are helpful most times, but they are a hit or miss. There is a part of it where his lectures do not relate to the topic, and the rest you have to prepare prior to class because he moves on from each topic way too quickly.","The instructor is very accommodating to students and allows an opt - out option for lectures and discussions, offering a redistribution of grading percentages to not include attendance. Even though I prefer to attend in - person lectures, this practice made an impression on me because it showed that the professor was understanding of students' needs and understood that people learn differently.","Professor [Removed] took some time at the end of a class to talk about how some of us may feel that we don't belong at [Removed], but that nobody is perfect at everything the first time they try it, and that we are all at [Removed] for a reason. I thought that was very kind and helpful.","I have overall enjoyed the structure of this class","She's good, just very monotone.","Dr. [Removed] is a funny and engaging lecturer, but the material we cover and quest practice is not sufficient to succeed at the level I am used to, even though I prepared thoroughly with the lecture notes and homework problems.","Very accommodating and understanding that not everything will click the first go around so she takes time to review every class.","Very well organized and awesome proffessor","Overall she has a very nice layout and structure to her course and it is easy to feel valued and encouraged always. She is very motivating and provides clear expectations of what is expected of us on any assignment or assesment.","I think the instructor is fair and cares about students' understanding of the material. I would recommend this course to others.","I've enjoyed this course so far, because prof. [Removed] makes the lectures interesting. I especially like that the lectures and instapolls really emphasize core concepts.","The instructor really minds when there is whispering in the lecture hall. And while this is nice and she promotes a quiet environment, I find there to be many times where I don't notice any whispering and we stop class to address the small amount of whispering there is. This halt leads us to getting less information than other sections.","she is great and i love her class","I would really like more short &amp; lt;5min breaks that offer icebreakers for us to talk to each other more, more specifically without any chemistry content involved.","I like the way that my instructor has the class set up. I think that the learning modules that are required before class that cover what will be in the lecture help me learn a lot better. She also explains everything in common language and thoroughly enough so that it is easier to understand. She also provides many resources for studying when exams come up, and makes sure to prepare us for what is going to be on the exam and the question types.","I would ask that the professor allow for make - up exams for a better grade because grasping physics is different for everyone and the learning code is slow.","No, I have no other info to provide","the professor also offers one on ones after midterms which is very helpful.","Professor is a great chemistry professor for dealing with a very large class","The instructor is wonderful at explaining the course material and how to apply them to real life problems.","No, I really like her though. She is very welcoming and very fair. I like her method of [Removed].","The instructor isn't great at explaining all concepts and having to do majority independent work to get the material.","I feel like the instructor answers the questions in class as if we already have previous ecology knowledge and sometimes seems irritated when a student is still confused after she's answered the questions.","Sometimes my instructors make us feel like they're one of us. The are very welcoming and approachable and any question is a good question to them. I don't feel afraid to talk to them or ask them for anything.","huge class so I don't blame Dr. [Removed] for not being able to check in with every student","i do not like how we do not get to choose our own lab groups for lab. i am working with someone who does not do anything and talks too much, so lab is very unenjoyable for me.","She is a great professor!","I like this class.","This is a [Removed] course ; I see no issue with this. We're here to learn [Removed] and that's what our Professor teaches us","I wish that she would give go more into detail on the newer information to college freshman and not spend so much time on the already known things, such as electronic configurations and such. Also feel like the class could be much shorter if she got through content faster and didn't let distractions slow her down.","I really enjoyed the positive energy and support the instructor brought to class.","He reached out to me individually to ask about how I was doing and my performance in the class. Him doing that really means a lot to me, and it reassured me that I have support in this class.","This instructor has been amazing with answering to our curiosity on the things that we observe in lab. She is always prepared to push our thinking and help us along the way. She is also very understanding of our personal lives and provides support to us in any way needed. She is able to adapt to any situations occurring.","Sometimes Dr. [Removed] goes really fast during lectures so sometimes it would be nice if he paused so we could have a second to write everything down.","I love how caring Dr. [Removed] is about her students and prioritizes our wellbeing. She often sends out messages reminding us to take a breath and get enough sleep and make sure that we are taking care of ourselves.","This js a very textbook heavy class and you definitely have to study and put in the work and if you do you should be good","I like how many resources she provides us with to practice course concepts.","There was one time when I was particularly late to class ( which is still something I am working to ameliorate ), and so I had missed the [Removed] question for the day. Dr. [Removed] was very understanding and reopened the [Removed] so I could receive credit for that day. It really hit home that she is an understanding and supportive person, not that it wasn't already pretty clear by then. She always takes the time to answer student's questions and really makes an effort to interact with the students whenever possible, as well.","The change in lab style which includes quizzes that are graded in a tough manner all just for 3 points has caused so much stress. It feels very unfair because last semester students didn't have to do this. The weekly assignments, the [Removed] assignments to be exact, take up way too much time and are also unfair because to receive full credit we have to be reading and writing for about 35 minutes, take part in discussion ( which is fair ), and also give and receive upvotes. There are so many students in one assignments so there are chances our comments aren't seen by everyone because of the amount of comments and we might end up not receiving upvotes. If that happens, that is points off. The TA is also pretty strict it doesn't feel like a learning experience at all it feels as if we're being monitored and a single mistake will cause her to get mad at us and treat us like little kids who aren't doing things correctly. I came into this lab with a positive attitude and with the idea that I will get to earn my bio lab credit in a fun way while learning new things. Instead, I am left with so much unnecessary stress. Overall, I'm having a pretty stressful experience.","I have come back to Professor [Removed] to take [Removed] [Removed] after taking [Removed] [Removed] I really like her teaching style and easy communication, and I was so happy that I'd be able to take another class with her.","This instructor is great! There are some cases where she wouldn't mention certain parts that I said \" No \" to but that's because it wasn't necessarily relevant. I also think that TAs are sometimes previous students who can provide recommendations about curriculum and coursework.","Not really, but he's good!","1 believe the instructor should open the prelabs 96 hours before the first lab of the week. Additionally, 1 do not believe we should do quizzes but rather more practical examinations as those will curry on for future lab courses.","Dr [Removed] provides us with many resources to allow us to succeed. This includes review notes, practice exams, active discussion with peers, [Removed] Discussion access, weekly quizzes, and more.","There should be more background before jumping straight into college chemistry. Maybe the first week can serve as a review of the chemistry readiness modules.","He gives good examples that directly correlate with the homework on [Removed]. This makes the homeworks so much more manageable.","I liked how much he stressed the important concepts.","The lectures are very fast - paced and it is hard to understand and digest the materials.","She is very open and approachable.","My instructor is very kind, understanding, and super helpful. I really enjoy being in her section.","I think the instructor could do a better job explaining the topic a little bit more. I feel like sometimes, she gives us the answer but doesn't explain how she got there. Other than that, she is a great professor and all the extra resources are very helpful.","Dr. [Removed] is a genuine and kind professor who wants to see his students succeed. He is helpful and actively gets students to participate in class, which is important in cultivating growth.","I really enjoy the motivation that the instructors provide.","I love her formatting style of teaching as it really lets me grasp my understanding of the material!","dr [Removed] hasn't done much","She had fun experiments during class that made the class more enjoyable.","Its a very interactive class and much more manageable than [Removed] chem lab. Working with groups helps force you into working and getting to know other people.","I think he's a great professor. He enjoys the content.","Sawyer is just a really great personality and brings a sort of comfort to the lab setting, doesn't feel like she is talking down to us or is better than us in any way, and this makes for a more inclusive learning environment.","Very supportive made me feel good about this class","Dr. [Removed] does an excellent job at explaining difficult statistics concepts, especially since there are many students who are seeing this content for the first time. She provides many opportunities for practice and assistance through office hours which makes me feel supported as I learn this topic.","She is very interested in the study of genetics and genuinely wants to create connections with each student, especially through memorizing names.","I enjoy the instructor for ecology. I think she does a fine job at teaching a topic she is very involved in.","The professor redirected us to the [Removed] health center and advised therapy. The professor did not appear to be able to help students individually outside of academics.","Dr. [Removed] is very supportive and offers many benefits throughout the course to ensure that students do well in her class.","I do not feel that this is necessary for a chemistry course, there is not a lot of other historical context that is delved into due to most important chemistry discoveries being held by white men.","Dr. [Removed] is a very sweet and helpful professor and cares about her students deeply. I have only heard good things about her from other students on campus and I only have good opinions about her myself. I would definitely recommend taking [Removed] 301 with Dr. [Removed] if you have to option to.","Dr. [Removed] is very much invested in the success of her students, which transfers directly to the motivation of her students and them understanding the material.","I think [Removed] makes the class very welcoming for everyone and I feel safe being able to share my thoughts and opinions.","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind man who is visibly passionate about biology. Unfortunately, his lectures are confusing, and the resources given to learn are limited and unhelpful. Most students rely on the textbook and outside resources - such as [Removed] videos - to stay caught up with the material.","I would like more practice problems that are similar difficulty to the exam so it gives us better practice for the exam.","He's good at answering questions. If he doesn't know the answer of the top of his head, he'll research it and answer it in another class.","I really like this class. I think the professor is great. I do know that sometimes the energy in the class is low because the class is at 9:30 am and a lot of kids are tired. I do like how the professor still tires to interact with the class and keep the energy levels up despite the circumstances.","I strongly dislike how homework modules which take multiple hours to complete if you want to actually grasp the topic come out only 1 day prior to the due date. Also, I do not like that some notes that came out did not match other material provided from the course. Example/ different [Removed] values for differentiation between [Removed] and [Removed] bonds. Also, a few notes that came out had wrong information on them and had to be fixed later in the course. Obviously nothing is perfect, but I guess I just expected more from a university that costs 40,000 + a year. That being said though, the program tries very hard to make many resources and opportunities for students' success","I think she's great","Professor [Removed] is extremely supportive and encouraging towards students regarding exams and quizzes. She constantly reassures us of our abilities and understanding which leads towards less stress and more confidence when taking these assessments.","I really appreciate how encouraging and nonjudgmental she is when helping us with the content.","There was a specific moment when I expressed to Dr. [Removed] that my friend dropped the course because he did not feel like he had a physics brain. This genuinely made Dr. [Removed] sad and he gave a quick lecture to the class about coming to him before dropping because he wants the best for us. That shows me that Dr. [Removed] actually cares about his students and he wants the best for each and every one of us.","I love professor [Removed], she is so lively and personable. Even though the concepts we cover in class are relatively simple she makes it fun and keeps us involved and entertained, which I love about the class and this instructor.","I don't really like chemistry, but I am not doing as bad in this class as I thought I would. I feel like chem courses are usually really hard to pass, but I've understood about 75 % of the material without crazy studying.","Professor [Removed] is extremely kind, caring, and truly wants the best for her students!","I love how accessible all the materials are, because I'm definitely someone who likes to go in and flesh out my notes after lectures, and Dr. [Removed] is really great about updating material according to what we've done in class. I also appreciate that the Learning Modules don't lock until the day of the test because I like being able to go back and read over the information there.","She is great! \n","No, thank you for teaching us!","Not at this moment","I appreciate how Professor [Removed] [Removed] tries to run physical demonstrations of the concepts we're talking about during lectures. It helps me better understand the material.","She is a very sweet person and you can tell she loves her job and cares for her students","I wish we used the lecture times more productively, I feel like I am forced to learn all the content outside of class instead of actually during the lecture. Also, it's hard to understand units because we always mix content from later units and overcomplicate details that aren't necessary and it becomes confusing.","He's just a very cool and nice person and I appreciate how generous he is with what can be graded and allowing corrections on exams which is an encouragement of possible failure and an allowing of failure to be ok at the same time.","I wished there was like a concept check that we could do on our own outside of class after the lectures.","She is super knowledgable and allows us to ask her questions about lab procedures.","I like that my instructor uses relevant examples to our fields of study and interests.","He always has a positive attitude which makes going to class enjoyable.","This instructor wants to see her students succeed, and makes sure they have every resource necessary, from question types and study materials to complete reviews and prerequisite information. Anything that a student needs is accessible to them, and there are several TAs ready to answer questions. The overall environment to this course, even with over 1300 people enrolled, is comfortable and success oriented.","I think Dr. [Removed] gives us so many resources to study which is the key to success in this class.","This course is really fun and you get to develop laboratory skills, which are beneficial in the future for those interested in the medical industry.","It is my opinion that Dr. [Removed] has spent too much time trying to shush students in class when they are speaking while they are not supposed to be. I agree with her in that their whispering and sometimes complete just talking is distracting, but I also think that as a professor she should of all people be able to tune it out to focus on the lesson. She has said that my class ( 11 - 12:15 ) has missed out on multiple insights for the tests that the other 2 classes have recieved because she spends so much time having to stop and ask people to quiet down. I can appreciate the first couple of times, but she has easily made the comment 10 + times a lecture and I find myself frustrated not only with the people talking, but her for bringing it up so often instead of going through the lecture. I am fully aware that talking is incredibly disrespectful to her and the rest of the students, but I'd like to say again that in my opinion she needs to spend less time focusing so much on it to just continue teaching so that the rest of us can learn as best as possible.","The instructor's approach was practical and supportive, providing clear guidelines on how to collaborate with classmates and access resources for foundational knowledge. While it didn't stand out as anything extraordinary, the consistency in their communication made it easier to understand expectations and navigate the course. This helped reduce uncertainty and made the course manageable, though it didn't significantly change my overall experience.","He's actually a good professor my only complaint would be how fast he goes on the lectures and how soon he starts the next unit after just finishing the last. I am studying a new unit while trying to understand the next one and it is pretty hard.","I think this professor is very understanding of students work load and personal matters and does the best for us to understand the topic at hand.","My instructor has offered a lot of materials for preparing for exams which is very helpful.","I think the instapoll questions he gives in class are very helpful in improving our learning experience. It makes the stuff he covers in class “ stick ” and keeps us engaged ( which is very important for a 1.5 hr lecture ).","I really appreciate this teaching team and all their support!","The instructor's response to one of my friends' answer to her question was at one point quite rude. Despite that, I wouldn't say there was anything else.","I like my instructor and I like the structure of the course so far, so I'm interested in seeing what comes next","Dr. [Removed] seems to genuinely enjoy lecturing and helping students understand the material.   He's a very engaging lecturer and super helpful during office hours.   I actually enjoy going to lecture and learning the material, which is saying a lot because I used to hate physics.   I'm hoping he teaches the next series of physics classes so I can sign up for another one of his courses.","Honestly, I really like Dr. [Removed] and I would recommend anyone to take him. I came into his class with absolutely no prior knowledge and this class has so far still set me up for success. He is also extremely understanding which is so nice to have in a professor.","Dr. [Removed] is a very funny man and I enjoy learning from him.","Dr. [Removed]'s positivity and openness makes her class very interesting and exciting, despite the difficulty of the material.","Professor [Removed] is a great lecturer, plus his labs are well - organized. The lab classes would be better if he is able to make time to help students in the lab sections ( whether it's in - person or virtually ).","He is very nice and obviously cares for students. I think the HWs are really hard [Removed].","Overall, the course has been challenging and engaging.","Not so much about the instructor, because it has been a good experience so far, but one thing I'd keep in mind is about how much space each student has on the desk during quizzes / exams. There isn't much space to work with so sometimes that's an issue. Another thing I would recommend is if a student misses out on a lecture due to a legitimate reason there should be a way he / she can make it up.","Overall, great guy, knowledgable professor, simple class, a lot of material to cover.","He is a good professor, very thorough in lecture.","I think she should ignore student distractions and continue to give the lecture instead of pointing it out ( or threatening us that she will not provide the same information to us as she did in her other classes )   because it takes away from time that could be spent giving the lecture.","Dr. [Removed] is one of the most encouraging professors I've had at [Removed]. [Removed] is a challenging subject ( and one I've personally never learned before ), but she aims to make it simple and accessible to everyone in her class. She encourages making mistakes and emphasizes their importance in the learning process. Finally, she talks about her own challenges and failures in her career. As someone who has struggled academically but still wants to be successful in my field, her dedication to sharing her story has made an incredible difference in my life. I truly believe her attitude and approach to teaching is one of, if not the most, encouraging I've come across at [Removed]. Science can feel inaccessible at times and Dr. [Removed] is moving mountains in her mission to create an environment where students feel comfortable and confident in their ability to learn.","He is very kind and approachable","I really like that there is an option to not have to ask questions out loud but rather through ed discussion, which makes it easier for me","The grading policy is not clear. You may lose points for some unexpected things.","Dr. [Removed] is a fantastic professor. She is one of, if not the best professor when it comes to answering and explaining questions, no matter how stupid it may be. She is very patient, thoughtful, and her organization skills do not go unnoticed as it helps me manage and understand the class very well.","I appreciate the professor being understanding of possible situations students are going through as well as offering numerous ways to study so that there is almost every type of option out there, ensuring everyone can study the best of their ability.","Sawyer is a great person who is very relatable and easy to talk to. She really cares about us and our projects, and she is willing to help no matter how long it takes. She is very knowledgeable in the course and has no issue helping us out at any point.","Well, it's a class of nearly 100 + people from the looks of it in a lecture hall, with only an hour and a half of class time, with only 2 days of actually visiting. It should not be the fault of the instructor who has done their job well of educating who they need to, but if the university is looking for a more \" inclusive and positive \" experience, it requires actually giving physical closeness and opportunities where learning one another's names at all is a possibility. I'm sure it's not convenient, but as the greatest university in the country, if you * want * to make the experience to fit that criteria, you either commit, or work to improve the system we currently have.","She's very personable and shares times from moments that she also made mistakes and it creates a comfortable atmosphere.","My professor has made learning physics an enjoyable experience. The environment in the classroom is very welcoming and encourages participation.","My instructor and the assistant are the best instructors I have ever met. They both truly help us learn and care about our genuine well - being.","She did experiments for the class and explained why they did and didn't work. She also explained things through imagry which makes it much easier to visualize problems, especially in a class like this","The professor overall encourages a welcoming and positive learning environment.","I think the amount of work in this course is unnecessary. It could be reduced without changing the overall learning experience. It is a 2 hour course with 4 hours of lab a week and at least 2 hours worth of additional assignments per week.","I think Dr. [Removed] really cares about her students and their success in her class, and I think that I would love an opportunity to take her class again.","she is a really good in teaching and provide us with insides on how to do well on the test. i am really happy to be her student","She is always positive during class and you are able to tell she enjoys what she does which gives a positive learning environment.","This instructor takes a lot of time and care to thoroughly answer students' questions. On multiple occasions, he has looked into things between lectures in order to elaborate and better answer a question from the previous lecture. I think this is very helpful and makes the instructor very approachable.","Slides and class in general feel very disorganized, it feels like we are bouncing around a lot and she also says \" we will practice this later \" like 5 times a lecture and i usually don't feel like we end up practicing said thing","She spent a lot of time in the last class ( September 30 ) waiting on students to stop whispering during class, but I felt that created a stressful environment that was frustrating and made me feel like the class was getting behind even though it is difficult to control an entire class of hundreds of students to ensure that there is complete silence","I don't like that in the first unit, we fell behind a lot because it seemed as though Dr. [Removed] wouldn't get straight to the point in the lecture. She uploads videos of Dr. [Removed] as assistance through our learning modules homework, and I feel like I learn more with his videos than I ever do with her. I passed the first unit exam with a 92, but I thank myself and my further studying and research about the unit, not exactly Dr. [Removed].","Dr. [Removed] is really nice and you can tell she cares about us! She provides us with many resources to help our studies and is always willing to help.","No, she is great instructor and I enjoy going to her discussions.","I think by allowing us to share about our week ( through [Removed] / crappies ) and then rewarding us for sharing, the professors have encouraged honesty and transparency amongst students. This is really important and I encourage that other professors use a similar approach to work around students being nervous or anxious to share about themselves.","Dr. [Removed] clearly cares about his students and is passionate in our learning. You can tell that he will do anything and provide whatever resources necessary if he believes they will help us learn and succeed in his class. I do wish that lectures were a little more clear in explaining the content, and that we were given a little more time to answer the sqarecap polls so we could more deeply understand the questions. The TAs in this class are very attentive and want to help us understand concepts. Overall a good learning environment but a little fast paced.","There is nothing else.","A lot of in class demonstrations made learning the current material much easier for myself.","I only have positive things to say. He seems to really care about us learning and is very understanding towards students. He also does a good job explaining material.","I like how the professor and TA's are constantly walking around the lab and are available for asking questions throughout the whole lab period.","I find Dr. [Removed] personable and encouraging. I leave the class with a better understanding of the material thanks to her clarity and the class structure. I benefit from the flow of learning modules, in - class lectures, and instapolls / quizzes.","I think the instructors should offer points back on the quizzes, or cut down the amount of questions. There are many questions, a large portion of which are memorization based. For the first quiz, we were asked about the number of related deaths / illnesses in 2019. I do not understand the point of asking such a question. 2019 is not the most recent year, so why 2019 specfiically? Additionally, what is the point of memorizing such a fact? will this be usable in our future career knowledge? How often do adults discuss this on a daily basis? I feel that memorization questions are unfair. Asking more practical questions makes sense, such as [Removed] procedures, or the proper methods in subculturing plates, etc. These are questions that we will apply in the lab. The quizzes are very frustrating, and add a stress factor from the extremely large bank. Additionally, last year's class did not have to take quizzes. There is also no opportunity to earn points back. To improve, I think you should eliminate the quizzes like last year, reduce the number of questions, give the chance to earn points back, or allow the option of collaborating such as group quizzes. In other labs, you work with peers and fellow researchers to accomplish a goal, this should not be too different. The quiz aspect of this class should have improvement","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor who wants all of her students to succeed.","The professor cares about the students feelings not just teaching. I like the professor.","I like how she encourages us to talk to our peers and tries to make the test as fair as possible.","I would like the lecture slides to include more notes on them. However, that is just preference as I'm not a good note taker.","I feel as though the lectures are a bit loosely structured, and in order to truly learn in the class you must take some time to digest the information outside of class hours. I'm not opposed to this and I think this should be the norm for classes, but it is sometimes hard to learn when irrelevant discussions occur throughout the lecture.","Dr. [Removed] tries his best to explain a complicated concept to students","Overall, I think the way my instructor teaches is good. He explains the material fairly well. He seems like a professor that wants to help you, you just need to reach out.","I like that he gives us an opportunity to ask questions on [Removed] throughout the lecture and will answer them once he is done.","The course lectures are very fast and much of the class is left confused or unclear because the rate is faster than people can formulate questions or understand what they don't understand to the degree of being able to articulate a question. This leaves many people needing outside help and committing additional time and energy to learn from things that were not clear in lecture and there was no time to ask about because the professor moves too quickly usually from material subjects. Not everytime but certainly often enough to leave many confused.","He is truly incredible and structures the course incredibly well!","During the first two weeks she asked us to talk to the people sitting next to us about something, I am not too sure what it was, but I remember it actually being a very awkward conversation with the people around me and I would have liked a more like lighthearted or fun discussion question.","Dr. [Removed] is a very caring person that genuinely hopes to see you succeed. I also believe the smaller class size lends to a greater sense of community in the class, letting me feel like I truly fit in.","I really enjoy how engaging my professor makes the lectures. Most other classes are not hands - on, but this one allows me to learn by doing, which is how I have always learned best. I appreciate her commitment to making sure everyone understands what is going on.","Overall, Dr. [Removed] provides many useful resources from undergrad research opportunities, practice problems, office hours, online unit reviews from TAs, and even external resources beyond class material for more curious students.","She is a very genuine, understanding, and approachable professor. Extremely nice!","I really like the unit review structure and the very clear expectations of what will be on the exam. In previous STEM courses, the review guides were overwhelming and vague, often not knowing what material I should prepare. In this course, the question types allow me to organize my studying and feel confident before exams.","Dr. [Removed] and her teaching assistants created a very welcoming and supportive classroom environment, which significantly enhanced my learning experience. Their approachability and constant readiness to help with any difficulties made it easier to engage with the course content and reach out for assistance without hesitation. They frequently checked in on students' understanding during and after lectures and were always available for extra help during office hours.","Professor [Removed] sometimes asks us how our weekends were, how our week is going, and likes to make some conversation with outside of the content we are focusing on in class.","Dr. [Removed] is a great instructor and pushes us to be the best we can be. I appreciate her teaching style and I am excited for the rest of the course. \n","Free snacks during student hours!!! Both [Removed] and Dr. [Removed] are very helpful and eager to answer any questions if you go to them after or outside of class, which makes the learning experience much more enjoyable.","In my opinion, the quizzes with the [Removed] bank of questions are unnecessarily stressful... but that's my only concern!","Dr. [Removed] is just a very caring person in general. I have had professors that don't even pretend to care, professors that say they care but don't actually care, and professors who I genuinely believe had a sadistic personality disorder. Dr. [Removed]'s class is the first time I truly felt welcome and cared about. This is a really hard balance to strike because your professor is ultimately the one responsible for your grades and, by extension, your future, so there is naturally a lot of room for conflict. Maybe it's just that Dr. [Removed]'s personality is uniquely caring, but even when I don't do as well as I wish I had in the course, I still feel like I can speak to her or the TAs and get help, and that they will go out of their way to help me because they really want to see me learn. Overall a very good experience, I don't even like genetics but I really enjoyed this course!","I'd like to be clear that the instructor I m reffering to was my lead instructor [Removed] [Removed], he has been great, passionate and straightforward. The learning assistants have also been wonderful. The name I put down for instructor who most impacted this course was the TA [Removed] because he negatively impacted my course greatly because of his attitude with students.","It's not exactly an issue because we don't have exams in the course.","I would like to say that sometimes Dr. [Removed] has a judgemental tone when students answer a question wrong. I don't think she means to do this, but it is sometimes discouraging.","Very good instructor especially considering I am going from high school physics to college level physics.","Sometimes I feel unprepared to complete the assignments. I attend [Removed] and every class period where I take thorough notes and ask questions but I felt unprepared to do the third homework. I enjoy how class consists of a lot of examples but I felt unprepared for the kind of questions being asked which made me question if I'm missing something. I have a learning disability so sometimes it can be challenging for me to connect dots that are very subtlety placed and I usually need things to be laid out for me to understand them. Especially in a class like physics where I have no experience whatsoever. Overall, I would like to see questions similar to what we are going to be tested on during lecture so I feel more prepared to properly demonstrate what I am learning in class.","I feel as though the study guides provided for tests do not provide a clear outline of what the test will fully be over.","My professor was great. There is nothing in specific","I think the instructor's positive attitude and just overall joy for what they do makes you want to show up to class everyday.","I really like [Removed]'s method of teaching. The asynchronous modules plus the review of it in class is one of my favorite methods professors teach.","Dr. [Removed]'s compassion is truly what makes her class amazing! She cares about her students, both in their learning and their overall mental health, and I think out of all my professors', she's been the best at creating a positive learning environment. I also think her dividing the class into \" teams \" is pretty innovative and it's helped me get to know more of my classmates, and hear diverse perspectives and explanations!","He goes through information quickly which makes it hard to keep up, but he is approachable to ask questions.","This class I have felt successful in because Dr. [Removed] presents students with many opportunities to succeed. She posts detailed learning modules for knowledge prior to the lectures and posts several resources for studying for exams.","She has made it very easy for me to focus and learn.","I really like Dr. [Removed]. She honestly makes learning chemistry enjoyable for me, she goes fast but not to the point where you get lost if you looked through the material before class. She is patient and kind, and I'm thinking of becoming a [Removed] because of her class.","I like Dr. [Removed], but it is hard to connect with her one on one due to the size of the class. That is out of her control, though, so it is not a big complaint.","No, the instructor has been great in helping us succeed so far.","Nothing else, she has done a great job and I'm happy with her class.","She makes me feel hopeless. Genuinely like I have no chance in the class no matter how much I study or try.","Dr. [Removed] is a very laid back professor in a way where he provides a calm learning environment during class. That allows to not feel stressed out during class and comfortable when I do not understand something the first time it is taught to me. His TAs are always engaged during class and he always encourages group collaboration and full class participation when learning new topics.","I would like [Removed] to utilize lecture time as learning time, not review time over content in homework.","Dr. [Removed] is a great teacher. I wished she talked faster.","She is an awesome professor and very vulnerable which is so important to see as a college student","I dislike how she uploads different slides from the ones in the actual in - person lecture. In the modules on canvas, there are slides missing or that she does not show to us so it's hard for me to know how she got to a conclusion.","Just that she is very strict and detail oriented with grading and although I see her reasoning, the amount of coursework for a lab and my other 4 classes is a lot and the smallest of mistakes does not seem fair to take off such large sums off of the grades","Dr. [Removed] also consistently uses physical models to demonstrate the concepts we are about to learn in class, or the concept we just learned depending on if the model comes before or after learning the concepts.","I like Dr. [Removed] but I feel like sometimes his lectures don't really prepare us well for the questions he asks at the end of class. Even after doing the reading I have difficulty answering all the questions within the 10 or so minutes provided, especially since many of the questions involve interpreting graphs / reading paragraphs.","Dr. [Removed] is a wonderful professor, and I really feel supported in the course.","N / [Removed], [Removed] she's doing a great job.","I like her positive disposition and how enthusiastic she is about the subjects we discuss.","I think she is a great professor! She tries really hard to make sure everyone is comfortable with the material and tries to make the content fun and engaging. I never really thought I could understand physics, but she has given me the courage to try my best, and that caused me to get my first 100 on a physics exam. :)","I think opening assignments for completion sooner would make this course better. I wish that I would be able to begin my [Removed] earlier than Sunday, and my perusall assignment before Thursday. The course feels “ heavy ” by the end of the week because we have our lab photos due Friday, our research report due Friday, our perusall due Sunday, and then we must begin the [Removed] on Sunday ( or else we must do it on Monday ). It just feels like a lot in a couple of days for the course, and I would prefer to spread out the assignments by getting some done earlier in the week. Even getting the perusall out of the way earlier would be nice!","I enjoy the use of squarecap as a way to practice the content after we learn it during the lecture.","Dr. [Removed] seems to genuinely care about students.   It does become slightly frustrating that it feels like the end of our class time is rushed because of time / classroom management.","I think my instructor is doing her best to make sure there is a direct and clear path to success within her class. While it does require extra work, she provides us with the resources for success. The only thing I dislike is that certain class materials, like the learning modules, are not always provided with enough advance but are necessary for an understanding of the material within in - class learning. I also believe that the communication on when it is most useful to complete these by should be more clear. Sometimes it states they should be done by a certain time on the assignment but the due date is set to a later time and I believe this makes some confusion.","I feel that Dr. [Removed] is very concerned with student needs and attempts to provide all students the chance to reach mastery. However, in a 300 person lecture class, it can be difficult to meet students at a diverse set of backgrounds and hear all their difficulties. While I do feel that the teaching assistants alleviate this burden, I still feel that, for those struggling, the overall size and organization of the class can make the experience frustrating.","I do not like the assigned groups in labs. I feel as if I do significantly more work in the lab than my group partners, and it stresses me out because of how little time we have to complete labs. I believe that working in groups or collaborating should be optional, and if you do choose to collaborate, you still have to submit your own work.","She is very kind and approachable in class","He is very good at elaborating and going in depth into topics. He also explains many of the real life applications of what we learn and I think that is important.","I didn't always understand the basic processes. Often he uses examples to help us see, but often it is a little too specific and confusing because he skipped over a more in - depth process description. I also have a difficult time knowing when something is important. I understand that we should learn all we can, but when it comes to studying there is a limited amount of time and brain space. I do appreciate his square caps and discusion sections because they provide additional questions to review before the test so we can become more aquatinted with his style. Overall, he is a very kind and understanding prof, but I don't think his style works for me.","There is far too much content covered in such a short period, and lectures are sometimes rushed since they are only an hour long each. There are also things stated in the syllabus that are not provided for students to prepare for exams, such as practice exams ( besides the last - minute one from a TA ).   [Removed], the professor is incredible, but he could do more to help his students learn better and succeed in the class.","I would rather figure out the results of my exam scores on my own rather than being called out for having a low score on an inbox message. I understand that the instructor was probably doing this out of consideration to better improve myself, but I did not take it light heartedly. Nevertheless, I do appreciate the reminder of going to office hours.","It was such a hard course to study because the lecture did not explain the basics at all ( basic concepts, terminology, etc. ) and had all of them for the students to study by themselves through learning modules. The modules were hard to read, text - heavy were always uploaded late and required much more time commitment than the lecture. \n Also the professor didn't cover the whole materials before the exam in the lecture","She is great and teaches very well!","During the in class activities Dr. [Removed] would go into the rows and assist students that need help, which is nice.","Dr. [Removed] is an amazing instructor because you can tell that she cares a lot about her students. She always encourage students to talk to each others and help each other out. The collaborative environment really made me enjoy genetic more than I had expected because I find genetic a really hard subject to learn ; therefore, I am really glad that I am able to collaborate on things such as homework and quizzes. I also thought that it was really comforting that Dr. [Removed] said something about how hard genetic is to learn because there was time I felt like I didn't have the capability to learn genetic. However, knowing that genetic is a relatively hard class, it further encouraged me to try even harder to do well in the class knowing that it is normal to think that genetic is hard.","No. [Removed] [Removed] is a fine teacher who uses Dr. [Removed]'s lectures and notes to format her lectures. It's really just that simple.","She's very uplifting and asks students to talk to her if there are any issues and how she's willing to do what she can to help and support us. It honestly was refreshing to hear that since there are a lot of professors that don't particularly care about most situations, so it was a welcoming difference.","Dr. [Removed] is a very solid professor and she makes a really good effort that proves well","They don't immediately test after they finish a unit's material ; they wait about a week, making it much easier to study and score well on the next test.","She is encouraging and ensures that we know she truly cares for our success.","I enjoy this course, but it is a hard course.","Not that I can think of","Dr. [Removed] is great!","I think she has done very well with trying to understand where the students are. She has also done well with explaining everything when someone is confused.","I think the amount of resources and help available is very useful as if you don't pick up on how something works in a lecture, it can be easy reviewed using the resources.","She is a great teacher and very supportive and taught me about growth mindsets.","No my instructor is quite adequate and does a good job of passing out material to study","Dr. [Removed] is a very sweet instructor, and she teaches her class the best way possible. She always makes sure that everyone gets all of their questions answered during student hours, and she tries to make the environment more fun and social as well as opposed to being another quiet lecture.","I feel like we don't get through the slides enough. Class will be half way over and were not even half way through the slides. And then she has to rush through the rest. Also I don't like how we have quizzes on material we just learned that day. I understand that may be personal issue.","They gave us lots of practice that was similar to the test and that helped me prepare.","She is a great teacher.","I really like how our professor teaches, it is very clear and I learn a lot from her. I also really appreciate the study guides she has available for us.","Sometimes the professor doesn't time the lectures appropriately, so we end up behind. This means we have to speed through some of the lecture slides faster than I would like. While the content isn't difficult to review on my own, it can be frustrating when we fall behind.","Lectures are structured pretty well.","She is very kind and calming, and I can tell she truly cares about her students.","Dr. [Removed] has made me love chemistry. I always had a hard time with anything science related, but the way she teaches makes me understand the material.","She is very good at answering any inquiries and she is very good at explaining the topic in advanced but easy - to - understand terminology ( since she explains it ).","she's a great teacher","I did everything in this class that I was supposed to do before the exam. I had done all the textbook readings, re - did the homework problems three times, redid the practice exam twice, went to multiple office hours sessions, and reached out to other friends in the class. I had fully felt as though I understood the class content. However, after the exam I was disappointed with my grade despite the fact that I tried my best and the questions of the exam were significantly difficult, which we had not encountered in class or in the practice before.","This professor will talk about the importance of mental and emotional wellness and how it ties into academic success, and ties in her own experiences with it. I think this has been very beneficial and is very relevant and relatable to alot of students, and personally I have found that it makes me feel more understood, motivated, and relaxed when learning. I greatly appreciate this and think it's great!","He goes pretty fast in class so it really helps to pre read using the textbook.","I wish that my instructor would slow down on the more complicated topics, because often times the people around me are just as confused as I am so the small group discussions are not effective and we need further instruction.","actually break down the math problems and explain step by step where each thing is coming from because this'll help students who do not have prior experience","The class is sufficient, more collaboration and more examples during class would help with understanding the topics.","I think the instructor goes a little too fast, but I understand that this is supposed to be a fast - paced course.","Dr. [Removed] is extremely caring, empathetic, and I have no doubt that she genuinely cares about the lives and learning of her students. In our discussion section, she gets us snacks in the morning, easily making our days.","I HATE 30 [Removed]. [Removed] [Removed], at least give us the whole lab time to do them, so i don't have to stress about running out of time, and actually focus on the concepts rather than the time.","I liked how she gives examples on each thing as we are going through lecture.","I think that this professor is great. I wish the class was 2 sets of 1.5 hour lectures rather than 3 sets of 50 min [Removed] lectures each week but that is only because I think the class goes by too fast.","Just always making me and other students feel like they are on the right track complimenting our achievements and reassuring us from our failures","This is not feedback for [Removed], who I have only nice things to say about, but rather for the course at large. \n\n Please be more respectful of our time. There are elements of this course that are by nature time consuming ( like lab work! ), and that is perfectly fine. However, the way in which lab photos are processed ( free form on a document ), all of [Removed] ( which you should know, totally incentives gaming the system rather than criticall thinking ), and the way that labs must stop and go together makes most students spend a lot of \" rote \" time in what is billed as a two hour course. Nobody likes to do that, and that constant disregard for brevity makes what should be an interesting course feel not enjoyable.","He had a very uplifting positive attitude","Gets distracted fast by students “ talking ”. I never hear anyone speaking but if that s a problem maybe asking students to not talk at the beginning of class.","Dr. [Removed] is a great instructor! Her lectures are easy to follow as she offers countless resources. She is also very forgiving with grace periods and dropping our lowest grades. It makes me feel like she understands we have lives outside of class and that things can happen. \n","I enjoy that Dr. [Removed] cares about the people we are outside of the physics classroom. I've heard from other students how even though they don't particularly enjoy physics, they enjoy having Dr. [Removed] as a professor. I enjoy physics as a course and also enjoy Dr. [Removed] as a professor because of his focus on who we are, what goals we have, and what we value in our personal lives. He understands that physics is not exactly what gets us all out of bed in the morning and can connect with us on other levels.","Dr. [Removed] spends a lot of time allowing students to work on practice problems and then goes over them, which is very helpful to me.","He is a very good lecturer and explains topics very well.","He's great, just wish the homework's and test were more in line with the questions he asks in class","Dr. [Removed] is amazing and definitely one of my favorite if not my favorite professors. She is so kind and truly cares about her students. I feel that the material can be challenging and fast - paced at times, but I really benefit from her office hours and discussion sections. She makes class so fun and interesting, and she is an amazing professor to have especially as a freshman.","Dr. [Removed] has had us work together on a few worksheets during class, which I have found helpful. I like also having activities in class that help me actually use / answer questions with the material that I've learned -- I find that it really helps my learning.","Overall, Dr. [Removed]'s class is challenging, however I am appreciative of the resources she provides on her canvas page.","The instructor has many good components of the course, however more practice problems or homework may help students be better prepared for the exams.","I think if the instructor was a little more clear about what we are going to be learning for the week before just diving straight into the content, less students would be confused when we are bombarded with information.","I like how she shares small hobbies and things she's passionate about outside of work. It makes me feel special as a student.","It would be difficult for the professor to make sure all students understood the material before moving on as this class is very large, but it does help that there are TAs ready to help you when needed.","Professor [Removed] really makes the class feel like safe space and it is so calming and helpful.","He is a good professor","I really like Dr. [Removed], he's very nice.","The test was very challenging overall. Many student failed","Dr. [Removed] does a good job at encouraging students to ask questions and to visit office hours so he can clear up any confusion in this very challenging course.","I would like a bit more review material. I asked some upperclassmen about additional review material,   and they told me that they had access to an \" orange textbook \" which had additional practice questions.","I like the vibes of this class and encourage y' all to keep it up. It certainly creates a positive experience -- especially since this is my first lab. Thank y' all :)","The professor did some experiments in the first week of class that were really interesting. I think they should be a constant part in most lectures.","I think sometimes she's just reading off of the slides and marking things that aren't necessary. Before our test, she had two lectures where she mainly went over electron configuration, which I personally do not find to be that difficult of a topic, and felt as though the time could be allotted to things much more difficult.","I wish we would get more organized and less broad review content so that I could prepare deeper for relevant topics and not spend as much time on things that are going to be more surface level so I could be more productive.   I like how for chemistry we are provided specific question types and practice problems so we know what specific topics are relevant for each issue.","The atmosphere is really nice and quite enjoyable to participate in. The only thing I would rather not is have attendance mandatory.","Nothing at all so far, liking the class!","My instructor has been doing a great job teaching interactively.","He is very understanding and smart.","No, she skips over some material and doesn't time manage lecture well sometimes and focuses on easier concepts then leaves us to figure out the harder concepts on our own.","Prof. [Removed] is very nice and actually cares about students","He's overall energy and mood during class is positive. He's very passionate about physics and he's actions shows that.","The instructor is a great speaker with incredible charm.","I like that our professor wants us to strive in her class and if you need help she is more than happy to help.","She always asks us how she can do better or if we need help","Maybe focusing only on the material that'll be on the next exam rather than going more in depth on details that won't be asked.","I like Dr. [Removed] as a professor and think he genuinly tries to make the class interesting and relatable.","Professor [Removed] genuinely cares about her students and this is very evident in class every day","I really enjoy this class and would recommend this teacher.","I like her grading policy and the way she reviews previous topics at the start of class as a refresher.","The instructors are very thoughtful and obviously care a lot about the students and make sure that everyone feels heard and understood. This has made the classroom a very inclusive and supportive environment where the students are able to fully express their opinions and feel comfortable enough to share their own thoughts and experiences with the whole class.","I really appreciate the structure of the course and how it is centered around practicing during class and the support we get outside of class. I like to learn by doing and I feel like this class allows me to do so.","Dr. [Removed] often gets frustrated in class when TA's answer student questions. However, the questions students ask are very important and most people rely on TA's to answer these questions because Dr. [Removed] won't. She also stops class often and gets distracted by students whispering. The constant stopping in class usually leads to us not having enough time to finish quizzes or slide presentations.","I like the assignments Dr. [Removed] gives us in class. I find them very helpful to make sure that I understand the material and see what I have to study later.","No, honestly our TA is very kind and wants us all to succeed. She is very approachable and extremely thorough with her instructions / expectations.","She alwasy seems to say for everyone to stop the whispering and how its a distraction however I never hear any whispering and her repeating for it to stop is more of a distraction and we tend to move slower. It seems like she is more bothered by it than anyone else in the class.","I feel comfortable going to this professor if I am struggling and need help.","I really really wish we would spend more time in class actually solving practice problems that are exactly like the homework so that when I open the homework I'm not completely lost. I wish the lecture time was used more efficiently. He's doesn't go very in - depth in the problem solving sometimes and brushes over it. I wish he would give us a practice exam before we taken the exams to more prepare us or give us similar questions to the exam. Last time I remember a lot of the questions had topics we never discussed or barely discussed in class. I know e are supposed to be able to figure it out with our knowledge but I still would rather it be mentioned in class.","No, Dr. [Removed] is just all around great!","I like Professor [Removed] a lot.","I think Professor [Removed] does an excellent job with [Removed] [Removed] His lectures are generally interesting and are well connected to previous content covered. He seems to understand that not everyone will immediately grasp a concept ; during in class [Removed] quizzes, he drops hints to guide our thinking. With the example of [Removed] quizzes, my previous physics instructor ( [Removed] 303 [Removed] ) did not provide any guidance, and the quizzes were more heavily weighted on being correct, which ultimately led to confusion, the feeling that I wasn't learning, and even resenting some of the course content. \n\n Otherwise, Professor [Removed] is very approachable. I've asked a few questions myself and have been satisfied with his responses, and I've not seen him answer a question in a way that belittles or embarrasses a student. I feel that Professor [Removed] and the students both understand that [Removed] [Removed] can be rather difficult.","Professor [Removed] is very encouraging and always reminds us that it's okay if we don't pass or do well on a test.   She says it's one grade and it doesn't define us.   For me, that's very comforting, and it makes mistakes more acceptable.","Dr. [Removed] is a phenomenal professor and he is the standard I hope to see in future classes. He is genuinely invested in teaching and understanding these concepts out of [Removed] it's clear he doesn't view it a boring responsibility. His lectures are easy to follow and concise. I don't feel shy about asking for clarifications when I need it and I do feel like I learn [Removed] [Removed] at a fundamental level. His grading is completely fair and the workload is pretty good. I believe he doesn't feel the need to drown us in work to prove that we are learning, the [Removed] are enough. Simply amazing professor.","He is very good at keeping the class engaged and he plays videos from space and does example problems like what we saw in the videos ( he did his PhD on physics of the moon )","She is a very helpful professor who is always willing to help her students learn the material.","Dr. [Removed] is very thoughtful and truly wants us to do well in her class. She's a great professor.","No he is great! \n","Dr. [Removed] is a very well rounded professor.","He is a very good professor, but I feel like sometimes he goes a little to fast. I know there is a lot of concepts to cover, but sometimes he goes through the topics too quick and doesn't give time to process what he has written.","He is genuinely very nice and funny. His lectures are kept short and packed with information. His exams so far have been pretty fair and the grading scheme is very good.","I really like the way the course is currently designed with the [Removed] Types for each unit, it helps me prioritize what I need to understand and the topics I need to study further.","On the very first class day, he shared that he went through some tough times during his freshmen year of college, which affected his GPA ( can't really specify [Removed] of [Removed], and idk who's all going to read this survey ). He went on to add additional encouraging words about how we can overcome challenges. I, too, had tanked my GPA my freshman year because of some mental health challenges. Although I have been showing upper trends as far as grades go since then, I have always been disappointed in myself because I thought I was making \" excuses \" for my bad grades, although I did go through some of the most challenging times. Listening to Dr. [Removed] being vulnerable has helped me to feel better about myself when trying to study. I need to go talk to him and share my story!","I'd like to be more aware of what specifically students make mistakes with and how I can improve not making them.","She is very nice and approachable, but the lectures are sometimes rushed and vague.","I liked how engaging the professor tries to make her class!","In - class quiz questions should come from the things we learn from the lecture, not from the modules or readiness assignments.","The instructor is extremely passionate about physics and has truly inspired me to be interested in the subject as well! The class is challenging, but professor [Removed] outlines the course in such a way where if you \" fail \", you have the opportunities to grow and learn from your mistakes. This has helped with reducing stress but also gives us a second chance to better understand the material! She is really an amazing compassionate professor!","no she's a good professor and she's always positive that the class will do well.","  I think Professor [Removed] is one of the best mentors I have been taught by so far. She understands that us students are humans and extends an amount of grace that most professors do not. She allows for us to make up assignments and truly gives each student an equal opportunity to excel in her class.","Dr. [Removed] is very understanding and willing to help students who are struggling in class. Although the class can be difficult, he does not make it unnecessarily difficult on purpose and only wants to see his students learn and succeed.","I think that it is a great resource that he uses prelectures and reviews them, but with the time they take up I think it can lead certain conversations to get brought up too much or become too surface level.","The instructor enjoys a fast - moving lecture, but also slows down to help the students engage in the material. I enjoy participating in the instapolls and the handouts, as they do help me deepen my understanding by engaging.","The entire layout of the course is incredibly helpful for someone who is barely transitioning into the rigor of college courses. The [Removed], availability of [Removed] / office hours, quizzes, review notes, etc. is a perfect way to set students up for success. Having such a thought - out and established course has definitely helped me.","Nothing else really, great lectures and clear about what she is asking on assignments.","I enjoy the active learnings and the practice problems in the lectures.","I really like this course and it makes me feel like I'm contributing to something big","No, Professor [Removed] is doing a good job in helping understanding through class activities   and collaboration outside of the class.","This is a science course, and a very big class, so most of these things I'm ok with and it does not effect my performance in the course.","She's always been very supportive throughout the course and has provided even some practice from another professor who has also taught this course Mrs. [Removed], overall she's been great support and provided me with a push to continue working hard on all of my classes.","nope, he's a good professor","Yes. In the exam review on the exam day for midterm 1, a student asked a question about trophic efficiencies and rather than explain that huge point of confusion she laughed it off and said its rather simple. This had a strong negative feeling for me because not everyone is on her level of knowledge(obviously ) so if someone has a question she should approach it as if they know nothing rather than shrugging it off as simple.","I appreciate that instructor's office hours are frequent, convenient, and laid back. The atmosphere is light hearted and not intimidating, facilitating an environment in which I feel comfortable asking questions.","She is a very humble and kind person.","Dr. [Removed] is very kind and welcoming which I appreciate because college can sometimes be stressful and having a kind and understanding professor can make or break your experience. He makes learning engaging and fun. I really enjoy having him as my teacher this semester.","i love learning from [Removed] [Removed]. She is so friendly and so very easy to understand. She is also very encouraging."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>instructor_id<\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.course_additional<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"instructor_id","targets":1},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":2},{"name":"or.course_additional","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

I also talk about my own personal experience working.    I do this when there is a time in class, but we did have a class all about career pathways.","Ha, I plan to use the survey - explaining that its use us to help evaluate the practices in this course.","I always emphasize that making mistakes with the R code is actually a better way to learn the syntax and how specific we need to be. I regularly use common mistakes with the R code to also emphasize concepts ( for example, how we need to choose how to represent data depending on its type ).","Show how detecting and analyzing mutations are crucial for research and health \n Upcoming week ( learning about mutations ) \n By the end of class, I hope you recognize how detecting mutations is crucial to identifying potential carcinogens.","I did an in class discussion about purpose where students discussed different kinds of purpose and tried to decide which ones applied to their work in this class. I very regularly give real - life or career related examples.","This is a good idea I need to think about how to do in basic physics but I will try","Students generally didn't do very well on Midterm 2, so I had students do a shorter ( new ) Midterm 2 a few days later for the opportunity to earn back half the points that they missed. I mentioned to students that we will do a retake instead of just curving the scores because what is important is the learning of the material, which they can demonstrate by doing another exam.","For example, today we were discussing specific forces like tension and the normal force, so to set up the discussion I showed students a video of the current record for skydiving as a way to get them to visualize forces that not only a skydiver experiences, but the forces that we experience in everyday life. During the lecture, I mentioned during two worked - out problems how doing the problem will help them figure out a real - world application in that they can calculate the forces involved when they may need to hang an object from their ceiling.","Its important to draw a connection between topics and real world examples or applications. This is one of the criteria we are assessed on in yearly observations, but more so it helps students frame understanding and sort information.","We continue to emphasize access to office hours and similar resources with considerable effort from the LAs to provide both office hours and study review sessions. Course extra credit is offered to encourage attendance and we will continue to emphasize these opportunities through the remainder of the course","I do this every day","In my large lectures we discuss the value of mistakes in helping to understand the decision process that goes into problem - solving. For my pedagogy courses we touch on specific mistakes and brainstorm changes to behaviors that would mitigate these.","We have instapoll queries in most class sessions and will continue to do so. We use this as an opportunity for students to discuss amongst themselves as well as with the LAs and myself.","I am writing an email if I see that students are not participating in the in - class quizzes. \n And I encourage the students who have   a lower grade to reach out to me.","For each lecture I make sure to break the lecture up into segments so that students can talk to their neighbors about the material. This can be for more formal situations like doing an [Removed] question, but I also have students talk to their neighbors as I lecture through the material particularly when I know the concept in question can be confusing. I have students talk to their neighbors to check to see if they are both clear on the topic.","I emphasize the course structure that includes Replacement Exams, vs. a cumulative final exam. Students can learn from their first time taking an exam on Unit 1 material, for example, and then replace that exam grade at the end of the semester. Students can learn from past mistakes and misconceptions, and conquer the Unit 1 material the second time around.","Policy : contact me directly for additional acommodations","We shared the opportunity to talk bout things that they didn't understand during office hours and class. Always ensuring students that the goal of learning topics was to relate it to their life, not to become experts.","Using office hours to encourage them","I use examples provided in the book. My goal is to incorporate current examples I see in social media but it has been difficult to do so this semester to have time to do so.","In my courses there is a major collaborative project that is pursued through scaffolding assignments. I mention in each assignment what learning outcome the assignment will help them tackle.","We talk about learning strategies.    TA reach out to students who have missed the class to help them make up the attendance.","Between the two [Removed] surveys, I told students I first thought how it would replace my mid semester survey, but that it did not quite meet those expectations, e.g. I did not have feedback on my start - stop - continue questions. \n\n Therefore I launched my usual mid - semester feedback survey. \n I analyzed the resulsts and shared those with them. \n I specifically looked at the start - stop - continue answer, listed them, tallied them and responded in groups of suggestions : \n - policies / practices that are already in place, but students might have missed ( e.g. leniency in [Removed] grade ) \n - policies / practices that I immediately implemented ( e.g. practice exams without the key visible ) \n - policies / practices that seem good, but can not be implemented due to too many demands on our class time ( e.g. practice exams explained in class ) \n - policies   / practices that I can not implement in the same semester due to syllabus statements or pedagogical reasons. ( e.g. different exam policies ) \n\n I shared the survey results and analysis with students in an announcement and pointed out some changes at the beginning of class.","Students work in small groups ( 3 - 4 students ) to design and conduct experiments.   They work together to collect a soil sample, conduct experiments, and then present their results together at the end of the semester.   Students also use [Removed] to discuss ( on an app ) ethical issues.","Everyday in class I have students work with their neighbors on a handful of formative assessments that I pose to them. I specifically mention to students that they should talk to their neighbors to help each other learn the material better.","An ice breaker on a fun activity or event that happened over the weekend \n Upcoming week \n I'll give you a couple of minutes to share with your team something fun you did or an interesting event you found over the weekend.","In [Removed] [Removed], students interpret data when I present certain concepts using graphs. They also interpret mathematical models when we talk about [Removed] [Removed] equilibrium equation, logistic and exponential population growth. \n I usually start the lecture mentioning that we will cover the mathematical component of the course. In addition, I try to convey to students that mathematical models are working hypothesis that use numbers instead of words to convey ideas.","The course is framed as a class that is designed for them to succeed in their transition to college. They are told that when assignments and readings are assigned, they are designed with the goal of helping their personal growth, not for the sake of a grade. If they try their best, they will receive a full grade.","This is what we do everyday in class and for every assignment!","Values writing activity before we discussed career exploration.","[Removed] [Removed] carries an Ethics Flag, so I give students many opportunities over the course of the semester to discuss controversial issues.   Many times, that leads to students sharing their personal values.   Students have these discussions using [Removed], an social learning app.   Using this app, they read assigned articles, watch videos, and then answer prompts ( which I've written ) as well as comment on the issue.","I have polling questions in every class. \n I provide the correct answer and address misconceptions as they arise ( from poll histograms )","Using instapolls during the class, pausing before and after solving an example in the class, constantly encouraging them to share their questions","I am doing value based activities last week and then later in the semester.    We also have a whole class on mental health.","We have let students know to reach out for late assignments or missed assignments. When this happen, students are not penalized for submitting assignments late if they reach out. Words that I have told students are : \" We are not here to penalize you and your grade. We know things happen. Please reach out if you have to submit an assignment late and we can figure out what can be done in reopening assignments \".","Most of my classes do not have any individual timed assignments and my materials are accessible so the only way students usually use their accommodations is with flexible deadlines. I will make sure that they know they can submit their assignments a little later if that would improve the quality of the work they turn in.","We provided resources to help students be successful beyond the classroom as this course is designed to help with the transition into higher education. Students were shared these messages on an almost weekly basis.","I am doing three hings : \n 1. reading quizzes on [Removed] ( ungraded ) \n 2. polling questions in class \n 3. at the start of every week, I aks them what was the muddiest point from the previous week. I summarize theses ( with help of AI ) and provide a handout to students.","They are offered a second try at each midterm exam.   The second try occurs 2 days after the first so it is fresh in their minds. I always tell them between tries that fixing mistakes is a great way to learn.   Also, the two tries reduces test anxiety.   Everyone has bad days... Personal stories.","At the end of each week of lab, students are asked to interpret results from experiments and provide an explanation for the results they recorded during the week.   Here is an example question on their 11 - 8 Research Report Assignment on [Removed] : \n\n Where your results expected or unexpected?   Why?   What do these results tell you about the bacteria in your soil sample?","Students explored databases to analyze a gene and protein of their choice in their second project. Also, many topics covered in the third unit had real - world examples and applications for both courses I teach. \n October and November \n For this project, you'll choose a genetic condition of your interest and identify a protein - coding gene associated with the condition to do some research using the 3 websites provided in the project.","We asked students to share their personal stories and interest to explore their success after taking this course, specifically their educational trajectories and career experiences. We did this throughout the semester at different points.","About once a week, I remind students to come to office hours and try to convey what they can expect when they come.","I will briefly share my interests in music in the well - being message sent on [Removed]. \n The week of Oct. 13th \n Our interests and hobbies can help us endure challenging times and value our uniqueness. \n","Continue to tell stories about failure and improvement. \n [Removed] student's video how they mastered the physics course. \n LAs in class providing feedback. \n With email after the exam motivating students to make use of the re - take exam","By using instapoll during lectures students are able to practice the newly learned materials","When students are asked to complete the Course [Removed] [Removed], I send out an email encouraging them to fill out the survey.   I explain that I use this feedback to improve the student learning experience.","always make sure to encourage them to work on the instapolls and examples together before I myself discuss","Since students are developing new skills, possibly in a topic where they are not interested in, they were told that the skillsets they were learning in class was to improve their overall experience at [Removed]. It was always presented as a benefiting of skills as the goal of the class.","I do this in class when I am encouraging reticent students to participate in answering and asking questions","I had my students do the second writing activity on Personal Values. \n Nov 1 \n We all have important values and goals in life. I want to learn about your non - academic values - what you enjoy and care about. By recognizing your values and gifts, I hope you view your current challenges in the broader context of your life.","After a new concept I pause to get questions from students. I discuss with them the answers of the In - class quiz questions. I have students providing me their answers.","We will do this today as feedback from their first exam.","There is language in the syllabus and in my welcome announcements stating that I believe this. There are statements in the syllabus, and discussion in the class, about how in previous semesters essentially all students who have made use of the provided opportunities in the class / engage fully with the class have gotten the grades they hoped for regardless of starting points or setbacks to emphasize this point. There are many opportunities in the class for students to earn missed points back by doing additional / replacement assignments.","For this course students have been given tokens to request a 24 hour extension, also two lowest homework assignments will be dropped","That's what my whole course is about. They will create their own analysis and also review some analyses as case studies.","Some of our ice breakers talk about professionals in STEM.    Then give the students a chance to talk with each other about their STEM identity.","I do think / pair / share activities for prelecture comments / questions and for squarecap questions and I allow essentially endless questions about them, I keep answering until there are none left ( almost always ).","This semester I will be showing a few videos of people talking about how they learned from their mistakes. I also state this during class from time to time. When discussing a problem solving strategy I talk to students about how they may make mistakes when approaching a certain problem, but that is a valuable learning experience that will help them later in solving future problems.","Show a graph of the number of mutations plotted against the parent's age \n Upcoming week \n I want you to look at this graph and think silently about the prompts shown before answering. \n","Students work together in class and with assignments. They share ideas in discussion posts, have a team facilitation assignment, and connect with their peers as they instruct them once a semester.","We shared with students that they need to apply situations to things and topics that they may not have covered, especially at students studying different areas. We let them know this often in class through their introduction to educational topics.","We encouraged students to share their ideas and experiences as it related to their backgrounds and identities. This happened on a weekly basis, with words and messaging consisting during class, before class, and through canvas messaging.","I give ample wait time in class. I specifically ask students to think to themselves sometimes before asking for a volunteer to answer","Share the results of students' prosocial purpose writing activity \n In the upcoming week \n Thank you for writing about your prosocial purpose and helping me learn about you. I enjoyed reading your reflections and want to share some insights.","Since last survey, there have been two new assignments where students have to chose their own topic aligned with their interest areas. \n\n They have been introduced to the two new assignments in week 9 of the semester. \n Because these are both group assignments, students were asked to brainstorm about both assignments in week 9 and record on paper their own interests, and then decide as a group, within the realm of possibilities for their assignment. \n\n The tricky part is that the assignments are aligned with learning outcomes as well, and therefore they can not just pick anything that they're interested in. \n\n [Removed] Note 2 is aligned with [Removed] related to biodiversity, so students are asked to compare biodiversity in e.g. space ( e.g. their hometowns, major cities,... ) or ime,   or within taxa that they're interested in. E.g. many biology students have an interest in pollinators or birds or reptiles etc. \n I did have to give some feedback to students hat their chosen topic did not address biodiversity. E.g. you can study biodiversity of birds, but not biodiversity of only grackles. That might have been perceived as a negative by some student groups. \n\n [Removed] Note 3 is aligned with the LOs of the course that relate to landscape ecology and conservation biology. Students were asked to pick a topic within this realm, but many suggestions were not at all within this realm. I also gave some advice and suggestions on this. Again, this might have been perceived as a negative by some student groups. \n\n","I provided a introduction how important the survey to my teaching strategy is \n to foster belonging and growth mindset. \n I will have a second survey \n I have at each day of class a check - in question to get students feedback","The students did a values based activity last week in class.    I am planning to do another values based activity later in the semester.","I will run a midsemester survey and I also occasionally do squarecap questions about aspects of the course.","After exams, and this time in class after the second exam, gave directions to students on how to evaluate if their learning methods were effective.","All assignments were based on identities of culture and race. This was done during all classes in a way that was broadcasted as positive and asset based.","Students just finished midterm 1. I will return [Removed] paortion of the exam today. \n  I will make an announcement in class about grades and also about the effect of significant life challenges on grades.   However, I do not wish for students to come forward at that time to ask for re - dos because of significant challenges. I already did provide multiple opportunities to take the exam early / late \n\n\n\n \" I know Exam 1 might have been challenging for some of you, or you may not have performed as well as you'd hoped. That's completely okay ; the first test is often a learning experience. \n Remember, this exam is just one step in the learning process. It's not about where you are right now but how you can grow from here. \n Also, I understand that life can sometimes throw challenges our way — whether it's personal, family, or other commitments. These struggles can certainly impact how we perform academically, and it's important to recognize that. \n If you're unsure where things went wrong, I'd be happy to go over your exam with you. We can pinpoint areas to focus on for next time. \"","Retest for Exam 2 ( since fits survey ). \n Did it on October 21. \n \" Exam 2 score will be replaced by Exam [Removed] score if it is better. \"","Ask [Removed] questions about the content \n In each class \n Say the question on the slide as is or rephrase the question","some of our ice breakers talk about current professionals in STEM","I am using zombie problems, that way students will know what are the lowest performing questions and how the concept is helpful in being able to solve a similar question","While ensuring I cover all the appropriate course material, I want to include real - world examples during class. For example, in Gas Laws coming up, there are a lot of applications, such as [Removed] diving and hot air balloons. I see this tactic as one where I can tie in student interests ( like pre - health majors ), as well. I will think on how the upcoming topics can tie to medicine.","One of the examples that I showed students more recently during our discussion of moments of inertia is that how a single number can tell us some very important details about a planet. This was an attempt to bring in a real - world example of how we determine interior structures of planets by calculating their moments of inertia.","I have students turn and talk to their neighbors regularly throughout class to discuss narrow specific questions. They also engage in active learning around primarily conceptual problems 1 - 3 times per 50 minute lecture.","Students where asked to apply their lived experiences to all of the topics that we cover in class as well as assignments. We asked them to reflect, share, and explore their experiences as it relates to conversations in class.","I use [Removed] to gauge students' understanding of the material. I typically give students one or two questions per class and I show students the results ( in terms of a poll that shows the distribution of student responses ).","I will use the essay from the first day to discuss how they feel about their progress after the first test.","I am using reflections on my content assessments to learn whether the resources available in the course are helpful for student learning and what else we can do to help their learning.","I do this every class, as I ask them to guide me through solving problems.","I usually give students a few minutes to write down their thoughts or derivations before demonstrating it myself.

Then we'll solve it together.","Assigning a group project to collaborate with their peers to learn about a career they are interested in and talk to someone about the same to submit a report.","By using the reasults from the first [Removed] survey","I sometimes asked students to discuss a question or problem in pairs and other times to discuss as a team ( 5 - 7 students ). \n October and November \n Please discuss this question in pairs with your teammates. Please discuss this problem with your team before we go over it together.","Will discuss my sports and my [Removed] favorites. \n\n\n If there were 3 items, I'd fill in when, words, but for 14, c'm on!","I have made examples in lecture more explicit and centered around answering a research question using real data.","After each exam, I try to share a personal story, using the belonging stories structure, with the students. So there will be at least 3 of these. I am not sure what story I will tell since I decide based on the feel of the class at the time. I will use language motivated by the belonging stories.","Students were given a lot of feedback in their assignments in a way that wasn't punitive. Always in a way were they could share their ideas and feel like they can authentically share without feeling like it might impact their grade.","Students work together the entire semester to design experiments and then analyze the data together.   They work together to create a Research Poster to present their findings to the class.","I have consistently shared applications to my research or other research I am aware of. The first survey indicated that some students found this to be engaging and effective so I made a point of including several specific examples over the last few weeks, specifically a superconducting bearing and [Removed] circuits used as detectors. I typically walked through the application of the class amterial to the research along with visual aids.","Almost in every topic I find it extremely helpful to use a real life example","I use a getting to know you activity at the beginning of the course that allows students to express their interests. They present this activity to their peers in discussion and I also get to read their responses and try to provide comments in their assignment. This semester, I have not been able to provide comments yet.","I have an entire class devoted to exploring career pathways in [Removed] and beyond and will do a mindset matters values activity that week.","I told students to think silently about the question / problem before I prompt them to talk. \n October \n First, think silently about the question / prompt and then I'll cue you to discuss with your team.","I've talked about inequities in high school background and I will do so in future","Check - in question about students music interests. \n Quiz - questions about medical application of [Removed] concepts","At the beginning of lecture, I go around the classroom and ask students how their weekend was, what their plans are for the next weekend, check in if anyone went to the game, going to [Removed], also letting them know they should embrace the cool activities [Removed] has to offer!","This seems like a good point to add in the post [Removed] debrief to ensure I include a positive aspect   to that process. \n\n Along the lines of \" This is a challenging course and you as a class have learned a significant amount of material in a short time period and should be proud of yourselves for your accomplishments so far. Make sure to take a moment to reflect on what is working well in your study strategies and commit to building on those habits as we enter the final stretch of the course. \"","I talk about the importance of hearing people say things in different ways, because some phrasings will resonate better sith some people than others.   I also talk about the importance of being engaged and participating for learning, even if an answer offered is incorrect.   Being incorrect is a part of learning.","I combine working independently to mean that students can work with their neighbors. When I give an [Removed] problem, I ask students to read the question and then work with their neighbors on the problem. It is only after a few minutes of them working on the problem do I then start the conversation of how the problem may be solved with the whole class.","I will provide a mid - semester survey to all of my students and discuss in class how I've used it in the past and what I will do when I read their responses.   I also share common themes during a following class that gives them an idea of what I gathered from their responses.   I will do this in a couple of weeks.","in some cases when the students have a situation which is not recognized as an emergency by [Removed] I am willing to offer help / accommodation","Working through old exam problems in class","I'm actually not sure on how to do this in my course. I provide worksheets to complete with code during lectures and I also release a key at the end of a week.

Also, students must complete lab assignments in assigned groups each week.","As we start digging into more challenging materials, I will have more time for students to think independently on how to use code to achieve what we want to get. After some independent thinking, I will ask them to share with a partner.","In class I ask them to think how their own life reflects topics we study in ecology. \n\n E.g. [Removed] 5 : \n \" How does living in group ( with room mates ) has both costs and benefits. \" \n I.e. in behavioral ecology, we study cost and benefits of group living for animal species, and how the net benefit results in the optimum group size. \n\n E.g. [Removed] 10 : \n  \" What are resources that you have in your day - to - day life? \" \n I.e. resources are shared and can be used up by others.

They are told this in every assignment and throughout most classes.","Post an assignment on making concept maps and flow - charts to learn about biochemical pathways today to have them complete next week before exam 3.","I'm offering extra credit opportunities based on group work. There will be options for group work during discussion sections, but student buy - in for this has been low. I talk about belonging and community.","We did a personal values activity during the class that we talked about careers.

Then discussed how knowing your values can help you decide what careers would be a good fit for them.","my in - class quizzes","In my syllabus there is explicit text on how I handle missed / late work due to emergencies. I also individually check with students that have missed significant assignments. \n I usually ask them if everything is going well and that I am concerned about them.","Over the course of the semester, students conduct research about the soil microbiome using a soil sample they collected at one of [Removed]'s field stations.   Students examine the soil bacteria they isolate from their soil sample to look for evidence of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic production.   Students calculate the percentage of isolates that are resistant to two different antibiotics and the percentage of isolates that produce antibiotics.   Students conduct other biochemical assays as well to learn more about their soil isolates. At the end of the semester, students present their results to the class using a Research Poster.   I give them instructions for making these calculations and for presenting their in a poster.","After midterm2 when I showed the results and the class distribution I emphasized that students should be proud of themselves for how they are doing so far and encouraged them to keep the momentum going through the rest of the semester.","During office hours I let the students and encourage them to answer each other questions","All students had the experience to work with a peer outside of class at least once for the semester.","Since we are only at a third of the semester, there is still plenty of time for students to succeed.

It can be difficult to assess if such a large group of students is understanding each topic, and it's usually mixed. I've stated during class, as much as felt natural, that I would love to talk to them more in my office hours.","Students are directed to reach out to the teaching team in a timely manner to discuss the issue. I try to work with student schedules to facilitate make - up exams whenever possible. For homeworks, I had [Removed] create a token system where any student can give themselves a 24 hour extension on assignments up to three times per semester.","I not only mention to students the times that the instructional team is available throughout the week, but I make it clear that we are there to help them learn the material and that we are happy to help them.","Tutorials, links to other sites","I try to wait several seconds after asking questions during lecture and ask for students across different areas in the classroom to participate in the question answers.","By using examples and showing how the skills which was used to solve physics problem can be used to address the real life challenges like job hunting / graduate school applications","In [Removed] [Removed], students spend the entire semester studying soil bacteria to learn more about the soil microbiome as well as determine whether soil isolates are resistant to antibiotics or producing antibiotics.   They are also learning fundamental lab techniques like [Removed] and microscopy.   I hope that students recognize that their understanding of these topics and mastery of these techniques are allowing them to contribute to meaningful research.","We have talked about [Removed] learning center and [Removed].    We will start to talk about course schedules and looking at degree progress   in the next few classes.","The grade in my class is attendance based.    We communicate with students at the beginning of the semester that if they miss a course they can meet with the TA to make up the class.    During the class that the student misses, the TA emails them to schedule a make up time to meet.","I have several contingency policies in regard to students missing classes and homework discussed on the syllabus. I have also mentioned to students that I will work with them to schedule a make - up exam if they are sick on the day of a midterm exam.","I emphasize this after every midterm and often after unit quizzes.   I also talk about this in the review sessions that happen before midterms.","Discussion time ( 3 - 5min ) with students neighbors during in - class quiz \n 3 Homework discussion sessions per week ( TA, LAs ) \n Exam review sessions run by TA and LAs","LA supported peer instruction using [Removed] to capture answers.","I share my personal stories","Over the course of the entire semester, students work in group of 3 - 4 to design and conduct experiments using a soil sample collected from one of [Removed]'s Field Stations.","By sending reminders about scheduled office hours / TA and LA help sessions and repeating it once in 2 weeks at least to make sure they are aware, also emphasizing on availability outside of those scheduled times in case it has conflict with their schedule","I am not sure how I will approach this yet. For me the word meaningful is not as important. I would rather prioritize what they want to accomplish in the future while acknowledging that there are many different paths that can be followed.","There are many opportunities in the course : students complete lab assignments in groups that I assigned at the beginning of the semester, students work in groups to complete quick exercises during lecture, students can choose to work on a research project either independently or collaboratively.","Using real - life examples","We discuss the process of learning, have pre - class questions that attempt to highlight growth, use growth mindset language, etc.","In every class, there were a few times I asked the students to work on a problem with their neighbors.   Occasionally I'd say the best way to learn is from your friends.","Lots of talking to each other, at many points in class ( and before / after ).","I provide a link in my canvas home page with access to the different arrays of resources available at the university. This is also mentioned in my syllabus.","Send another well - being message through [Removed]. \n The week of the 13th. \n Last time I mentioned the university resources like x, y, and z that can help you cope with life challenges. I want to make sure you receive the support you need and reach out to me if you need additional support from me. We will discuss options and find accommodations that can relieve your situation. Feel free to reach out to me.","In the upcoming units, I plan to show more graphs and experimental data to help the students think about the content in a different way. For example, graphs could help exemplify the relationship between pressure and volume, or volume and temperature, within the Gas Laws unit, better than merely looking at a formula.","We do ice breakers at the beginning of almost all of our classes.    We discuss different study strategies and study groups.","I sent a congratulations message to students after their second exam that showed significant improvement of many students. I also said one day in class that we have come a long way since the beginning of the semester and learned much about genetics. \n October \n My message : Most students improved, some by large and others by smaller, but any upward change is an improvement and an occasion to celebrate! Do not compare yourself to others but focus on your own progress. Do not get discouraged if you're not satisfied with your performance but feel free to see me or any TA.","I am planning to invite students to my music shows ( free to attend and near campus )! I know that a lot of them are playing an instrument or enjoy live music so it would be a great way for them to learn about my music. I also share posts from [Removed] for hiking ideas or win free tickets to a show.","The course uses materials developed by the [Removed] [Removed] Program, an international effort to discover antibiotic - producing bacteria.   Students learn about the antibiotic resistance crisis and test their soil isolates for resistance to antibiotics.","There is graphical or numerical data in each of my lessons. \n I do emphasize the importance of these models. \n The next few week is mellow, but in week 6 - 7 by the end of the week, we will be covering models of delayed density dependence, which reqires abstract thinking. \n\n I usually explain why mathematical models are important to understand the physical world and to make prediction","This course is based on attendance so we focus on the students attending class.","I have been and plan to continue to include examples from my research, other relevant research, and the world around us of applications of the course material where possible to do so.","Actually, this is not related to this particular project, but a different project. \n I am using muddiest point polls every week to assess what students perceive as difficult and create a handout / study guide for those topic. It's one way in which instructors can use AI in teaching. \n\n I do this every week. Polls are open Monday - Wednesday for content from the previous week. \n I create the handout by Friday. \n I need to prompt them to review the materials and give details on what they did not understand. \n E.g. if I have spent three lectures on' competition' and they just say' competition' it's hard to know what they don't understand.","Students are hesitant to ask question, I usually encourage them to discuss it with their neighbors, talking to each other before sharing the question with rest of the class is very helpful to students","As we start analyzing messy data, I will discuss different approaches to analyze the same data, addressing any decisions that may impact data ethics. It is very important to recognize our own biases.","Students are always placed in pairs, small groups, or split class for discussions. They have an opportunity to debrief on the readings, share their thoughts and opinions, and present experiences from their own life as it relates to the topic or reading at hand.","Instapolls, typically 2 - -7 questions per class.","Send an email to students who did poorly on their first midterm exam. \n I already did it in one course. I'll do the same with two other class sections of another course after their grades are released. \n I know you can improve and grow with effort no matter how you did on this exam. This is just one snapshot of your performance in this class, but we need to have the right strategies moving forward.","When conducting peer instruction, I allow several minutes ( or more ) for students to work together. I signal one minute left when about 75 - 80 % of students have answered. For impromptu questions, I estimate how long students need to discuss a specific question ( 20 - 90s ), allow for contributions, and usually pause for questions after a discussion.","I include pictures and a research question that we use the statistical analysis method to answer for each example they see in class.   The course packet also contains a set of problems that show how the methods we learn can be used to answer real - world data analysis questions.","When we release the first quiz grades, I will spend time in class showing students the most frequently missed questions.","I take attendance with [Removed] [Removed] but more importantly it gives me an opportunity to know where everyone is at during lecture. I use a mix of open - ended questions and multiple choice questions.","I use [Removed] booking for [Removed] students","I give students the questions about their work during lab several days before labs begin.   They go into lab knowing the data they need to collect and the questions they will need to answer with their data.   I do this each week.   Students should have plenty of time to reflect on their data before answering questions.","The resources has been introduced on syllabus, reminding the students about them about mid - semester, using office hours to talk to students about the activities","We have not had the opportunity yet to tackle this issue in [Removed] [Removed] in terms of mistakes I may have made when lecturing. I do tackle students' misconceptions weekly.","Students can redo exam problems using a specific structured problem solving approach to earn 1/2 of the missed points back.","For every problem I do in class, we \" check the answer \" by trying to interpret the meaning of the answer. Sometimes I do it for them, sometimes I have the class provide answers. In office hours I make every student do this for every problem.","Provide and encourage extra problem resources","I messaged individual students in all my courses who didn't do well on their weekly quizzes after unlocking the quizzes so they can make a second attempt ( which was available to all students but was not used by everyone ). I also did this to students who didn't submit their homework assignments on time and extended their due date. \n October and November \n I see that you did not do so well on the quiz. I extended your quiz until 12 pm today so please give it another try to make improvement. And feel free to reach out to me if there is anything I can do to help you thrive in this course. \n","We shared that their experiences brought them to [Removed] [Removed] for a reason. That they are capable of succeeding and that they will be successful post - first year of study. This encouragement was shared weekly and in [Removed] messaging.","I have designed [Removed] 206L so that students have a chance to learn a technique ( and make mistakes ) and then, the following week, they conduct the experiment ( and hopefully not make mistakes ).   I emphasize, whenever possible, that making mistakes is a natural part of learning, and that students are not penalized for making mistakes.   Students are given the opportunity to practice a variety of techniques such as serial dilutions, microscopy, Gram - staining, and [Removed] and gel electrophoresis before they use the techniques to examine their soil bacteria.","Besides the [Removed] survey, I will also ask students to complete a midterm survey to collect information about how they currently feel about the course, what aspects helped them learn so far, if they have any suggestions for improving the course this semester, and what they could do themselves to better succeed in this course ( still plenty of time for improvement! ).","Pause my lecturing with practice problems students complete in small groups that they formed at the beginning of the semester.   I do this every class day, and the students expect it because these activities are labeled \" group practice \" or I have written on the slides \" complete the following in your group... \".","In some sense this survey is giving them an opportunity to provide feedback and is an important element of our initiative this semester. \n\n I would also like to add some targeted in class instapoll queries after the second midterm that can also provide an opportunity to get a sense of the state of the class.","I make statements that everyone can be successful in Physics","We will be discussing how they prepared for test 1 as we move to test 2","We made an effort to share that challenges will come up throughout the semester. We made sure to share positive thoughts at crucial times and share reaffirming messaging.","When students reach out via email and/or in - person that something has happened, preventing them from attending class, taking an in - class quiz, or showing up for an exam, I work with a main TA to help convey next available steps. We have an email template, and I provide a time between the last class and the final exam to make up class exams if University - approved documentation is received. There are also a number of in - class polling and quiz drops to help account for students' life circumstances.","Focused on application of methods to answering real research questions based on their interests.   I've done this during lecture and on assignments.","I have a some check - in questions where students reflect on their learning strategies","I employ zombie problems on my exams. This semester midterms have 13 questions over new material plus 3 questions that are similar to low performing questions from the prior midterm. Students who go back to learn the process have the opportunity to improve their subsequent midterm score through demonstrating their learning over old material in addition to new.","For every prelecture topic, I ask students to provide a question or comment about it. I then use these to select examples or connections to bring up in class. I also provide my own comment or question about it, and do the same. I also occasionally have the TA or LAs contribute. I also occasionally post articles with connections in [Removed] but I don't know if anyone reads them.","Students were asked to share their ideas and experiences in most classes and weekly assignments. They were asked to share verbally as small groups and then as a class.","When lecturing, I like to plan specific questions at the start of certain topics that I pose to the class before we learn the specific formula / method for solving them.   I believe I allow them enough time to think of their own answers before moving on.","We give students activities and class discussions with opportunities for students to think and process. There are no right or wrong answers, and they do not get penalized if they don't participate nor receive extra points if they do.","The TAs will walk them through the exam this week in discussion.","We take students to the library so that they know how to use the [Removed] database for research. We connect them with [Removed] guidance as well as encourage them to attend writing support centers on campus.","I plan to share with students that is nice to have a professional plan but realize that these plans can change and this is fine. \n I would like to do this in the coming weeks ( if time allows as this course is content heavy ) \n I am not sure yet which words I will use.","We connect students with campus resources. They are encouraged to connect with mentors so that they can ask questions about college or their related field.","Invited students to participate in survey and providing extra credit / bonus","After the second midterm I spoke to students as burgeoning professionals who will have to solve problems, an essential skills developed in introductory physics courses.","I'm teaching two pedagogy courses so reflection on personal learning goes hand - in - hand with the course content.","I ask \" what are your questions? \" and then have a long pause, frequently during class.   I also specifically ask for suggestions or answers to questions that I pose from students who haven't talked yet that day or that week.","In labs and homework assignments, I use data from researchers of diverse backgrounds and give the students information about those scientists.   I also include a picture or video of those researchers in [Removed] or on the lab handout.","Students always had the opportunity to provide feedback, through office hours and being open and inviting during class.","Shared a belonging story about how I dropped out of law school because it wasn't a good fit for me.","I try open the class up for questions when ever we change topics.    And allow then to come ask questions after class.","In my notecard assignment and in the first week, I required students to get to know each other and find things in common. I encourage / allow students to work in groups on assignments.","I will talk about learning to study after a tough exam","I asked clicker questions and reflection questions that help students develop abilities and skills that can be applied beyond the course. \n Month of October \n Reflection question on exam : We have learned about several important experiments in the second unit. Choose one of the following experiments, describe the purpose and method of that experiment to a family member as your audience. Be clear and concise to help their understanding.","While at the beginning of each lecture I try to connect the physics concepts that we are going to learn to real - world applications, from time to time during the course I also mention to students that they should think about the skills that they are learning in the course and how they may be able to use those skills to solve complex problems in the world.","We use literature that focuses on experiences that they mostly may have lived. These experiences are based on real - world applications with relationship to education, an experience that they all have gone through as k-12 students and will continue to experience as college students.","I emphasize the course structure that includes Replacement Exams, vs. a cumulative final exam. Students can learn from their first time taking an exam on Unit 1 material, for example, and then replace that exam grade at the end of the semester. Students can learn from past mistakes and misconceptions, and conquer the Unit 1 material the second time around.","Each day in my large lecture course, students receive 1 - 3 questions where they work with their neighbors and Learning Assistants to interpret and solve the problem. Its an essential component of learning in my introductory courses.","I will mention to students that with practice they are all capable of doing well in the course.","The whole course is centered on how students can conduct authentic, relevant research, and how their work contributes to the ongoing battle against antibiotic resistant bacteria.   This is discussed in the syllabus.   During the first week of lab, students read articles and watch videos that emphasize this.","We talk about all of the different CNS majors in this course.   Specifically during our advising courses.","We are doing this by using [Removed] [Removed] during lecture. So far, I have not used instapoll in every lecture. I am planning to use it more often in future lectures.","In - class quiz questions.","Most days in class for my large intro course I try to highlight at least one real world aspect of the physics we are learning. Often this can be small examples of similar systems to what they're seeing in a demonstration.","When appropriate, I will talk about my research as a grad student at [Removed].   I recently told a group' When I was grad student, my advisor told me that 50 % of my experiments would fail for some reason or another. I spent a year trying to infect a plant with a fungus and never succeeded in making that happen.'   I don't always say this to student groups- just those students who seem frustrated when they are having issues growing their bacteria.","Students learn about the antibiotic resistance crisis and explore the soil microbiome to determine whether soil isolates are resistant to antibiotics.   Students learn about the antibiotic resistance crisis by reading articles ( both popular and scholarly ) and watching videos and then answering questions.   This occurs on a weekly basis over the course of the semester.   For example, one of the learning objectives is' Explain why the antibiotic resistance crisis is one of the biggest threats to human health.' Students then watch several videos and review information from the [Removed] and the [Removed] and then answer multiple - choice and short answer questions. \n","I would want to ensure students had enough background information. Then, I'd pose a more challenging type of problem or scenario they haven't seen explicitly yet in - class. They could discuss ways to solve the problem in small groups.","I make time to remind students of services like the physics coaching tables, teaching team drop - in hours, and [Removed]. Since we just finished the first midterm, [Removed] is particularly important to bring up for assistance with studying or note taking services.","Students receive a check in every week. They can provide feedback on their weekly assignments or overall class composition.","By comparing the difficulty level of the materials covered in different midterm exams and showing them why it is important to recongnize even a small improvement","Readings are mostly new to students, They are always applying knowledge that they have not covered in their reflections and other assignments. This happens on a weekly basis.","In the syllabus, in a linked video, in class","Utilizing office hour in order to engage and encourage students to work in small groups","During the first lecture, I emphasize the course content is highly relevant to those pursuing a STEM career. I stated that it won't be easy to master this content the first time around. I said \" Once you master this content, you can pursue a career in... \" \" I ask them : why choosing a challenging major? \"","Over the course of the semester, students work together to build a Research Poster that they will present to the class at the end of the semester.   Here are the instructions I provide them : \n\n Your group will present your research at the end of the semester using a poster.   A poster is a visual communication tool that allows you to present your research in a clear, concise, graphic format.   A poster can be created at any stage of your research project.   In fact, creating a poster can aid in focusing your research.   A link to the [Removed] Templates you should use to create your Final Poster are on the [Removed] Page of [Removed].","I use real - life ( nature, medical ) examples in my in - class quizzes","We have weekly challenges that promote students to use campus resources.    There was an assignment during registration week that required a student use a campus resource and answer 4 questions about it.    I reminded them about the assignment every week in class to give them ample time to complete it.","I have several policies that allow students some flexibility for when life events happen.   They are allowed to miss one lab without any explanation needed.   I drop the lowest grade for several assignments.   This is clearly explained in the syllabus.","I tell my students about my own experience of failure and growth","I mention how important it is for me to have them in office hours and make sure to re invite them","Retest for each of 3 exams, my main [Removed] thing","When we talk about study stratigies we discuss working with classmates.    I openly ask the group if anyone wants to share things that work for them to share with the class.","Welcome and share mistakes. \n In informal Q&amp;A \n Thank you for sharing your thoughts. While this is a common misconception, it reveals our thinking and helps us learn from our mistakes. I make similar mistakes as well.","For the mental health class, I will have a student guest speaker from [Removed] [Removed] to talk about their program, provide a link to a meditation video in [Removed], and show a video about gratitude featuring a Black woman.   When I talk about seeking counseling I will mention that students have different views on the value and acceptability of therapy.   For the class on establishing relationships with faculty and staff, I will talk about cultural beliefs related to faculty etiquette.   For every class, I plan to facilitate discussion questions that allow students to present their unique viewpoints and remind them that everyone views class material through the lens of their own experience and identities.","During the first lecture, I shared my journey to [Removed]. I share stories about myself how to decide a research direction. I encourage students to visit me during the office hours. Except for right before a midterm, not many students have come to my office hours.","I've added into my course a large variety of example datasets of things that hopefully are of interest to them.   When we learn a new analysis method, I tie it to answer real - world analysis questions.","We will have the second midterm soon, I would like to run through the problems that students struggled with the most and work through them to identify common mistakes and how to avoid them in future exams and assignments.","During lectures I connect the topics to life science applications. I mention to students how the basic physics that we are learning can be used to model more complex systems like the human body as most students in my classes are doing a degree in the life sciences.","Historical references, e.g. [Removed] confronting his high school teachers with a new idea ( already discussed 10/1 ), or [Removed] seeing a contradiction in [Removed]'s [Removed] that allows [Removed] waves. \n I say things like \" Great discoveries often come from realizing the exceptions to former rules, or by stepping back and getting a new perspective. \""]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>practice_id<\/th>\n      <th>practice_wording<\/th>\n      <th>or.inst_priority<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"practice_id","targets":1},{"name":"practice_wording","targets":2},{"name":"or.inst_priority","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
