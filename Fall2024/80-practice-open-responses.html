feel very welcomed and feel that I can progress in this course because of Dr. [Removed]'s belief in all of us. I also enjoy genetics as a subject!","I would say it is manageable but you do need to actually understand the concepts.","It is a lovely introduction to the principls of chemistry.","","It is time consuming and if you have not taken math or dislike math, you have to put more time into it.","[Removed] is challenging but fair. If you really understand the homework's you should do well on the tests.","This course has easy to understand lecture material, but the content itself is very hard. The lead instructor is very helpful and engaging in the lectures but one must stay on top of the material ( reading, homework, practice ) to do well.","This course is very helpful in understanding fundamental processes / concepts in chemistry. The Professor and her TA's provide adequate resources to help you succeed in the course, and if I could recommend a professor for this class, I would say take it with Dr. [Removed]!","I really enjoy [Removed], it's a lot like learning how to solve puzzles and it's really interesting!","Intro level chem course and pretty easy with some difficult tests and quizzes. If effort is put in, you will be rewarded","It is very low stress, but the lecture can be hard to stay focused in.","It is a bit of a challenging course, there is no doubt in that. Especially if you haven't taken a previous [Removed] course - like me - there is a bit of a learning curve, but with enough work and studying, it's a very fun and interesting class.","I would recommend them to take the course. It is helpful.","This course centers around introductory biology lab techniques. These techniques are used to complete experiments in preparation for a larger research project over the soil microbiome and potential antibiotics in the soil.","That is provides a positive learning experience and there are multiple opportunities to succeed and pass.","Difficult but interesting","It is very lecture heavy so you need to make sure to go to lecture in person to fully understand the material. Also, since the class is only twice a week, studying outside of class is definitely needed to succeed.","This course is an introduction to statistical methods of analysis and how to use [Removed] to perform statistical tests and evaluations.","This course is fast paced and required additional practice outside of class.","We started by taking soil samples from a spot at a nature center and have gone from there taking various tests / observations and using various tools. A lot of this course is participation based and teamwork, but there is also work outside of class to ensure understanding / comprehension.","Hard, yet interesting. You have to stay on top of this class. You don't have the chance to fall behind even a little bit.","This course requires a lot of hard and preparation for everyday class in order to gain understanding. Also, a lot of application skills are needed in order to answer the quiz/ test questions which makes it a little more difficult than the typical class.","The course is difficult if you do not put in the time to help yourself learn it in addition to your professor's teaching.","The workload is fair, the lectures might be a bit confusing but there's extra material on the [Removed] that could help clear things up, the professor is kind and fair, and learning R code isn't as difficult or boring as one might think.","Its a general physics course that integrates alot of fairly complex algebra. As long as you keep up and do the homework's you should be fine","The course is very ace - able considering the support from the teacher and the TA. The course material is not fast, nor is it too slow. As long as you put in the needed effort, you can easily do well in this class.","I highly recommend. It is a great beginner course that does not set high chemistry background expectations and has a great flow to make you feel comfortable","With the lectures and the modules the information is relatively easy to learn. The math gets confusing though.","mathematically challenging","Definitely manageable if you keep up with assignments. Make sure to use question types and practice tests.","I would describe this course as self - paced and memorization heavy.","This course is on general chemistry, in which you will learn about all the components that general chemistry contains.","Learning the basics of physics. Not too hard if paying attention and attending extra supplemental instruction.","This course is independent study, and can be difficult. Dr. [Removed] does a great job in explaining what's on the exams and quizzes but to succeed you need to study on your own because her classes are like review.","It is very straightforward when it comes to the information and content, though you also have to put in the time to try to thoroughly understanding the homeworks.","This course gives you a general overview of how the electric field interacts with the world. It is very interesting and rewarding if you put the time into it. With that being said, it is a decent amount of work, nothing too crazy. If you participate in all the stuff, you will succeed.","This course is very comprehensive and allows its students to learn critical lab skills through physical training.","It's an interactive biology lab where you work as a group of four students to study soil bacteria.","applied [Removed] with physics concepts","For this class you have to put in the outside work and time to grasp a further understanding of the materials. Lectures should just be practice or reviews but through the learning modules you should have been introduced to the content.","Reading is intensive, and information - heavy, but it can be interesting if you are passionate about the subject.","It an amazing course so far, Dr. [Removed] is such a great lecturer. She helps us so much by providing so much material to help us understand the concept better and also wants her students to thrive.","Chemistry is fairly straightforward if you attend all the lectures. The department is very put together in ta way where you can form study groups with other students who have different lecturers.","If you complete the learning modules and review them during lecture, the course should be fairly easy.","The course goes over a lot of processes involving our genetic makeup and how we pass it on through generations.","It's a beginner course handling technical lab things but incorporating real - world biology instead of textbook material","It's a course that is dedicated to analyzing or making data.","It has a lot of information but is manageable if you manage your time and study well","A course that goes over mainly chromosomes and inheritance and probabilities.","Lots of probability, not much memorization, solid structure for assignments and materials, good organization, informative syllabus.","easy but annoying. be prepared to be forced to work with people you won't like and disorganization","It is a data science class that requires you to code using r studio, you often make graphs and analyze rows and columns of data.","Analyzing data through R studio in order to analyze   trends to better positively impact given data.","This course is fluid and in a flipped classroom style. There is alot of content within this course.","The content is relatively easy, especially if you have previous experience with [Removed] That being said, it is very lab and project heavy.","This [Removed] class with [Removed] builds on the fundamentals on chemistry in fun and accessible way. Although there are weekly quizzes and exams, the difficulty is manageable.","It's pretty difficult. The exams are pretty hard because she uses a lot of small details to try to trick you in the multiple choice questions. Attendance is mandatory because she does instapolls and they count for a lot of your grade. Discussion attendance is also mandatory although it isn't really that helpful. There aren't that many exams so there isn't a lot of room for error and there's a lot of content on each exam.","Learning more advanced foundational chemistry concepts","It's a bit like regular pre AP chem but more.","This course is an introductory approach to chemistry but requires basic prerequisites in math and science that should've been covered in high school.","I would practice is key and also understanding the equations.","This course teaches you skills that will aid the rest of your education.","The course is not too difficult or overwhelming, and it helps you understand how to properly use R studio.","There are modules to complete before each class and one quiz every week. The tests are based off of 25 question types that make it very easy to study.","It is a good chemistry course that moves at a pace that is easy to understand.","It is a challenging course that requires a lot of time on your own to understand the material but the TAs are helpful so if you put in the work it's doable.","This course clearly helps break down challenging concepts making the material feel relevant and approachable. The professor keeps it engaging with well - structured explanations and visuals, helping you build a solid foundation in the subject.","It is a course rich in information and you will learn a lot of concepts and be expected to apply them into real life applications.","It is a very challenging course, especially if you have weak chemistry background from high school. The transitioning is hard, but once you adapt to the concept increasing in difficulty and the teaching styles of the professor, you will earn a good / decent grade.","It is challening but do - able","Pretty chill, would recommend the professor","I like like this course because it gives me time to destress. I also enjoy this class because there is a lot of people in it who are in the same major as me.","Applying biology by using lab techniques and hands on experience.","It can be rough at first but, it gets easier as you go along.","It is really just chemistry. I went into it knowing absolutely no chemistry. It's not too bad but the weekly quizzes blow.","This course is one of my most interesting lab's I've ever taken. It invites you to think about real - world problems instead of just conducting useful research procedures. I love it.","The course is fine, it's just a lecture. You'll just be taking notes and doing exams every once in a while.","This class is somewhat fast - paced, but every grade you make is essentially up to how much you study outside of class. [Removed] has lectures on slides and includes quizzes in class, but it is not a handful, so it is good.","You will be in [Removed] a lot. It will suck, but not bad","This course is an introductory class about science stats.","This course is an introduction to statistics and statistical tests, and the knowledge learned in this course is especially applicable for STEM students or those conducting research","This class is an introductory chemistry course and [Removed] provides alot of resources for you to be successful. Caudills presentations are really easy to follow and very useful.","This course is great for improving understanding of physics principles, but it requires a lot of reading and work, so I would only recommend it if you are prepared for that.

Not specialized to any specific field.","As long as you practice, you should be able to get it.","This course is a great course to take. The professor is very kind, understanding, and relating towards students. He teaches with a passion, while simultaneously getting through to the students with the information he is teaching. He makes it very easy to understand and answers all questions that the students have.","We learn methods of data wrangling and analysis using R","[Removed] [Removed] 301 at [Removed] [Removed] is an introductory chemistry course that covers the fundamentals of chemical principles, focusing on topics like atomic structure, bonding, and stoichiometry, with a strong emphasis on problem - solving and applying concepts to real - world scenarios. It's a great starting point for anyone needing a solid foundation in chemistry, especially if you're considering a science or health - related major. \n\n\n\n\n","In this course you learn the basics of chemistry, which includes learning about molecular structures and   also how chemical reactions work.","This is an enjoyable course, with a lot of outside - of - class work but it is doable.","We use experimental procedures to study bacteria isolates we collected from a soil sample.","It can be a pretty demanding course, but there are plenty of resources and guidance to get through it and enough opportunity to bring up a bad grade as well.","The course is fairly straightforward and simple.","This course is a fun intro lab that prepares you for further ones \n","A chemistry course that lays the foundation for the following years on topics that will be used to lay out the coursework for the next coming years.","Really enjoyable course overall, only main issues are the labs because of the time constraint placed but everything else is smooth.","It is a very memory based learning course with somewhat difficult rigor so far.","It's a good course to take but can be really hard at times.","[Removed] is an introduction to chemistry that helps build the foundations for broader concepts in chemistry.","I would describe [Removed] [Removed] as a class that is not as easy a student would assume it would be. It is a course that will need personal commitment to the learning and assistance from your TA.","Simple, well - paced course that sharpens up your basic chemistry skills.","A very assignment heavy but worth it lab.","This course is a continuation of genetics learned in [Removed] I and [Removed], reaching much further into probability, gene interactions, and molecular interactions in genetics. It is structured into lecture and active practice, where there are a variety of ways to get credit for active practice such as discussion, interactive textbooks, or interactive videos.","This course is great and allows students to actually learn instead of just memorizing content.","It's interesting but you have to put in effort into the course to be able to understand it because going to just lecture will not be enough.","This course is a brief run - through of general chemistry topics.","This course is a good way to get back into physics. This course is a collaborative and good learning environment to learn something that seems stressful."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>instructor_id<\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.course_description<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"instructor_id","targets":1},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":2},{"name":"or.course_description","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

We were encouraged to do well, but also not beat ourselves up if we don't end up with a desirable grade.","","","","Dr. [Removed] really emphasizes the idea to understand a concept and not to memorize it when going over material in class. I believe this is helpful in the future outside of college, because memorizing information, such as for medical school, does not necessarily mean that I will be able to apply it to real life instances.","","","","","","","In the course we submit quiz reflections in which we evaluate our study strategies. We also reflect on how we can do better studying next quiz.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","She would talk about how we could use the skills in this course to further our future careers. For example, the critical thinking and logic skills we learn from this class could be applied to many of our fields outside of this course.","","The professor always has us discussing our thoughts and answers with out peers next to us.","","","","","","He writes hand written notes and allows us to follow along while copying his notes. He also uploads them later on if we want to look at them.","She puts problems up and asks [Removed] to work with our peers to solve them","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","On course [Removed], we can post any questions we may have. She always encourages us to check that out and talk to others, help others, or ask questions ourselves.","","","","","","","Sometimes she will post extra things that aren't on the quiz just in case people want to have extra knowledge","","Every class, Dr. [Removed] provides reassurance to students who may not have a background in physics. I am one of these students, and feel this is important, as the first two years are a time of \" levelling \", where all students will leave with the same base knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","In the course Dr. [Removed] explained how physics applies to our diverse careers.","","","","","","","","","","","","","On class give an example question and ask student do the math and get the answer","","","","","","","In every single class lecture the instructor has the entire class submit insta - polls throughout the class. After each instapoll she also asks for students to volunteer their answers. Additionally, throughout the lecture she has the class respond to activities.","Dr. [Removed] provides review slides for each unit, covering every relevant topic and example problems for each. She made sure to address these resources early on in the course so we had as much time as possible to make use of them. After first mentioning these study resources, Dr. [Removed] has made many more mentions of them to ensure that we don't forget to make use of them.","","","","","","","She has all of the notes and lectures posted on canvas. And study materials","","Most recently, we've had some project days where the professor walks around and helps any students   with their projects. That ranges from coding in R, to giving advice on how to analyze data, while still allowing the student to be able to implement advice their self and make their own decisions and learn from her help.","","","","","Dr. [Removed] always answers question in class and outside of class. She always makes sure we understand the topic before moving on.","","","","","","","","","","","We were going over the syllabus \n The first day \n She explained that having the right methods are the base of physics","Everything is group based and thus forces collaboration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","After learning something new, the instructor would provide time for students to discuss concepts with peers around them. After a few minutes, the instructor would bring everyone's attention back to the lecture and move on.","","","","","","I'm not too sure what the specifics he's done for this but my idea of interests is just like movies or tv shows just cause those are what my interests are. It's possible he's shared and I didn't notice / remember or maybe with others who are naturally more aligned with his interests have noticed specifics about his interests. But regardless, I don't find his specific interests that important to learning ; even though it may help “ humanization ” he is already a very human and kind person and very generous and open as possible.","","","The professor has told us it would be good to engage in research","","","","","","It was a good moment","After the having a moment to chat with peers, about a question located in the slides. Dr. G will ask for people's opinion on their choice of answer and their reasoning behind it.","","","","","","","","","As test dates approach, she reminds and encourages students who need accommodations to visit the office and sign up.","","","She does this before every class. There is always a slide starting with helpful information to start us off.","","","","","","Our professor emphasizes looking over the learning targets to help us understand what will be on the exam. This strategy helps me perform well.","","She encourages students to ask questions in office hours and go to them if we need support. Also to use the supports offered on canvas and on the [Removed] chem website.","","","","","","","","talks about how physics relates to us walking to class or him walking from his office","He will pose a question in which there are several ways to get to the right answer. He will then map out all of the different ways. However, this was overwhelming and often overcomplicated the material.","","","The professor said that it's helpful for the teaching staff to receive student feedback in order to improve their courses. This happened when the professor introduced this survey as an extra credit opportunity.","","","","","","","","There was a whole chemistry prep course. We had to either pass a chemistry assessment or complete the modules before taking the course. It had basically all of my highschool chemistry class' educational content. It was quite useful, you could take mini assessments on specific stuff to know what you need to touch up on too. And there was loads of information next to it if you didn't perform well.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Very early on into the class, maybe even the first day, he described his journey towards becoming a professor. He explained his move to [Removed], and how he continued his education at [Removed] [Removed]. It made it feel more personal when we knew he was in our positions once.","","","","","We had different topics covered that were relevant. For example, the city of [Removed] came to speak to us about their daily work lives which applies to what we are covering in class.","","","","Around 2 weeks ago, we took our exam for Unit 1. This being our first exam, it was challenging. However, [Removed] offered help by looking at the exam and not counting problems where the wording may not have been the best. She then told us we would have a chance to show we mastered the topic before the end of the course.","","We always have about a minute or two which is reasonable for the question difficulty.","","When Professor [Removed] talked about how he worked on a telescope in [Removed] I m pretty sure I remember him expressing how he never thought he would do that in his life and that your career can take you to unexpected places. Even after talking about how he became a teacher and researcher at [Removed] it just kind of showed me that anything can happen in the future after college.","I believe professor caudill allows for makeup replacement exams, but I'm not sur rif you can resubmit regular assignment","","","","","","","","","","","","",""]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>or.practice_describe<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"or.practice_describe","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

lectures are very fast - paced and it is hard to understand and digest the materials.","She is the nicest and most understanding professor!","I have come back to Professor [Removed] to take [Removed] [Removed] after taking [Removed] [Removed] I really like her teaching style and easy communication, and I was so happy that I'd be able to take another class with her.","The graduate TA is great, there just isn't much opportunity for them to implement what was previously asked about.","I like Dr. [Removed], his lectures are good and I think that he is a very caring professor.","N / [Removed] The instructor has been great so far.","She does a great job!","huge class so I don't blame Dr. [Removed] for not being able to check in with every student","Not really, this class is pretty standard and doesn't require much involvement from diverse perspectives or whatnot, since its an analytics course. There are only so many ways different perspectives can perceive data.","Overall Dr. [Removed] is an amazing and kind professor that is invested in the success of her students. I always love when professors are like Dr. [Removed] as it gives me more motivation to work harder in their class and do better.","Nothing I can think of at the moment","I like that she lets us do examples ourself before she does it, it helps me realize what I don't understand.","The instructor is very accommodating and his office hours are very beneficial for doing well in the course.","I think she is a great professor, however, I think that she can accept questions more often because I feel like she doesn't because she doesn't have a lot of time to.","In general I like that the instructor injects his personality and personal life / experiences into the lessons as it really humanizes him and shows that he's not just a person feeding us information, but a person who is deeply passionate about the subject material.","Sometimes the professor can be a little unclear on expectations when asking us to do questions on our own. I think it would be helpful for her to sometimes nudge us in the right direction before giving us time to work on it. Overall though, professor [Removed] is very approachable and kind.","She cares about her students and makes an effort to reach out if she sees that we are struggling in the class. I did poorly on my first exam and she reached out to offer support and encourage me to attend office hours so she can help me get on track for the next exam.","[Removed] is an amazing instructor who clearly cares about her students, both inside and outside of the classroom. She's very encouraging and represents a strong growth mentality. She's not shy to share her faults and failures during lectures to ensure the students that they're not alone, and to destigmatize the openness of one's failures. She truly is an inspiration and I hope to leave an impact on someone the way she does on her students.","I find the question types to be incredibly helpful for studying, as well as the review notes, which have so far been crucial to getting good grades on quizzes and exams.","I would like it if we had more opportunity to work together.","I would have enjoyed going over the learning modules in lecture instead of it being self - taught","He moves fast but provides good material.","I would just say it's a typical intro. class. Nothing special but nothing bad either.","Dr. [Removed] is the nicest person ever","his lectures are informative but not super helpful for learning the material and making it stick but he does have a lot of questions to practice from","Our instructor has been nothing but nice and sweet to each individual student within the class. I would 100 percent retake this class because the class was very interesting and the instructor and student assistant was easy to work with and get along.","I appreciate how the instructor reminds us about other resources we can use to help our understanding of the material.","Not really. I like this class and am learning a lot.","Not much. Dr. [Removed] is a solid professor.","I think that is simply my professor's teaching style, and I have nothing against it. If time allows, I think he could squeeze in a few minute - long discussions to have with peers about our lecture so we can learn the material from a different perspective.","My professor made us get into groups and sit with them to foster a stronger sense of community. What I liked that she did was make a slideshow with a slide where we could put the answers for our groups whenever she asked the question a class, so we were able to show our answer and get feedback in a very low stakes environment.","She's good, just very monotone.","Professor [Removed] is a great lecturer, plus his labs are well - organized. The lab classes would be better if he is able to make time to help students in the lab sections ( whether it's in - person or virtually ).","Dr. [Removed] is very sweet and always makes me feel welcomed.","The instructor has given lots of helpful resources to prepare for exams.","I think Professor [Removed] does an excellent job with [Removed] [Removed] His lectures are generally interesting and are well connected to previous content covered. He seems to understand that not everyone will immediately grasp a concept ; during in class [Removed] quizzes, he drops hints to guide our thinking. With the example of [Removed] quizzes, my previous physics instructor ( [Removed] 303 K ) did not provide any guidance, and the quizzes were more heavily weighted on being correct, which ultimately led to confusion, the feeling that I wasn't learning, and even resenting some of the course content. \n\n Otherwise, Professor [Removed] is very approachable. I've asked a few questions myself and have been satisfied with his responses, and I've not seen him answer a question in a way that belittles or embarrasses a student. I feel that Professor [Removed] and the students both understand that [Removed] [Removed] can be rather difficult.","I appreciate that the instructor asks us what topics are “ muddiest ” or most unsure for students, then provides explanations for the topics. This was very helpful and aided in my studying fairly well.","I honestly love the postivie and encouraging environment that you have created for us. It feels like a safe space to learn and also to make mistakes.","My instructors have been very nice and helpful. [Removed] also plays music in the background while we work. Her music taste is a little generic but I'm not complaining.","I think due to the volume of information, not all topics can be covered in extreme depth. I think that while it's a bit unsatisfying, it's also a very astute choice because there is a schedule to adhere to and a curriculum to cover, so not all thing an be fully covered in depth because those individual concepts could take a whole other course to explain.","She is very comforting and makes the class seem less daunting. I tried to take intro to chemistry last year but I did not do well on my exams so I had to drop out of that class. This time, I am definitely understanding the material and doing better on exams.","I really like the unit review structure and the very clear expectations of what will be on the exam. In previous STEM courses, the review guides were overwhelming and vague, often not knowing what material I should prepare. In this course, the question types allow me to organize my studying and feel confident before exams.","Although some students greatly appreciated that she and other chem professors granted points back to students that missed arguably \" unfair questions \", I think that doing this puts students that went the extra mile at a disadvantage/ doesn't reward them for their efforts. I believe that all of the questions that received \" a regrade \" on my exam were fair and I was able to get them correct because of the information provided to me in the learning modules and exam preparation resources. While some of my fellow classmates received up to 16 points back on their assessments, I received nothing. Me and other students gain no compensation for getting a question right the first time around, and I think there should be a system for students that did not receive regrade points back to be able to receive some sort of credit back.","Dr [Removed] is an okay professor, I feel like the course is more self paced. There is little interaction or enthusiasm during lecture and very little encouragement of discussing the content with other students. Compared to other classes, like my [Removed] [Removed] class, I am more excited to learn because the content is taught in an engaging and important way. Most of the time the information presented in class is just read off slides and I could do that on my own.","I think the professor spends a lot of time on the easier topics and will blow over the more difficult parts. It can definitely be confusing to understand because she will often only teach the way she prefers but it is still a way to get it done. I also think the learning modules assigned are very, very long, it is content heavy which can make it hard to stay motivated. There are many TAs that walk around to answer questions. The professor also doesn't like for us to talk while she is lecturing, understandable but at the same time, it helps to talk with other students while we are being taught to fully grasp the content. In the end, it is just an introduction to [Removed] so it is going to be a larger class but I think there needs to be more understanding towards the student's side.","I dislike how she uploads different slides from the ones in the actual in - person lecture. In the modules on canvas, there are slides missing or that she does not show to us so it's hard for me to know how she got to a conclusion.","I like that her classes are one hour each because that makes it easier to keep up with content. I like the interactive nature of letting us work on problems ourselves before explaining them. I also really enjoyed the exit ticket she provided where she asked us to reflect on our goals while in college. It's nice when instructors seem to care beyond the scope of their class where our lives are headed.","I really like how she is open to talking about her past experiences and struggles in a male - dominated field and more generally about how she is very passionate about sense of belonging in the classroom","I like her grading policy and the way she reviews previous topics at the start of class as a refresher.","There are plenty of resources for this class that I appreciate greatly ( the \" [Removed] discussion \" tab on [Removed], plenty of office hours, access to prerequisite materials, and more ). My favorite of these resources is the exam preparation tab. I love the question types and the review notes based on them because I know what is expected of me and if I need more help in a certain subject.","I like the fact that she modifies the slide lectures and then publishes them with her annotations, which adds to another layer when I go through notes and visually see the work to get to the answer instead of a basic question - answer format.","I can not think of anything, but the enthusiasm of the instructor is a bit lackluster, and she seems very montone and not excited to teach.","I appreciate the study resources provided.","He just doesn't teach much and spends too much time on solving like one practice problem. Instead of just showing us how to solve it, he just does one little step and then gives like such a long pause trying to see if we could solve it, and by that time class is over and we've neither learned how to solve that problem or collaborated on it because no one else knows how to do it either. These long pauses and waiting for people to magically somehow figure out the answer is very irritating and does not help. He should just show us how to do the problems.","The professor is very quick to respond to student concerns and if the issue involves a large portion of the class she will take a few minutes at the beginning of class to mention the issue and resolve it if she has already found the solution. If she does not have an immediate solution, she keeps students updated until she has one.","No, she skips over some material and doesn't time manage lecture well sometimes and focuses on easier concepts then leaves us to figure out the harder concepts on our own.","It seems like she genuinely cares about her students and wants them to do well.","This class I have felt successful in because Dr. [Removed] presents students with many opportunities to succeed. She posts detailed learning modules for knowledge prior to the lectures and posts several resources for studying for exams.","this professor is great and in tune with students","I do sometimes feel a bit lost in the class by the way the professor teaches. I feel that the topics are not very clear and there's not a good explanation as to why something works the way it does. Chemistry right now is my hardest class because it is difficult to understand the unit. The questions the professor asks are overall confusing and do not much information as to how to approach the question. I would enjoy more explanation on certain topics.","professor [Removed] seems to really care about her students and encourages us to keep trying even when things feel hard, which is highly valued","She is an amazing lecturer and does a great job of making students feel accepted and ready to learn. She makes good jokes and keeps the mood light so that the heavier content days don't feel so bad.","Professor [Removed] really makes the class feel like safe space and it is so calming and helpful.","The teacher is very nice and appreciate that she gives us the resources to succeed.","Like i said this is a very fast paced class that needs a lot of self teaching","I think the instapoll questions he gives in class are very helpful in improving our learning experience. It makes the stuff he covers in class “ stick ” and keeps us engaged ( which is very important for a 1.5 hr lecture ).","She is very kind and approachable in class","She is very open and approachable.","Professor [Removed] is very thoughtful and kind. She shows a passion for teaching her subject and eases into topics to make learning a smooth process. I can see she is open to taking feedback and shifts her class towards what helps her students more.","I really like all of the resources the instructor gives us in this class, as it really enriches my understanding of concepts and prepares me for exams well.","I really like [Removed]'s method of teaching. The asynchronous modules plus the review of it in class is one of my favorite methods professors teach.","No he is great! \n","He does really well advertising his office hours. I've been wanting to attend but unfortunately I do have work and other classes that get in the way","Dr. [Removed] is very thoughtful and truly wants us to do well in her class. She's a great professor.","I liked how so was considerate to any piece of information that were not clear on the test","The TA is super kind and helpful. In case of any misunderstanding, she makes sure we are aware for the next submission. The TA also gives us heads up on what we can miss or what has been done or missed in the past. She goes over her thinking process on how she grades and looks for things.","I love the class a the instructor. i appreciate the amount of extra credit offered. I would ask for more practice questions or quizzes or more detailed reviews.","I really liked all the resources for exams that set us up for success. It helps knowing what's going to be on the exams and what we should be learning.","She is very friendly, and always smiling which makes you look forward to coming to the next class meeting.","Dr. [Removed] is very nice and will not discriminate anybody on their smarts ; she is a great teacher and doesn't shy away from any questions.","Overall I love the pace of the course and while I don't love writing, I like coming into class with an open mind ready to grasp whatever new concepts and perspectives lined up for me. This is also liley my most social class since I am given many opportunities to interact with my peers and discuss the material.","My professor was great. There is nothing in specific","I would ask that the professor allow for make - up exams for a better grade because grasping physics is different for everyone and the learning code is slow.","Professor [Removed] has been one of the best professors I've had so far. It is clear she cares about her students and the connections that she wants them to build. She gives us many opportunities to succeed, not wanting to let us fail / suffer from our mistakes. Rather, she allows us to make mistakes and grow / learn from them without fearing that we will lose points / get a lower grade. I love how she makes an effort to learn about her students and engage them in the material, as I think that helps the most with retention, as active participation in class helps information stick better. All in all, I wish I had a lot more professors like Professor [Removed], although I believe she is more capable to connect with her students than other professors due to the smaller size of her class.","I liked that the instructor is relatable and mentions mental health as being an important aspect of learning","The instructor often spends a lot of time on easier topics at the beginning of the lecture, with many practice questions and dicussion time among the students. However, this takes up a lot of class time and results in less time spend on more difficult topics at the end of the lecture. Oftentimes we barely cover topics in lecture before being quizzed on tested on it, and our class seems to always be behind of other professors in topics. I often have to learn topics at the end of the unit from other students to ensure I have a deep enough undertanding for the exams.","I really like how she structures the class with Instapolls and time to discuss with other students throughout the class. She's also very kind and understanding and it seems like she genuinely cares about our health and success.","I believe an exam drop would be better for the students than a retest. I say this because we have other exams to study for around the time we take these physics exams. Adding an exam on top of that seems stressful. Another thing I would say is to be more aware of the interactions the TA is having with the students.","No! I think [Removed] is super nice. I wish he did provide more materials that reflected the exams.","I wish that we were able to breakdown the practice problems in class because I feel like he jumps ahead and doesn't show how he gets there.","It was an open ended question for all so no one felt pressure to answer.","I have found his class to be one of the most enjoyable classes I attend. I really have liked him as a teacher so far.","No they are all very good.","I like Professor [Removed] a lot.","Not really just that she's a great instructor.","He's always very enthusiastic to talk about physics and genuinely listens to people's thoughts during lecture.","During the lectures, the professor reviews easier material longer than she reviews the more challenging content. But she does give plenty of practice problems to make sure we know the material.","She honestly is a good professor i just sometimes she would understand   that we are new to this environment and we don't always know what is happening.","I enjoy the instructor for ecology. I think she does a fine job at teaching a topic she is very involved in.","I like it went professors give opportunities for extra credit. I also like it went professors want you to learn and not punish you with a bad grade.","I love her teaching style, however I wish she would go in more detail during lecture instead of just skimming through it quickly","nothin else, Dr. [Removed] is doing a great job and the TA's are excellent at helping present information in a more digestible way when necessary.","The grading policy is not clear. You may lose points for some unexpected things.","I have understood from multiple people that she is pretty rude to students.","No I don't think so I enjoy the way the structure of the course is and I enjoy all the instructors that teach this course. I feel each and everyone fo them add somthing different to this course and what we learn and talk about.","Not at this time.","The instructor is awesome","She is a great professor, she cares about our learning. She makes sure everyone is caught up and is great at explaining.","Not really! I really enjoy Professor [Removed]'s class!","Her teaching style is fast paced but if you pay attention in her class she does a very well job at getting us all the information we need to be successful.","I don't have anything specific to say besides how helpful [Removed] is during lab. If you aren't sure about something you can always ask and she will clarify anything for you or give you her input.","She is very open about her experiences and struggles. She makes everyone feel welcomed and gives us a sense of belonging.","The lectures and the textbook information ( which we are told to study both ) are not consistent with each other! I am unsure of what will be on exams ; all the unclear information can be very overwhelming sometimes :( There is a lot of information, all from different places. Lectures tend to be all over the places sometimes. Dr. [Removed] is a very good teacher in the sense that he is very knowledgable, but sometimes I feel I am not actually getting the material because of the way he is teaching and it goes very fast and it does not align with his textbook sometimes.","N / A I believe my instructor is doing a wonderful job at interacting with students and teaching the material","Most of the topics previously mentioned do not refer to the lab setting of [Removed] Lab, in which the instructor mainly acts as a loose proctor within experiments rather than an actual lecturer or provider of information.","I would really like more short &amp; lt;5min breaks that offer icebreakers for us to talk to each other more, more specifically without any chemistry content involved.","It is just a very inclusive learning environment and whether I am in office hours or in class, he always answers the questions and makes sure I understand.","nope! But the class is mentally challenging","I would like a bit more review material. I asked some upperclassmen about additional review material,   and they told me that they had access to an \" orange textbook \" which had additional practice questions.","Dr. [Removed] connects [Removed] to the real world and shares his interests with us. He's shown fossils he's found and often shows pictures of interesting bugs from his garden. His passion for [Removed] is inspiring and contagious.","Love her asking for \" muddiest points. \" Hearing her say \" That doesn't make sense at all \" in response to a student's wrong answer on a lecture recording was a little discouraging.","She is a great teacher","Very helpful with helping us understand the big picture of why we are doing what we're doing.","The professor oftentimes asks us to talk to our peers around us about an unfamiliar concept to make sure we understand, however if you sit next to people who are equally as confused as you are then this is not beneficial, and she will oftentimes simply move on expecting that we all understand when that is usually not the case.","She is greattttttt!!","The professor has a cheerful personality that makes the course better.","que asking question to her it makes you feel as if you should already know the answer","No there is nothing else.","I did everything in this class that I was supposed to do before the exam. I had done all the textbook readings, re - did the homework problems three times, redid the practice exam twice, went to multiple office hours sessions, and reached out to other friends in the class. I had fully felt as though I understood the class content. However, after the exam I was disappointed with my grade despite the fact that I tried my best and the questions of the exam were significantly difficult, which we had not encountered in class or in the practice before.","Dr. [Removed] is very clear with what she expects from us but does not leaves us hanging. She always provide additional resources, such as muddiest points of the week review, practice exams, and study guides, to ensure we do our best in her course. To me, this is imperative for my success as I benefit a lot from studying resources provided directly from the professor. Dr. [Removed] has been nothing short of a wonderful professor.","Dr. [Removed] always makes everyone feel welcome. It feels nice to have this course since I can relax after a long day of lecture and not have to worry about any pressure from Dr. [Removed] or my peers.","My instructor has made sure to teach the curriculum in a way to help everyone understand. The amount of resources provided for exams and in general study is very helpful.","I think Dr. [Removed]'s class has a fair amount of course work, and the way he teaches make the material easy to understand.","Nothing in particular. I mostly am at school to learn whether the professor makes these acknowledgments or not does not influence that.","I like how she teaches structurally and the way she organizes her course page and material makes it easy to learn and absorb the information.","I overall like the internal structure of the course","I like environments where questions are accepted readily, as it improves the understanding of both the one asking and either corrects or reinforces the perception everyone else has on said material.","No there is not.","She is a very nice professor, and although she is sometimes very pushy about people participating during class ( I am too nervous to do so ), I appreciate her effort in having a more interactive class.","I really like how Professor [Removed] has organized this course. Since the exams are not high stakes, I feel less pressure to be perfect and am able to focus on understanding the material and appreciating it.","While working on handouts both the professor and teaching assistant will go around the class to help out one on one with things we are having difficulty with.","He likes the moon a lot. That has nothing to do with this, but I also like the moon a lot and its nice to know other people actually study and really enjoy the moon as well. I hope you're having a great day, if not go look at the moon. \n\n BUT TELL [Removed] TO BREAK DOWN HIS SIMPLIFICATIONS BECAUSE SOMETIMES HE JUST SIMPLIFIES EQUATIONS WITHOUT EXPLAINING HOW HE GOT [Removed] - TELL [Removed] \" WRITE OUT ALL THE [Removed] YOU DO FOR EVERYTHING EVEN IF ITS OBVIOUS \"","The instructor is very friendly, positive, personable, and understanding. Her courses focus on being able to apply data science and work through inevitable roadblocks. I enjoyed a past course so much that I chose to take her class for data science as well.","Dr. [Removed]'s positivity and openness makes her class very interesting and exciting, despite the difficulty of the material.","I LOVE [Removed] [Removed] \n","I do like professor [Removed]'s teaching style. It is more traditional in the way that you just come to class and take notes of what he writes on a blank piece of paper. He is very approachable which is great too. I do wish there were more resources on canvas available except for homework and a set of practice problems. As much as I practiced these I still did poorly on the exam and wish I could [Removed] had something else to study.","No, I don't have anything else to add. [Removed] is an amazing professor.","He is very consistent on his teaching method, which made me feel little more confident to adopt to college way of studying.","Professor [Removed] encourages members of the class who are reluctant to answer questions to open up, giving them their chance to shine, and teaching them that her class is a safe space to ask ( or answer ) questions. Whenever this happens, and a shy or closed - off student answers a problem correctly, it's very heartwarming.","I believe the instructor and the TAs try to make the course knowledgable and educational, yet enjoyable to the best of their abilities. They also try to help in any way which makes it easier to learn content and grasp practical skills.","No, but she is very welcoming and allows many opportunities for collaboration.","All content is extremely organized and student expectations are very clearly stated.","I really appreciate Dr. [Removed]'s efforts in explaining the material and pushing us to use our resources when studying.","The instructor isn't great at explaining all concepts and having to do majority independent work to get the material.","Dr. [Removed] has a good teaching style, the only negative part would be purchasing his textbook, but that is also part of his teaching format and therefore helpful regardless of its price.","This instructor is great! There are some cases where she wouldn't mention certain parts that I said \" No \" to but that's because it wasn't necessarily relevant. I also think that TAs are sometimes previous students who can provide recommendations about curriculum and coursework.","In my opinion, the quizzes with the [Removed] bank of questions are unnecessarily stressful... but that's my only concern!","She is a very excellent professor. I like all the resources she provides on her canvas page for the exams. I also like that we can retake up to two exams, which takes a lot of pressure off.","He kind of just jumps into problems with the assumption that we know most of the math concepts beforehand, which can sometimes leave me feeling a bit confused.","do a good job in making sure we understand the material even though we have a big class size.","She is a great teacher.","The instructor seems good. I like this course. The organization is great for [Removed], assignments, and [Removed], which is very important to me. The attendance policy is also lenient, which is also very important to me, as I do my best learning with homework / assignments as opposed to lectures.","Dr. [Removed]'s passion for statistics has rubbed off on me. I think her enthusiasm for what she's teaching makes learning the topics easier and relieves my stress. When I go to office hours, she explains my mistakes or questions in a very kind and thoughtful way.","I think he is a very understanding professor, it is nice to have someone who believes that all his students are capable of succeeding. I do think he has a lot of knowledge on topics which can make it harder to understand when asking him a question because it can often lead to more confusion.","I might be mistaken, but in the instructor's syllabus, it doesn't seem like he added information concerning mental health, but this does not mean that he does not support the aid thereof.","No, I feel he is a lovely man and a great professor.","This class is very well structured.","I really like Dr. [Removed]! He was made for teaching [Removed].","Its a very interactive class and much more manageable than [Removed] chem lab. Working with groups helps force you into working and getting to know other people.","I can tell how much effort has gone into setting up the curriculum for this class! And prof. [Removed] is so kind and patient :)","She is amazing and I think she does a great job making sure people are as prepared as possible. I do think she could give back credit where necessary when a student shows they are capable of knowing the material.","I think that it is a great resource that he uses prelectures and reviews them, but with the time they take up I think it can lead certain conversations to get brought up too much or become too surface level.","I think my instructor is doing her best to make sure there is a direct and clear path to success within her class. While it does require extra work, she provides us with the resources for success. The only thing I dislike is that certain class materials, like the learning modules, are not always provided with enough advance but are necessary for an understanding of the material within in - class learning. I also believe that the communication on when it is most useful to complete these by should be more clear. Sometimes it states they should be done by a certain time on the assignment but the due date is set to a later time and I believe this makes some confusion.","I think that [Removed] and [Removed] are both very good course instructors for this lab. They make the course fun, but they're both also very smart and organized, making nothing confusing and clearing up all misconceptions when they are asked. They're friendly people are good at their jobs, and this is my favorite lab course in [Removed] so far.","Dr. [Removed]'s use of [Removed] is honestly a mess and makes it incredibly difficult to stay organized. To begin, she posts student hours on the [Removed] calendar, so my calendar is cluttered with blocks for bio lab student hours instead of what I actually need. Other instructors use the calendar for assignment due dates, which is far more helpful, but Dr. [Removed]'s approach means I can't easily spot these deadlines that matter for my other classes. It's beyond frustrating, especially since there's no way to hide these events, making the calendar feel overwhelming and unusable. Student hours just need to be posted somewhere on the course's [Removed] page, like how all other instructors do it. On top of that, Dr. [Removed] floods our [Removed] inbox with messages that should just be posted on the course's announcement page. The inbox is for direct, important messages, not constant updates. Dr. [Removed] needs to understand how to use her [Removed] page efficiently and stop putting her course information in the most inconvenient and annoying ways possible.","I wish I would have known just how concept heavy the exams really are. I came into this course with zero physics knowledge and struggled very hard to udnerstand all the math concepts in the course. I worked for many hours with the tutors over at the [Removed] learning center and felt prepared to tacke the math questions on the exam but to my surprise most of the questions were conceptual and this really hurt my grade.","I feel that the questions from this survey do not accurately portray the expectations of a head TA in a [Removed] Lab.","I think it is very nice of [Removed]","I think Dr. [Removed] really cares about her students and their success in her class, and I think that I would love an opportunity to take her class again.","Very well organized and awesome proffessor","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor. I find that I have understanding of new material just as rich as understanding I have of material I was refreshed upon.","I think that she lectures too slow, she's not good at managing time we never get to go over all the material in lecture. However, I do feel like the resources and other aspects of the class make up for it and make it easy to succeed. That just would be my only compliant.","I wish she would spend more time fully explaining topics as if we have no prior experience, rather than just brushing over it slightly and teaching things as if we already know what we're doing. Even though we have learning modules, I learn better when I'm being taught in person.","Dr. [Removed] is a great instructor and pushes us to be the best we can be. I appreciate her teaching style and I am excited for the rest of the course. \n","The content can be extremely overwhelming and with little practice questions it can be a little difficult to get a good grade in the course.","Professor [Removed] does a very good job and covers a large amount of content very well. She speaks clearly and gives us everything to succeed as long as we do our part and use the material. I like the balance of lecture, interaction and talking among peers, and practice embedded into my time in her class.","I feel that the instructor could be more efficient in spending class time. We are always behind and this causes me to get confused often because the instructor starts to speed through all the other slides. We go through the material a little too fast and do not go in - depth on certain topics. This causes me to have to go through the lecture material after class and try to relearn it all.","She asks after every topic if everyone understands what she is saying but because there are so many people in the class, your opinion doesn't really matter but that is not the instructor's fault, more it is just because general chem is a large class always.","I liked how she gives examples on each thing as we are going through lecture.","I think the instructor's positive attitude and just overall joy for what they do makes you want to show up to class everyday.","I just very much appreciate how available / active Dr. [Removed] is on [Removed] to help us outside of class time. Physics can be a scary subject to learn, and I feel very supported in his class.","Performed experiments in the beginning of the course helped me and other students pay attention to the topic at hand.","She made the lab very homey because the ta's and her interact with us a lot and are very kind \n","Dr. [Removed] is a very caring person that genuinely hopes to see you succeed. I also believe the smaller class size lends to a greater sense of community in the class, letting me feel like I truly fit in.","I think the instructor should work a little harder at making class interesting with real - world examples that reference pop culture if she is able to.","Dr. [Removed] has made genetics way more easier. It is a hard course because of the material but her personality and passion for genetics really motivates me. Her teaching methods are great and she's a very encouraging woman. Can't wait to see how the rest of the semester goes!","I like the assignments Dr. [Removed] gives us in class. I find them very helpful to make sure that I understand the material and see what I have to study later.","I just feel like she goes to fast through her lectures.","She is very interested in the study of genetics and genuinely wants to create connections with each student, especially through memorizing names.","She is great at giving us resources to succeed, but I do feel like most lectures we are unable to get through the material for the day.","He gave a very comprehensive review of basic physics principals to start off the first few days of class.","Dr. [Removed] is an amazing teacher for intro chem, coming into college I was nervous about taking chem after hearing the horror stories, but Dr. [Removed] has broken it down for me and has provided a great experience. She ensures all her students are engaged and that we are putting ourselves in the best position to succeed by taking advantage of our resources.","Even though the class they teach is a topic that is very challenging for me and something I dreaded having to take in college, the professor has made the class feel welcoming and supportive. I would not be afraid to approach them to ask questions or provide feedback.","I think sometimes she's just reading off of the slides and marking things that aren't necessary. Before our test, she had two lectures where she mainly went over electron configuration, which I personally do not find to be that difficult of a topic, and felt as though the time could be allotted to things much more difficult.","She has be the only professor I have had so far that acknowledges the mental struggles that students in stem majors face. Telling us constanly that it is ok to cry, and to feel like you aren't good enough, and to have imposter syndrome. she tells us that we are not alone and that these feelings are common, but she also motivates us with her success stories as a female physist.","He's a great lecturer! Definitely seems to enjoy the job.","I do remember her throughout last week, explain that there are different accommodations for rigorous classes that we have available to us, for example, chemistry. I also remember that she mentioned the different out of class resources available to us as tutoring.","Not at the moment","The instructor is really good overall, but sometimes it can be hard to fully understand the material when we spend a lot of time discussing with our peers because no one really knows what's going on. Maybe less practice questions and more focus on learning the foundational stuff.","She is a great professor but when asking more advanced conceptual questions and multiple students answering the answer can get muddled when too many solutions are put out there.","No there isn't anything else I would like to share.","I feel comfortable going to this professor if I am struggling and need help.","[Removed] she lit.","She's always talking about whispering. Like we are in a giant lecture hall you can't expect to hear a pen drop. Honestly, sometimes I don't even here these whispers. I'm not saying it's an auditory hallucination, but maybe there's a disconnect in what's being heard and understanding of what it is.","There is nothing much else to share! I just need to study a lot.","He has been a good instructor, and I really enjoy this course!","nope, he's a good professor","No, I just think he teaches differently than my learning style","I really appreciate the structure of the course and how it is centered around practicing during class and the support we get outside of class. I like to learn by doing and I feel like this class allows me to do so.","Thank you for being so open to improvement and really care about your students! I really appreciate it and that's the kind of teacher I want to be.","The instructor was very willing to answer questions - even on the smallest parts of lab. She is very helpful and is always walking around the classroom.","Dr. [Removed] is a phenomenal instructor and really wants us to understand genetics and why things happen rather than just memorizing definitions and ratios. She loves when students ask questions which is great but I'm just an extremely shy person, so I typically don't.","The instructor is helpful with recommending and supplying resources for students to use. Take initiative over your studies and you'll be fine.","She is the best, allows people to redeem themselves","The instructor goes through questions students have throughout lectures and at the end when they are posted on square caps, which i found helpful and interactive.","N / A I love her!","She encourages us to come to office hours and to rely on our peers, TA's and other resources when we are stuck on a problem, teaching us that even the brightest mind will need help eventually.","Love being able to discuss class content with my peers as this gives me an opportunity to learn from others","I am very happy and excited about the way this course is structured! Thank you!","She is just such a friendly and inspiring person and professor, I was scared to take this class but I have been doing amazing in this class and i have been LOVING physics because of her!!! I love the traditional lecture style and passionate teaching with the quiz questions to test our knowledge.","I think Dr. [Removed] does a great job of explaining things in a way that feels approachable in class. He also makes use of the time to encourage us to discuss possible answers and come to our own conclusions.","The entire layout of the course is incredibly helpful for someone who is barely transitioning into the rigor of college courses. The [Removed], availability of [Removed] / office hours, quizzes, review notes, etc. is a perfect way to set students up for success. Having such a thought - out and established course has definitely helped me.","I'd like her to not be playing music in class while she's actively instructing all of us, it makes it kinda hard to follow what she's saying at times.","I would reccomend making the grading policy a little less harsh. The minimum grade for an A is a 94 while most other professors make it a 93.","I appreciate that the instructor makes an effort to discuss with students during lectures ( through lecture handouts to be done in groups ), rather than simply talking / lecturing at us.","There is nothing notable that I can think of at this time.","I feel that Dr. [Removed] is very concerned with student needs and attempts to provide all students the chance to reach mastery. However, in a 300 person lecture class, it can be difficult to meet students at a diverse set of backgrounds and hear all their difficulties. While I do feel that the teaching assistants alleviate this burden, I still feel that, for those struggling, the overall size and organization of the class can make the experience frustrating.","The test was very challenging overall. Many student failed","It was sort of jarring to have a professor admit to getting a D in the very class he was teaching to his students. He used that as a way to tell us to just \" do better than him \", which is to say he told us to not be depressed and find better study methods. On one hand, it was sort of encouraging but at the same time it sort of comes off as \" I went through worse so you people better get your stuff together and do better \". It can come off as either encouraging or condescending.","No, honestly our TA is very kind and wants us all to succeed. She is very approachable and extremely thorough with her instructions / expectations.","No my instructor is quite adequate and does a good job of passing out material to study","I really like the instructor, but outside of her lectures, it does not feel as though there are enough opportunities to learn the content or supplement knowledge","I don't like how [Removed] is constantly reviewing content rather than teaching at times. Also, during the week of exams, he is teaching new content while students are focusing more on exams which means a lack of learning. The grading curve could also be improved a lot of the time.","I wish Dr. [Removed] would take handwritten notes with us over the concepts instead of just going over slideshows during class. He is an amazing professor, but I want a more interactive way to understand the material.","Professor [Removed] is extremely supportive and encouraging towards students regarding exams and quizzes. She constantly reassures us of our abilities and understanding which leads towards less stress and more confidence when taking these assessments.","She is a great instructor! She is very encouraging, engaging, and supportive.","As a member of the dyslexic community vocationally I can not understand a word he is saying","I like how Professor [Removed] allows us to learn from our mistakes. This helps foster an inclusive and safe learning environment.","She is always very kind and happy to answer any questions I am curious about and it makes ecology fun to learn.","I really like that there is an option to not have to ask questions out loud but rather through ed discussion, which makes it easier for me","No, there isn't anything else I would like to share.","I like that he encourages us to work with people near us when answering questions during lecture/","Sometimes the professor doesn't time the lectures appropriately, so we end up behind. This means we have to speed through some of the lecture slides faster than I would like. While the content isn't difficult to review on my own, it can be frustrating when we fall behind.","Nope! I really appreciate Dr. [Removed] and all that he contributes to his class.","My instructor is constantly trying to improve the environment in which she teaches in, as I specifically notice that she wants to keep talking at a minimum throughout lecture. This helps students stay on track overall throughout lecture periods.","Dr. [Removed] is a very good professor and a sweet person. However, how she explains things sometimes feels chaotic and leaves students more confused than they were beforehand.","I really enjoy the class and think everything is set perfect. I do have one critique though. I believe the discussion sections - outside of taking quizzes - are kind of a waste of time at the moment. When asked about homework, from what I've noticed, not much work is done, and people mostly only show up for the quizzes or sometimes the extra credit opportunities. To benefit students, something that my [Removed] class actually does is during [Removed], we are given a handout - practice problems - that we first do as a class ( independently or in pairs ) and then discuss as a whole - with the TA. This gives some more practice and I feel as if its better than just opening it for HW in general, as I feel like we have enough TA's and drop - in hours that going over HW during Discussion [Removed] is quite unecessary.","The instructor typically encourages us in class to work in groups which is nice because it fosters a communicative work environment.","Nothing else to share.","I absolutely love how supportive the teaching team is, and how even outside of class they are so supportive. They send us weekly affirmations and tell us to take care of ourselves. The connection the teaching team makes to the students is far beyond what I've seen other teams do ; Dr. [Removed]'s team excels at it.","This is a [Removed] course ; I see no issue with this. We're here to learn [Removed] and that's what our Professor teaches us","We have done readings and had assignments about experts in this course, the instructor just never went into detail about any of these people.","No just please better explanation and more explanation on conceptual questions on the test","Our instructor is calm, collected, and organized and teaches the material in a way that is easy to grasp highlighting the important parts that we need to focus on more and what we should do to be successful in the course.","The professor is very straightforward in lectures and explains topics to a good amount, though she can be a little too fast - paced for the students taking notes. She is very nice and open to answering questions and I really like her attitude in class.","I like the overall structure of the course, having the same format of assignments, but building upon them every week in preparation of our final research poster presentation!","She's a great teacher!","The first week could've been slowed done a little it went kind of fast for new material, but since then we have moved at a good pace.","The course lectures are very fast and much of the class is left confused or unclear because the rate is faster than people can formulate questions or understand what they don't understand to the degree of being able to articulate a question. This leaves many people needing outside help and committing additional time and energy to learn from things that were not clear in lecture and there was no time to ask about because the professor moves too quickly usually from material subjects. Not everytime but certainly often enough to leave many confused.","The lectures are an hour and fifteen minutes long, and every class the professor gives a two or three minute break in the middle to relax, chat, and have a snack. I really appreciate the break as it makes the classes feel shorter and less intense and demonstrates, in my opinion, a real care and concern for her students' well - being. She is also generally very friendly and open, joking around and sharing things she personally finds fun and interesting, which makes her feel more like a person you can interact with more freely rather than just an authority figure.","I like that most lectures she starts with announcements and talks about her journey with her sense of belonging during her college years, as I find it very relatable and not alone.","Dr. [Removed] is a very well rounded professor.","he's just awesome","[Removed] is definitely the best of the best! I really enjoy the seminars! They are super informative! Those life skills are definitely going to be valuable! It'll come in handy!","During the in class activities Dr. [Removed] would go into the rows and assist students that need help, which is nice.","I like that Dr. [Removed] starts class by asking how we are or allowing us to spend a couple minutes talking about our peers about our weekend. It lightens the mood and gets us ready to start learning content.","The resources he provides us with before exams are helpful. He tells us what concepts we need to know.","I really like how Dr. [Removed] has different options for the last 5 % of our grade. We can choose to either go to Discussion [Removed], watch and answer questions for [Removed] videos, or do the [Removed] reading assignments. This is very helpful because although I chose the Discussion [Removed] option, I also like to watch the [Removed] videos occasionally when I want to strengthen my understanding on the concept.","Loveridge is a chill guy, would recommend to my friends for PHY303 K","She really loves to respond to [Removed] discussion questions about course content very thoughtfully. All her posts have some sort of extra material whether it be a picture or links to related resources, which is above and beyond.","No, not necessarily.","The class is just very large and virtually impossible to know everyone on a personal or even name basis, but this is definitely made up for by the TA's in the discussion section. If you have a good TA you are more likely to be better prepared when the exams come around.","He would often talk students through common misconceptions in interpreting how physics works and this has been exceptionally important to me. I'm not someone who understands physics well and having someone talk to me explaining why I have misconceptions about a concept and why the correct method is correct has been extremely useful.","Dr. [Removed]'s class is huge so I don't have the chance to get to know her personally but I know she is very cool and fun anyway. I really like how organized this course is despite the class size which I why I think Dr. [Removed] is a great instructor.","I would like for them to be more engaging with the students and have more practice problems throughout.","Review on the day of exam was really helpful.","I respect [Removed]'s passion for creating a freshman - friendly course by providing many resources and even looking at tests on a case - by - case basis to get a look at the most accurate grading process in a class of over a hundred students.","Recently, class has been interrupted because of the professor telling people to stop whispering but in all honesty, I never hear any whispering. Most of the background sounds in the lecture hall are made up of coughs and creaks not whispering in my opinion. The constant stopping of class to address this issue that most students don't notice distracts me and causes me to lose focus.","He is very open and receptive in class. Very kind, which creates a comfortable environment.","She's a little monotone, but teaches well. I appreciate the resources she gives us to study.","I enjoy that he is so relatable! He doesn't want anyone to be nervous or embarrassed.","I've enjoyed this course so far, because prof. [Removed] makes the lectures interesting. I especially like that the lectures and instapolls really emphasize core concepts.","I think that the course so far provides all the materials I need to be successful in it. I think it could be improved with smaller handouts that are more specific to only the concepts and with maybe one or two exercises. I like looking at the handouts after class, and I think this would make it easier to follow.","I like Dr. [Removed] but I feel like sometimes his lectures don't really prepare us well for the questions he asks at the end of class. Even after doing the reading I have difficulty answering all the questions within the 10 or so minutes provided, especially since many of the questions involve interpreting graphs / reading paragraphs.","I would appreciate more practice problems and enhanced lecture slides that include annotated notes, which could significantly improve the learning experience. The current slides are somewhat basic and lack detailed explanations that could help clarify complex topics. Additionally, having access to a broader range of practice problems would allow for better preparation for exams and deeper understanding of the course material. This would not only aid in retention but also boost confidence in applying the concepts taught.","I greatly appreciate the amount that the professor offers extra credit opportunities to students.","Dr. [Removed] is extremely kind and caring. She makes sure we all get rest, are in a good mental state, and ready to learn.","As a student who has difficulty concentrating on reading textbooks for long period of time due to [Removed], I really appreciate the diverse amount of resources that Professor [Removed] and her TAs put out such as the handouts and lecture slides. One slight change I might recommend is to have more visual resources such as helpful videos or diagrams that show how each concept relate to each other, but this is a minor concern since there are still many resources available for visual / auditory learners such as CSS and discussions. I also really appreciate the practice quizzes that Professor [Removed] puts out, since it helps me feel prepared for the quiz and motivated in the course, which is a big help for my perfectionism and anxiety over academia, especially since I have previously failed a biology course due to this.","Even though I overlooked the focus on learning objectives at first, when it came time to studying for the test, this was a very useful criteria to look for in my exam preparation and helped me adequately realize what concepts I needed to spend more time with.","My instructor has offered a lot of materials for preparing for exams which is very helpful.","She is a good professor considering the large lecture hall. I wish she'd teach faster and actually get through all the material.","She is very patient and kind! \n","She is very nice and approachable, but the lectures are sometimes rushed and vague.","Dr. [Removed] is awesome","My TA is really great and does a great job with what she can control. I know a lot of the course layout is not up to her, but the professor. I know that my TA cares about us doing well and learning. She also values our time, while also making sure we have a strong understanding of the experiments.","Dr. [Removed] always emphasizes putting our health and well - being first in order to do better in other aspects of life. I really appreciate how she does that because it makes me feel seen and makes me feel like my teacher cares about us.","Not at this time.","I appreciate his flexibility and kindness","She is a very caring and engaging professor that I am lucky to have.","No, other than mentioning the feedback surveys for extra credit, she rarely talks about anything other than the lecture material and her own experience in the field of chemistry.","I would love to be able to take actual notes during class because I do not understand anything we are doing or any of the content, and I would like to have actual notes to look at for the class.","Dr. [Removed] is great! She's honestly very motivating, supportive, empathetic, and truly wants her students to succeed. I only wish she explained her lectures in more detail. Because of COVID-19, not all students have the strongest background in chemistry. It kind of feels like she just skims the slides during the lecture, so I find myself having to do a lot of self - teaching.","I enjoy the leaning modules alongside the retries you get as it gives you an opportunity to learn. I also like the reviews that were provided ; however, I think it would be efficient to maybe have a website that auto generates questions to make endless reviews so it's impossible to run out of resources.","I think I was just nervous for exam one and that the concepts were pretty fair considering what we were supposed to know.","Having discussion sessions in the evening is quite taxing in my opinion and I would prefer a discussion during the day but it seems for many physics and math related classes at this university, they are all in the evening which is fine for people who live on or near campus but as a commuter it is quite the extra effort to add to my commute at the end of the day.","I think more guidance in taking notes in this class, and more structure on what is required to know and what is not required, that distinction will save a lot of students time and energy.","This js a very textbook heavy class and you definitely have to study and put in the work and if you do you should be good","I think I added everything in the previous answers.","Professor [Removed] is definitely an excellent educator, and it is clear that he is passionate about the material he teaches. My only complaint with the course is that the homework assignments often do not match the material learned in class, and more classtime could be dedicated to preparing for and understanding the homework.","The class is challanging but I truely in joy it","The questions on the weekly quizzes are worded really confusingly.","I think she's great","Dr. [Removed] is a very solid professor and she makes a really good effort that proves well","Not much besides the fact that she shows she cares and I really appreciate that!","I really like Dr. [Removed], he's very nice.","The instructor has us collaborate with other students during class, and I find this helpful.","She's a good professor who helped me understand the course material.","I feel comfortable bringing up questions / concerns I have with her. I appreciate that it feels like a casual interaction with no judgement.","I feel like if you had a background in physics already, this class would be easier to follow.","I think the true / false question are a really good test of knowledge. I have never had true / false questions on a test, so they were a surprise for me at first. However, they really force you to conceptually understand what you are working with as opposed to just numbers into equations.","He is a good professor, very thorough in lecture.","The instructor is really nice and she is always offering opportunities to help your grade and do well on your assignments.","Sawyer is just a really great personality and brings a sort of comfort to the lab setting, doesn't feel like she is talking down to us or is better than us in any way, and this makes for a more inclusive learning environment.","The instructor provides good extra credit opportunities and overall makes it easy to do well in the class.","As a future educator myself, it was very impressive that the day after the exam she changed how she taught us in class. You could tell she wasn't super happy with our test scores and resorted to giving us more hands on work to hopefully enhance our learned. Do I think I will end up with an A in this class? Probably not, but I have already learned so much and appreciate Professor [Removed]' efforts to keep us on track as a class!","The instructor teaches a class with 500 people in it, the focus of lectures are content which is fine and I like better.","I think the instructor is fair and cares about students' understanding of the material. I would recommend this course to others.","Overall, Dr. [Removed] is a great teacher! I like how she encourages collaboration instead of competition. This way, students don't feel anxious when asking questions. I also like how the teams can help us explain concepts to each other.","Dr. [Removed] is a caring and thorough teacher. Even though, she rushed a little to complete the material prior to the exam, the [Removed] Discussion, review notes, and practice exams are great study resources and reflect what to expect on the exam. Her slides in class are also great!","The professor feels very distant to students. TA's lead most or all outside of lecture activities. I don't know how to connect to her.","I love Professor [Removed], as she's a great person and very knowledgeable, but she sometimes teaches very fast and doesn't account for students to not fully grasp a topic. Even if a few students understand a topic she moves on.","Post the lecture slides before the class on Wednesday so we are able to a study before the quiz.","The professor reviews important topics, and puts links to slides and information in the canvas for those who want extra studying but don't have time during the day for tutoring or office hours.","He is a great teacher","No, I wish he provided practice exams to help us prepare for future tests.","I like Dr. [Removed], but it is hard to connect with her one on one due to the size of the class. That is out of her control, though, so it is not a big complaint.","No. I need to study more and go to office hours","I believe the instructor is stated at the beginning that this was the first year teaching thermodynamics ( I might be making this up ) so some of the questions were hard to answer or not possible considering this fact.","I appreciate how my instructor always has a calm voice. He doesn't seem strict, instead seems approachable. I really like how he teaches ; however, I would just like to see more practice problems in [Removed] to practice for the exam.","Dr. [Removed] make the classroom experience great!","She tends to skip through material since she doesn't explain it fast enough.","I believe Dr. [Removed] truly does care about his students and their learning experiences which I do feel whenever I go to his lectures.","I enjoy the amount of resources Professor [Removed] has provided the students. In order to study and prepare for exams, there are a plethora of assignments and documents on canvas that can assist in learning and understanding the material.","She is extremely caring and encourages me to learn. I feel she is very approachable, and that makes for a much better learning environment than if she weren't. She clearly explains concepts and checks for understanding. She is patient and kind and fosters a very healthy, inclusive, supportive learning setting.","Our instructor is very calming and clear in presenting course material. She breaks facets of the class down in a clear way and leaves room for not only lecture but also problem solving in the classroom.","She expects every student to know what she knows, so rather than actually teaching us, she skims over everything because she just assumes we have the same knowledge as her. I have learned 99 % of the class entirely on my own.","He is very nice and open to people asking him questions.","She's always been very supportive throughout the course and has provided even some practice from another professor who has also taught this course Mrs. [Removed], overall she's been great support and provided me with a push to continue working hard on all of my classes.","I always feel great and relaxed when an instructor reminds me that I can always get in contact with them for help because I don't feel as overwhelmed by the course.","i love how an 88 is an A-. that makes me excited to actually put in the effort and try for this class because an 88 is more doable than 90","Dr. [Removed] is an excellent instructor very understanding and workable. He does tend to speed up his content, but if you keep up with the reading, than you should be overall fine.","The current layout works wonderfully and helps to not put much stress on one's workload. It does extremely help that the deadlines are set for 11:59 PM or an hour before class and that quizzes are based on pre - labs so as to not overexert us.","Dr. [Removed] takes a personal interest in each and every one of her students. She is very good about ensuring that no one is left behind and that everyone has equal opportunity to benefit from her class.","Dr. [Removed] is a very positive person who is great at breaking down problems to a more manageable bite. Additionally, his emphasis on an open mindset helps support students through the hard parts of the course.","Overall, while the learning modules are helpful, I do wish most of the material was taught in lectures.","Honestly, I really like Dr. [Removed] and I would recommend anyone to take him. I came into his class with absolutely no prior knowledge and this class has so far still set me up for success. He is also extremely understanding which is so nice to have in a professor.","Not particularly. It's a great class but I'm not sure if that's due to her being an amazing teacher or simply because of how the course is structured ( not sure how much control she has over that I suppose ). Either way, I am very happy with this course and would recommend to anyone who needs a science course ( if not already a requirement for their major ).","Dr. [Removed] is a funny and engaging lecturer, but the material we cover and quest practice is not sufficient to succeed at the level I am used to, even though I prepared thoroughly with the lecture notes and homework problems.","He is great, honestly. Very respectful and knowledgeable","he is really cool, i like his demos and he has a sense of humor that a lot of professors lack nowadays. He does goes very fast but his instapolls help a bit to understand the materials","nah i hate this class","Really like how Professor [Removed] gives us lots of example problems and helps us solve them in class. I also like how her class is very consistent and she tells us what to expect for the upcoming week through her announcements.","Typically, we have pair and shares for a plethora of questions throughout the lecture, and we have \" Instapolls \", where we share and answer question provided in a survey.","I wish there was more resources other than square caps and [Removed]'s","Caudill does touch base after each subject, but she kind of just reads off the slides, and then rushes at the end of the lecture. I guess its just the pacing of the lectures, but most times the learning modules kind of teach most of the material, so a little touch base and then moving on top the new material would be more helpful, in my opinion.","I find Dr. [Removed] personable and encouraging. I leave the class with a better understanding of the material thanks to her clarity and the class structure. I benefit from the flow of learning modules, in - class lectures, and instapolls / quizzes.","Dr. [Removed] is very passionate about the course he teaches and very charismatic in teaching that course. I appreciate how he includes examples of the moon landings and astronauts it keeps the class interesting and you can see he really enjoys what he teaches. He is also quite considerate of all his students despite having such a large class so I think having him as a professor will definitely change my perspective on physics for the better!","I enjoyed when they would bring us snacks / candy to eat during class as it just put me in a better mood for class that day.","Dr. [Removed] can be hard to hear at some times so students usually crowd the front of the room. The slides also go fast so studying beforehand is a must. There is a lot of extra credit, however, which I appreciate.","Dr. [Removed] is really helpful with office hours and making sure students get the help we may need.","I appreciate his straight - forward approach to problem - solving, he also seems to genuinely support students and respect their feedback","There is not anything else that I can think of that I'd like to share.","Love her, she is very nice","Instructor is very encouraging and likes to make sure we are engaged during the lectures","Enjoys what he does and it has a positive impact on the learning environment","My instructor is very nice and always approaches any problem that we encounter positively. Even if some groups didn't get good bacteria that are antibiotic resistant or antibiotic producing, the instructor would explain that these results are still important. There might be other [Removed] pathogens that might have a different result, so it is still important to have that information.","Dr. [Removed] clearly cares about his students and is passionate in our learning. You can tell that he will do anything and provide whatever resources necessary if he believes they will help us learn and succeed in his class. I do wish that lectures were a little more clear in explaining the content, and that we were given a little more time to answer the sqarecap polls so we could more deeply understand the questions. The TAs in this class are very attentive and want to help us understand concepts. Overall a good learning environment but a little fast paced.","No, so far, the instructor is doing quite well in getting the material across and it's helpful","Often times there is little room or time for questions as the instructor often brushes past all the subjects fast. this leaves students confused and their questions unanswered.","My only other idea to add is that Dr. [Removed] often seems to speed through all of his lectures without thoroughly explaining the significance of each concept or way to be able to learn the content effectively. He often tells us to \" understand \" a complicated concept wothout actually going into detail about what it is we need to know about it.","I think this class if very interesting and thorough, but sometimes there is too much work that doesn't seem necessary. For example, some of the research reports and prelabs I think take up too much time and have us spend that time on something that isn't as important or useful to what we're doing. It's also a lot of work for a 2 credit course.","She's a good instructor and she teaches well slights room for improvement","Everything has been super helpful, esp in class demos and the hw being due every week helps solidify the knowledge \n\n\n","The class is sufficient, more collaboration and more examples during class would help with understanding the topics.","He's a nice professor and man but it is important to put your own outside work","Na, I really enjoy Dr. [Removed]'s class","I really like how the professor reinforces our learning by referring back to previous material and making us practice it in new circumstances. Usually, she quickly goes over topics and then we see them in practice through the worksheet, lab, and homework. Although this can be a lot of work, I think it really helps me learn. I feel encouraged when I get to have multiple attempts to learn the material. Also, I like it how she discusses that it's totally normal not to feel comfortable with coding and stuff. When she does this, I feel like I'm making good progress and that I'm not behind.","I like how nice he is. It makes the class less intimidating and have a more positive vibe.","Dr. [Removed] is doing a wonderful job as a professor! I was intimidated to take physics in the beginning, but he makes it very approachable through engaging lectures and collaboration.","She is great. Very smart and a great explainer, provides us with the materials we need to do well and is a very kind and genuine lady.","Some of the material feels rushed, it makes me feel anxious and feels like I need to rush through the information to be able to keep up with what is going on in class.","Dr. [Removed] is very caring and understanding when it comes to mishaps with an exam, sickness, technological troubles, and any issues we may face that prevent us from learning. These actions and empathy towards situations helps to create a more fulfilling learning environment that is not constantly pressurized by the need to succeed, but rather by fostering the growth of the individual student.","She is very open to comments students make during class and remind us that we can feel free to share our thoughts. Even if our guess on a question is wrong she reminds us that it is a learning environment and no one will judge.","He is a very good professor, but I feel like sometimes he goes a little to fast. I know there is a lot of concepts to cover, but sometimes he goes through the topics too quick and doesn't give time to process what he has written.","She is very kind and calming, and I can tell she truly cares about her students.","Throughout [Removed] School, [Removed] was something I struggled with. Going into [Removed] now, I was very nervous. However, Dr. [Removed]'s is an incredible professor, and she has helped me understand [Removed] on a level I previously deemed impossible.","The change in lab style which includes quizzes that are graded in a tough manner all just for 3 points has caused so much stress. It feels very unfair because last semester students didn't have to do this. The weekly assignments, the [Removed] assignments to be exact, take up way too much time and are also unfair because to receive full credit we have to be reading and writing for about 35 minutes, take part in discussion ( which is fair ), and also give and receive upvotes. There are so many students in one assignments so there are chances our comments aren't seen by everyone because of the amount of comments and we might end up not receiving upvotes. If that happens, that is points off. The TA is also pretty strict it doesn't feel like a learning experience at all it feels as if we're being monitored and a single mistake will cause her to get mad at us and treat us like little kids who aren't doing things correctly. I came into this lab with a positive attitude and with the idea that I will get to earn my bio lab credit in a fun way while learning new things. Instead, I am left with so much unnecessary stress. Overall, I'm having a pretty stressful experience.","Not really, [ retty standard teaching stile. Is very engaging and supportive.","My instructor is great, she provides a lot of information and source for us to do good in this course. \n","The instructor is kind and inclusive but I feel like I mainly get help from office hours or peers when I'm having trouble understanding the material","I am satisfied with my professor.","I love the fact that we get groups for class to discuss assignments. They're very helpful when answering questions.","The instructor is good at teaching just talks too fast and doesn't provide as much detail in lectures. Lectures like already know the concept.","He is a good professor he gives all the resources needed it is up to you to learn how to use the resources and be able to apply them to tests.","Dr. [Removed] is a great teacher. I wished she talked faster.","The instructor always has practice questions given to us after discussing a concept. He always encourages us to discuss with our classmates about any questions we may have. He then goes over the questions and gives time for any additional questions we may have.","The instructor has been very willing to help. She is great about checking in with students, keeping the pace of the class reasonable and providing students with valuable opportunities to learn and demonstrate their knowledge.","Sometimes it gets hard to follow her during lectures because she would explain a concept and suddenly bring in a different topic that we would learn about the next lecture day ; however, it's nice for her to give us a sneak peek of the next day's topic, it's just that because of the fast - paced nature of this class and the amount of new material we have to learn, it gets difficult to follow. \n\n Regardless of that, I like how she teaches the course material and I also greatly appreciate the practice problems that she does on the board since it makes it easier to understand the concept. Additionally, it's nice how she brings in material from past units to show how everything relates to one another.","He always comes to class with a smile and we really appreciate it. Sometimes, life gets hard, and I know he goes home a different person, but when he's in class, he's all smiles.","Mrs. Hall recommended that we look at a [Removed] extension that would help with deadlines and reminders which speaks to what she has learned from having a daughter in college.","I think one of the most beneficial things that the professor does for us is that she makes a list of the question types that will be on the exams. This gives us a clear, cut - out overview of what to expect and tells us exactly how to study which helps maximize my time and what the most important concepts are to review.","Dr. [Removed] is a very good professor and really cares about the course and the students. I love how she wants to keep improving the course and give students the best experience possible.","I appreciate the instructor's ability to balance lectures and student collaboration into class. I also think that the lectures are engaging.","I love my instructor he provides lots of info that we need that is going to be on the test","The instructor is good over I have no complaints, I like the teaching style and the way the instructor handles class as a whole.","No I think I said everything, she's a great professor and really knows how to teach difficult topics in a manner that's easily interpreted.","She s a good professor, she s nice.","The instructor is a very good one and I like how there is so much material that is given to us for us to use.","I appreciate that when students argued for their point about a test question he listened and understood them and then removed that test question. This made the students feel like they are listened to.","We barely get any time to discuss topics among classmates in class and not a lot of time is spent going into depth on the materials. The class feels fast - paced. In order to properly prepare for class and learn the topics, I have to consult outside materials. Only then, am I able to see / understand the steps that go into solving a problem.","The instructor is very good and teaches the material very well.","no. She s been very great!!","There is way too much unnecessary work. This lab takes up more time than some of my engineering courses just because of the random assignments that I don't believe have even impacted me or taught me anything.","There is not much student - professor interaction going on in the classroom. Professor does not ask if there are any questions and I can't remember the last time a student talked in class.","No, nothing specific","Dr. [Removed] also tries to learn faces and names and really intract with her students as much as she can. She is very helpful in office hours and incredibly dedicated to what she does, which I appreciate a lot. Dr. [Removed] is approachable as well, and if I had circumstances that hurt my performance in the class or I needed additional help, I would be more than willing to speak with her.","Dr. [Removed] is super interactive and a great professor! She makes a very hard class enjoyable and even when times are tough, I know she believes that I can succeed!","no there is not","I would like him to improve on his teaching during the lectures, focusing on explaining the material as if it is new rather than reviewing it like we already know the information.","They don't immediately test after they finish a unit's material ; they wait about a week, making it much easier to study and score well on the next test.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor!","The way he carries the class being able to joke with us but also keep it serious when needed. I also really like the ice breakers and activities we do to get the students active and get to know one another.","I enjoy this class! It is highly fast paced and takes 8 - 10 hours of outside work for me, but the topics are interesting and I enjoy struggling a bit.","She is encouraging and ensures that we know she truly cares for our success.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor and she makes this course very interesting even though it is a challenging course.","Dr. [Removed] is not just a knowledgeable professor in physics but also very interactive and humorous with his students. I believe this is an extremely important quality that fosters learning more than one would imagine.","I LIKE HER WAY OF TEACHING","Dr. [Removed]'s teaching structure is very clear and helpful to my success. Knowing that I am not set up for failure and have so many resources is a great comfort","She is a very genuine, understanding, and approachable professor. Extremely nice!","I really appreciate this teaching team and all their support!","She is very set on students understanding the material before we move on, which is helpful.","I really enjoy that the professor breaks down the formulas we use and how to apply them.","I really enjoy this class and would recommend this teacher.","I have enjoyed this course quite a bit. It is my favorite course this semester due to the professor, his attitude towards teaching, and teaching style. I find it very easy to ask for help or guidance without any judgement. Professor [Removed] is very easy to speak to and I can tell that he genuinely cares about his students.","I wish that my instructor would slow down on the more complicated topics, because often times the people around me are just as confused as I am so the small group discussions are not effective and we need further instruction.","No. [Removed] [Removed] is a fine teacher who uses Dr. [Removed]'s lectures and notes to format her lectures. It's really just that simple.","I wished there was like a concept check that we could do on our own outside of class after the lectures.","I like the instructor's optimistic attitude towards the class while constantly encouraging that we can pass, make mistakes, and learn. It is great to have a vocal support system for students who might not have any or a lot.","I like how much resources my professor gives me for the exams. I just wished she went more in depth with the lectures and doesn't just go over what's already on the slides. I feel like I always need to reteach myself what she taught during the lectures instead of her teaching me.","I enjoy the way Professor [Removed] gives us examples to practice on but often my brain does not work fast enough to answer the question on my own before she provides the answer. However, I understand that time is limited and their are specific topics she must complete to stay on track!","The instructor is cool and very down to [Removed].","I think Prof. [Removed] does a great job at keeping me engaged during lecture. Her lectures are optional ( which is nice because I don't stress about missing because of uncontrollable life circumstances ) but I really like going because I feel like I learn a lot from them. Statistics was a really hard class for me in [Removed] School but I feel like I understand what we've learned in [Removed] so far.","For the last four questions, this is a science class.   Other than talking about who did what, we can not really go into that much detail.   I think he does a really good job teaching us what we need to know for our future classes.","I think she has done very well with trying to understand where the students are. She has also done well with explaining everything when someone is confused.","Professor [Removed] is very encouraging and always reminds us that it's okay if we don't pass or do well on a test.   She says it's one grade and it doesn't define us.   For me, that's very comforting, and it makes mistakes more acceptable.","I appreciate that instructor's office hours are frequent, convenient, and laid back. The atmosphere is light hearted and not intimidating, facilitating an environment in which I feel comfortable asking questions.","He's a great teacher who does not strictly think in physics in order to foster a liking and understanding of physics in students, being effective in doing so.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor! The Learning Modules are extremely helpful to complete before class, primarily because it's easier to understand as she goes more in - depth in the topic. I enjoy all of the resources she provides for her students in regards to exam preparation.","He goes through information quickly which makes it hard to keep up, but he is approachable to ask questions.","She's a great person but I wish she would include some more information in her lecture slides. for example, types of gene interaction ( like additive ) was a question on the practice problems worksheet but I couldn't find it anywhere on the lecture slides. She briefly mentioned it in class but it was mainly from the textbook where we can learn the information","I would prefer to have professors that have open - note exams with exams weighing lower than our homework. If a professor helps us prepare for our future classes in the major, that would be helpful.","The instructor really minds when there is whispering in the lecture hall. And while this is nice and she promotes a quiet environment, I find there to be many times where I don't notice any whispering and we stop class to address the small amount of whispering there is. This halt leads us to getting less information than other sections.","Nothing. She is just an amazing professor.","I'm not a fan of having to talk to my neighbor every class. It discourages me to go because I have anxiety. I'd rather have them teach and use an interactive discussion board if that's what they want. They want us to teach each other and I believe that's the professors job.","Dr. [Removed] offers a very welcoming classroom environment. Despite the difficulty of this course, he ensures we are all gaining valuable knowledge from our lecture. Throughout lecture he teaches using physical models, student questions, real world examples, and walks us through practice problems.","Nothing specific.","That one time Dr. [Removed] passed out cough drops to students who were coughing made me feel like he genuinely cares about his students' well being","He says that time spent \" complaining about homework \" is better spent elsewhere. However, I don't think he realizes how difficult his homework questions are for someone who has not taken physics recently -- or at all.","I think [Removed] is a great instructor and so is the TA. They are helpful and kind. Very encouraging and inspiring","I would like [Removed] to utilize lecture time as learning time, not review time over content in homework.","I do not like how our instructor is inconsistent with the amount of time spent on each slide. It feels like the material is being rushed toward the end of class.","[Removed] Test Review Session","She is great and teaches very well!","I like how Professor [Removed] gave us motivation tips during exam week. However, I don't enjoy having to teach myself the material before we learn it in class because it makes me more confused.","Our instructor and TA are always floating around the world to observe our work to make sure we're doing everything right, and if we have questions they'll walk over to help us and make sure we completely understand before going to float again. They never get mad at us for making mistakes and just want us to learn from us, and they have made me feel like there are no stupid questions.","Nothing else except I wish the quizzes were easier. Having multiple prelabs with [Removed] of possible questions seems like busy work.","I love the fact that he offers corrections on exams, because especially in a class like physics, you need practice to truly understand what you're doing. And I think having the incentive of doing corrections [Removed] encourages learning of the material. This is my second time taking the course and my experience with this professor has been 10 times better, I actually feel like he cares about us understanding the material.","I like the way the TA's taught during discussions more than the lectures.","I really appreciate how encouraging and nonjudgmental she is when helping us with the content.","Dr. [Removed] also consistently uses physical models to demonstrate the concepts we are about to learn in class, or the concept we just learned depending on if the model comes before or after learning the concepts.","I love Dr. [Removed] passion, however the content and rigor of this course is inevitable and does not compare. I feel a little more understanding when it came to grading exams and homework's would be nice. The material is hard and as a student I can guarantee we are doing the best we possibly can even when our grades don't reflect that.","The instructor created a very welcoming environment. He made it very clear that he was available to ask for help. He had a good amount of office hours and catered well to the students who needed assistance.","It would be difficult for the professor to make sure all students understood the material before moving on as this class is very large, but it does help that there are TAs ready to help you when needed.","He's overall energy and mood during class is positive. He's very passionate about physics and he's actions shows that.","Office hours are really helpful.","Dr. [Removed] is passionate about helping his students succeed and understand class material. He is willing to spend additional time with students to help them work through their struggles experienced in class. Dr. [Removed] is also very thorough and makes a point to answer and resolve any and all questions / conflicts presented to him.","She always checks in for anyone who has questions which makes me feel very comfortable.","[Removed] has been one of my favorite instructors because of his relaxed and welcoming approach to getting to know everybody and breaking the ice between students. It's just a great atmosphere on the class and always feels like a safe space in which I can share my opinions, which I do think depends partly on the instructor of the class.","The instructor is extremely kind and understanding. She is always open to questions and always offers to help us in any way possible. I am really enjoying this class as a result, and I look forward to it every week.","When I was struggling with a family emergency and had to go home, Dr. [Removed] was very patient and gave me time to be with my family and complete my assignments with no penalties.","Professor is a great chemistry professor for dealing with a very large class","I really appreciate Dr. [Removed]'s apparent care for his students and his passion for teaching others. He shares valuable life experiences and examples that help us connect concepts to the real world. It is clear that he loves his job and wants others to enjoy learning and gain something from his course.","Teaching style is very effective.","She kind of motivated me to keep going and try to do better in her course. She explained that if you didn't get a score that you liked on an Exam, leave it in the past and don't let it discourage you. She said all it's going to do is create a pessimistic look that potentially makes you feel that way for future tests to come. Ultimately, she said to just use this as a fresh start to try and do better for the next exam to come.","Not all exam questions are not very similar to the homework, there are certain concepts that are hard to understand when not related to real life. However, her specific squarecap questions keep my attention on the lectures","I absolutely love this class. I don't take it very seriously on an academic standpoint, but this class has given me so much insight on material that is typically not showcased in my regular subjects. I would never have known how to navigate myself through registration if it wasn't for them.","She's really nice and comforting.","I would like to advise any professor, when teaching, to ensure that the material they test students on is appropriately and well taught in class-- enough to where students are confident in themselves when preparing for their exam.","During the first two weeks she asked us to talk to the people sitting next to us about something, I am not too sure what it was, but I remember it actually being a very awkward conversation with the people around me and I would have liked a more like lighthearted or fun discussion question.","I think doing a kind of surveys about what students are confused or how comfortable they are in an assignment about to later give them some more feedback.","I really enjoy the flipped classroom style because I feel like when I do the homework before class I come into class knowing more and the concepts click better for me.","Nothing at all so far, liking the class!","All assignments should be posted to [Removed] in advance. It is frustrating when the pre - labs are hidden on [Removed], and all the posted assignments don't even have the included link to complete the assignment ( ethics board ).","I really love how Dr. [Removed] arrange the course material per unit. It is very neat and reachable. So, its easier for us to study.","I feel like [Removed]. [Removed] has done a great job so far!","Overall, Dr. [Removed] provides many useful resources from undergrad research opportunities, practice problems, office hours, online unit reviews from TAs, and even external resources beyond class material for more curious students.","One thing I would like to add is that Dr. [Removed] often times spends awkward amounts of time on different topics of varied difficulty during lecture. For example, she may teach at a much slower pace at the beginning, giving students multiple minutes to discuss very simple topics that had already been clearly answered before. This will leave little time at the end of lecture to adequately explain harder and more detailed topics, so it seems like she rushes at the end at times to make sure she gets through all of her slides for the day. This results in my peers and myself to be overly confident on a topic we already understood but still lost on the important ones that she rushed through during the last 5 minutes of lecture.","I think first off its difficult to fully answer this survey as I've only been part of the course for around 6 weeks. That being said, while its difficult for Professor [Removed] to really integrate discussions in her lectures, I would appreciate it more if she made class a bit more interactive.","Your lectures are fantastic but so quick! I envy the way we can fit so much information in such little time ; however, at first this was a difficult adjustment. I can say that a lot of this is learning on our own, but if people listen to lectures and are willing to ask questions, it's greatly helpful. I appreciate you for answering all our questions and giving little tidbits of information to us!","The instructor's encouragement and recognition of our progress made me feel more confident and motivated to tackle challenging tasks. Their supportive approach created a positive learning environment where I felt valued and capable of applying what I had learned.","I do not believe so.","I love how caring Dr. [Removed] is about her students and prioritizes our wellbeing. She often sends out messages reminding us to take a breath and get enough sleep and make sure that we are taking care of ourselves.","Very accommodating and understanding that not everything will click the first go around so she takes time to review every class.","Dr. [Removed] made class feel like a very constructive and friendly environment while encouraging participation.","I like the way my professor teaches! I sometimes wish the in - class quizzes had more questions because there are usually 5 questions and if I miss one, I am at an 80.","The only thing is that I got [Removed] and had to quarantine for a whole week, but I still had to sacrifice my free absence days even though I wasn't allowed to be in class, otherwise I would get others sick. I believe that for medical reasons, even if we have allowances for missing class, it should not consume these days in case you have a personal emergency etc.","caudill is great.","No I am grateful for my amazing TA and instructor.","I feel like Dr. [Removed] is a very understanding teacher and gives all of her students many options to pick from in order to earn credit in her class. She also has a 24 hr grade period for late assignments which is very helpful when most of her students are taking other rigorous courses. I believe that she is a great teacher and cares very much for her students and their time and personal lives.","There is not much to say other than he is a doing a good job and helping students in the course.","She's really nice but it condescending sometimes when people ask questions. She'll ask us if we have any questions and he first response is well did you read the textbook if you reply yes then she goes well it's really easy. Then proceeds to answer your questions. Other than that she is kind and willing to help but when you get talked to like that it makes you feel like you can't ask questions.","He seems to be a very sweet genuine man who wants success for his students. He sometimes emphasizes things that are not of importance which makes the course a little confusing but does give an adequate amount of material to study and for the most part explains everything in class.","Prof. [Removed] is a good physics teacher","She's nice I like her. Interested in her field.","This instructor is very open - minded and has a wide variety of curriculum she covers so that we are well - rounded, aware students not only in the genetics class but as a whole on this campus.","he talks to fast and he talks to us like we know the content but I don't and I would like to get more details on the content","She is extremely flexible and makes me feel comfortable in class even though physics is out of my comfort zone.","I would like to say that I've thoroughly enjoyed this class thus far, and look forward to learning about the new content in the upcoming weeks. I would also like to say the class has been very engaging and has provided so many resources to help me ensure that I understand the material.","The most impactful thing that Dr. [Removed] has said in lecture, in my opinion, is that no question is a stupid question. No matter what question someone asks, he is happy to answer it, and always does so in a way that makes sense. This sentiment that no question is a stupid question has empowered me to speak up in this class when I am usually pretty quiet in other classes, and I am sure other students feel the same.","His general demeanor is very welcoming and respectful. He seems to understand very well what it is like to be a student","I'd say he a great instructor overall. Very laid back and capable at creating students capable of passing this course.","No. Dr. [Removed] is teaching a great physics class.","I don't feel like the lectures are very helpful.","Dr. [Removed] is a big fan of the growth mindset and I appreciate that he acknowledges that physics can be difficult for some students, but you can still learn and become proficient at it.","i don't really like the structure of the class. It feels like I should be doing most of the new concept learning during the prelectures but I never feel like I have enough time so I end up just skimming until I come up with a question. Because the lectures are so heavily influenced by the prelectures, I end up being kind of lost and not feeling like I'm learning anything in class. I feel like I'm only learning when I'm doing the homeworks and have to go back through the textbook to figure out what's going on.","My instructor is very personable and wants us to have fun in lab rather than just be robots that follow instructions and get good grades.","Sometimes my instructors make us feel like they're one of us. The are very welcoming and approachable and any question is a good question to them. I don't feel afraid to talk to them or ask them for anything.","I love her formatting style of teaching as it really lets me grasp my understanding of the material!","i like that he is very nice and understanding","I think Dr. [Removed] gives us so many resources to study which is the key to success in this class.","He doesn't do much, he reviews the slides and adds a couple items of note that are not included on the slides or textbook, but the relevancy of said notes are unclear. Alongside this, understanding him is a challenge as a result of his accent, tone, and speed of his talking voice. I hear and fully understand every couple words, taking notes with this is more difficult than it should be as I often mishear and misunderstand what he says during lecture.","Suffering through the class because the test doesn't really reflect what you learn since your grade can go down with a simple mistake on a conceptual questions","More practice problems in this class. I feel like I have all the resources to learn it, but nowhere to apply it so it does not get understood as much as it could be.","I would like more practice problems that are similar difficulty to the exam so it gives us better practice for the exam.","- My professor has made a lot of office hours and community study sessions available which i find extremely helpful \n - she's very sweet and easy to approach and talk to \n - the class can sometimes get boring but I still enjoy the material \n - I find it really helpful that she makes the lectures interactive so that we can learn from and teach our peers.","I like how she encourages us to talk to our peers and tries to make the test as fair as possible.","Yes, Dr. [Removed] is a very upbeat type of person who brings energy into her lectures. She keeps the people in her lectures involved by constantly having us talk to each other about problems that are on the screen.","I love that Professor [Removed] gives half the points back on the exams. It helps me stay calm and less anxious when I take the exams, which ultimately makes me do better. I also think it establishes that students are more than just their test scores and builds a healthy relationship with learning. I think this shows how Professor [Removed] cares about the well - being of his students.","I really like making reading the textbook before class a part of the grade as that makes the lectures feel SO MUCH better than in some of my previous physics classes, where I would try and look at the textbook as little as possible and gleam everything from long, incredibly dense lectures. Of course that's on me, but this style of learning is much more receptive to me. Also, Dr. [Removed] is a really good teacher. He asks if you understand something after he answers your question and will often check in with the TA during class to see if they can offer more information, or put something in a different way for us, or ask a question they might have about the lecture, which is great for us and the TA! Because we aren't learning everything in class, the lectures feel much more free and lighthearted, almost ; there is of course structure, but a lot of room for us to ask questions so we can get insight on what is confusing us instead of going over everything at the same pace, which is often too fast or too slow. Starting the class with a kind of fun, up for interpretation occasionally, [Removed], helps get the class in the right mindset to learn too.","no I think she is great","He is not bad at lecturing. I do wish that the slides had information on them, so that I can reference later outside of class. Sometimes he seems a little desperate for students' attention, but other than that, it's a pretty decent class.","I love the collaborative setting to be able to work together.","I didn't always understand the basic processes. Often he uses examples to help us see, but often it is a little too specific and confusing because he skipped over a more in - depth process description. I also have a difficult time knowing when something is important. I understand that we should learn all we can, but when it comes to studying there is a limited amount of time and brain space. I do appreciate his square caps and discusion sections because they provide additional questions to review before the test so we can become more aquatinted with his style. Overall, he is a very kind and understanding prof, but I don't think his style works for me.","The instructor is always excited to teach the class and comes with a positive attitude which is reflected upon the class and is overall a really amazing thing a professor can do","I love Dr. [Removed] as a professor! This is my second time having her and I chose this class because I saw she was teaching it! So likable and wants the best for her students.","It is not really a class that deserves feedback. It is set up to set us students up for success and to share resources the university provides.","I wish that she would give go more into detail on the newer information to college freshman and not spend so much time on the already known things, such as electronic configurations and such. Also feel like the class could be much shorter if she got through content faster and didn't let distractions slow her down.","Dr. [Removed] provides extra credit opportunities, which I appreciate. It is more important for me to achieve excellence rather than perfection. I had a professor in the past implement \" zombie questions \" on exams. This is when they include the most missed problems on the next exam. I think this method ensures that students learn from their mistakes and is more effective than adding a curve or bonus points on an exam.","I appreciate how he goes over problems with us to make sure we have a good understanding of all the concepts.","I really liked that at the very beginning of the first couple classes, Dr. [Removed] asked us fun questions as ice breakers to talk about with our neighbor, which made it less awkward to talk to them about the material when prompted later in class.","I have not heard it said during class, but I am sure he does","She has been very sweet, understanding, approachable and made my first lab less underwhelming. I also had to miss many labs due to illness and she was understanding and made the experience very low stress.","I feel as though not much has been done to have a significant impact on my feelings towards college or the class.","I think he teaches very well, slowly, in an understanding and empathetic way. He does not shame any \" stupid \" questions, or when students get answers incorrect. In class we do a couple practice problems and then have more practice problems to do for homework. Some questions on the homework however, are difficult, so I wish that he could review those more in class or in a video recording instead of just during office hours since many of us can not make it to those timings. I also wish he could provide us with more practice problems besides the homeworks and exam reviews. On quest we can do more problems just with different numbers, but I would like wholly different problems so I can set up the questions in different ways.","She's a good teacher I like her.","He is very kind and approachable","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind man who is visibly passionate about biology. Unfortunately, his lectures are confusing, and the resources given to learn are limited and unhelpful. Most students rely on the textbook and outside resources - such as [Removed] videos - to stay caught up with the material.","For me, a lot of information is repeated to the point where I think it's redundant. However, many of my peers will ask questions that make it seem like they don't understand certain concepts. I might try and find more ways to explain each concept in the course in order to make teaching the material more efficient.","She's nice but the class is going very fast","I like how the class is structured around self learning, and the lectures are more a summary then they are new learning. This allows me to work at my own pace and form my own understanding of the material before the lecture, then test it during lecture.","Good energy and she likes the topic.","I liked how engaging the professor tries to make her class!","It was such a hard course to study because the lecture did not explain the basics at all ( basic concepts, terminology, etc. ) and had all of them for the students to study by themselves through learning modules. The modules were hard to read, text - heavy were always uploaded late and required much more time commitment than the lecture. \n Also the professor didn't cover the whole materials before the exam in the lecture","I don't blame her for not doing most of this because the class is so large, it is just unrealistic.","The instructors are very thoughtful and obviously care a lot about the students and make sure that everyone feels heard and understood. This has made the classroom a very inclusive and supportive environment where the students are able to fully express their opinions and feel comfortable enough to share their own thoughts and experiences with the whole class.","It's not exactly an issue because we don't have exams in the course.","I believe that the professor is great. She cares about her students and is always available to answer questions.","I like that [Removed] was able to introduce himself which allowed us to be more comfortable asking question and so that we are not hesitant to do so. I appreciate how both instructors set this course up as it is very engaging to me.","At times it seems like important information is said so fast that I can not write it down or type it fast enough. It could be helpful to repeat key ideas so there is time to absorb it.","Maybe focusing only on the material that'll be on the next exam rather than going more in depth on details that won't be asked.","He is genuinely very nice and funny. His lectures are kept short and packed with information. His exams so far have been pretty fair and the grading scheme is very good.","Nothing else really, great lectures and clear about what she is asking on assignments.","She's been a really good listener as we continue to seek help and support from her, she's even helped us by moving her due dates and times for us.","Dr. [Removed] is a very laid back professor in a way where he provides a calm learning environment during class. That allows to not feel stressed out during class and comfortable when I do not understand something the first time it is taught to me. His TAs are always engaged during class and he always encourages group collaboration and full class participation when learning new topics.","Nothing really. Dr. [Removed] has been a great professor so far and I like how he really tries to connect us to the course with things like demos or space stuff.","Professor [Removed] is extremely kind, caring, and truly wants the best for her students!","Just always making me and other students feel like they are on the right track complimenting our achievements and reassuring us from our failures","I only have positive things to say. He seems to really care about us learning and is very understanding towards students. He also does a good job explaining material.","I liked [Removed], my TA, very much and she's been very helpful. However, I do not retain much from Dr. [Removed]'s lectures since he goes too fast, has vague slides, little resources, and does not answer emails.","I like my instructor and I like the structure of the course so far, so I'm interested in seeing what comes next","Professor [Removed] is an excellent professor. I really am enjoying her class.","The professor redirected us to the [Removed] health center and advised therapy. The professor did not appear to be able to help students individually outside of academics.","I love Dr. [Removed]. She is interesting and she really seems to care about the learning of the students and our well being.","Being in Professor [Removed] [Removed] [Removed] course, I have found that we are not able to learn from our mistakes, instead I feel as though I must know the material perfectly. I feel as though I am not growing as a student who is able to understand statistics.","This instructor was great, she'll make sure you pass the class with flying colors as long as you put the work in.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor and lecturer","does not know how to teach, scribbles on slides. 600 students confused without an idea of what s going on.","I really enjoy when professors do practice problems from the homework.","I really love how the instructor seems like she loves the content she is teaching.","I really enjoy the motivation that the instructors provide.","She is the sweetest instructor I have ever had who genuinely cares for her students. She is amazing at teaching and there is no one else I would rather have for this class.","He's just a very cool and nice person and I appreciate how generous he is with what can be graded and allowing corrections on exams which is an encouragement of possible failure and an allowing of failure to be ok at the same time.","Dr. [Removed] is a very kind professor. He provides informative lectures in addition to very helpful office hours. My struggle with the course lies in understanding what the correct formula / approach is for a problem. I feel like the material before the first exam was better explained than the material currently, as I am now starting to have issues with formula identification. I may just require more exposure to the material.","Dr. [Removed] is very nice and her attitude makes me want to attend her lectures. I was scared about this course but she has made the concepts very simple in how she describes things and I know I have her support if I ever need help with anything.","She is a great professor and   teaches in the best way possible","I liked how much he stressed the important concepts.","Super considerate and genuinely cares about your learning and overall wellbeing inside and outside of class.","Dr. [Removed] and her teaching assistants created a very welcoming and supportive classroom environment, which significantly enhanced my learning experience. Their approachability and constant readiness to help with any difficulties made it easier to engage with the course content and reach out for assistance without hesitation. They frequently checked in on students' understanding during and after lectures and were always available for extra help during office hours.","Dr. [Removed] has had us work together on a few worksheets during class, which I have found helpful. I like also having activities in class that help me actually use / answer questions with the material that I've learned -- I find that it really helps my learning.","I would like to say that sometimes Dr. [Removed] has a judgemental tone when students answer a question wrong. I don't think she means to do this, but it is sometimes discouraging.","There is nothing else I'd like to share.","No there is no extra information","I think the professor is great! The hardest aspect of the class has to do with how the lab is run. The lab expects a lot of prior knowledge that we haven't covered yet in class. Thus I often feel very confused and don't understand what we are doing in the lab because it is dealing with concepts we haven't talked about yet in class.","I think the professor is great!","He seems like a very genuine guy who wants us to succeed but I am not sure he has the experience that allows him to know where our key points of struggle tends to be.","None! [Removed] is doing a GREAT job.","He's a great professor.","He is a great instructor and really cares about all of the students in the class. High praise from me, and I would definitely recommend to everyone for this course.","The instructor's approach was practical and supportive, providing clear guidelines on how to collaborate with classmates and access resources for foundational knowledge. While it didn't stand out as anything extraordinary, the consistency in their communication made it easier to understand expectations and navigate the course. This helped reduce uncertainty and made the course manageable, though it didn't significantly change my overall experience.","It frustrates me that the slides in the lecture materials are not the same slides you show during the lecture- I know it is not all that important but I would like every piece of information I can get.","I asked her a question once at the beginning of class and she answered very passive aggressively. The question was literally about a medical issue I was having and she told me “ You know my ta's are happy to answer any questions. ” I did not think I should have told them and she answered with such rudeness. Also, her slideshows are very messy and she is not a good teacher in general. Everyone I have talked to who has her has a complaint about her.","I love professor [Removed], she is so lively and personable. Even though the concepts we cover in class are relatively simple she makes it fun and keeps us involved and entertained, which I love about the class and this instructor.","In terms of feedback, I like the way the course is structured right now! Gives ample time to learn the material, practice, go to Lab or [Removed] while not taking up an excessive amount of time outside of class to do these tasks.","Sometimes Dr. [Removed] goes really fast during lectures so sometimes it would be nice if he paused so we could have a second to write everything down.","He is a good professor","On the very first class day, he shared that he went through some tough times during his freshmen year of college, which affected his GPA ( can't really specify [Removed] of [Removed], and idk who's all going to read this survey ). He went on to add additional encouraging words about how we can overcome challenges. I, too, had tanked my GPA my freshman year because of some mental health challenges. Although I have been showing upper trends as far as grades go since then, I have always been disappointed in myself because I thought I was making \" excuses \" for my bad grades, although I did go through some of the most challenging times. Listening to Dr. [Removed] being vulnerable has helped me to feel better about myself when trying to study. I need to go talk to him and share my story!","He is very understanding and smart.","Our instructor helped us find soil.","I really enjoy my instructor she is really attentive and is always welcoming to answer any questions or concerns we might have","I can tell Professor [Removed] has spent many years perfecting the structure of his course that creates a perfect balance of learning motivation and effort while not being too overwhelming in such a content - heavy course.","not really, they're super supportive and amazing","My instructor is very positive and he always includes student in the class and makes it a very interactive experience. He makes the knowledgable course more enjoyable.","I would like it if Dr. [Removed] would take more time to explain the “ why ” of things that occur content wise but other than that it's fine.","She is a great teacher and very supportive and taught me about growth mindsets.","I like the class and teacher but the course organization leaves something to be desired. It is a very non - linear class with a lot of jumping around and finding different resources to learn things. I would prefer a more cohesive method ( like maybe a textbook?? ) rather than the curriculum which I feel relies on canvas too heavily and is disorganized for someone not already familiar with the material.","I really enjoy how the professor will come up to us while we are working on our class activities to ask us how we are doing not only with the material but in life in general.","Love her. Took her for [Removed] for [Removed] and she is the best. [Removed] on my top 5 profs at [Removed].","The instructor hasn't done anything negative, the class has been nothing but relaxing.","I like the overall class structure. It's more practice worksheet which is the best way to applying coding daily to learn much quicker.","Dr. [Removed] is one of the most encouraging professors I've had at [Removed]. [Removed] is a challenging subject ( and one I've personally never learned before ), but she aims to make it simple and accessible to everyone in her class. She encourages making mistakes and emphasizes their importance in the learning process. Finally, she talks about her own challenges and failures in her career. As someone who has struggled academically but still wants to be successful in my field, her dedication to sharing her story has made an incredible difference in my life. I truly believe her attitude and approach to teaching is one of, if not the most, encouraging I've come across at [Removed]. Science can feel inaccessible at times and Dr. [Removed] is moving mountains in her mission to create an environment where students feel comfortable and confident in their ability to learn.","The only thing that could be a little hard to deal with during his class is his accent but, outside of putting subtitles on the screen, I'm not sure if anything could be done to change this. He does have [Removed] videos which feature the same lectures though, so that's also a potential resource for people who can't understand most of his lectures. Also, we can always just ask him or the TAs questions after class, so that helps too.","No, there's nothing else that I can think of to share.","I still love her tho, its ok if she doesn't share her personal life.","I really enjoy how engaging my professor makes the lectures. Most other classes are not hands - on, but this one allows me to learn by doing, which is how I have always learned best. I appreciate her commitment to making sure everyone understands what is going on.","I feel as though the lectures are a bit loosely structured, and in order to truly learn in the class you must take some time to digest the information outside of class hours. I'm not opposed to this and I think this should be the norm for classes, but it is sometimes hard to learn when irrelevant discussions occur throughout the lecture.","I really enjoy Dr. [Removed]' classes. Her classes are one of the few that I feel like I actually learned from because she uses active learning and she provides us with the proper materials to study for exams. I can tell by the way she teaches that she is passionate about helping others learn and sharing knowledge. Even if her classes make you put in a little more effort than others, I think the output of the course is much greater than most.","I like Dr. [Removed] and I think she is great about being fair to her students, I just wish that sometimes the class was a bit more engaging.","I really like my professor Dr. [Removed] and I think he is amazing! I came into this class with no recent biology background ( I last learned biology during [Removed] ) so I was very nervous I wouldn't understand or do well. However, he is such a great professor that I don't feel behind the other kids and he explains the material in a way that helps me understand which I really like. Overall I like this class and I think Dr. [Removed] is a great professor and I would 100 % recommend him to other students. Also, I had a [Removed] this semester named [Removed] and she is fantastic!! She helped me fill in any gaps of knowledge I was missing and found great ways for me to remember the content of it was something I was struggling with. She is very patient and kind and I'm so grateful to have her as my [Removed]. I definitely recommend her for other students because so is so helpful and amazing!!","I like the structure of her class, and her learning modules are helpful. She offers a lot of good resources to help us succeed in the class.","The main instructor has been extremely helpful and clear with directions when necessary.","Nothing else, she has done a great job and I'm happy with her class.","She's very nice and has been a really good professor.","The lectures are nice but I often feel somewhat unprepared for the test even though I've used all the resources given, including active recall.","The professor made the class feel kind of stale at times, like it was just information on information without taking a second to tell a joke or ease the tension in the room. It felt like an hour and 15 minutes of information","Assignments were posted inconsistently, with many longer modules being posted the day before they were supposed to be due relatively late in the day. This put me and many other students in a bind before lectures.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor who I can tell wants nothing but for his students to do well in his class. With that said, I think it is vital for him to see that the topics he covers in class I feel may be vague in terms of what he wants us to know for his exams. I feel as though what we cover in lecture is only the icing on the cake, and we therefore, learn material and equations outside of class that are not spoken about in lecture at all. Especially in a [Removed] I class where much of us have never been exposed to [Removed] before, this can be frustrating and difficult.","I believe it would be helpful if, instead of relying heavily on slides or scientific jargon, she used real - world examples or analogies to explain the processes.","I really like her :) I think she's really great and I love having all the study resources","Maybe ask if we understand before moving on since the material moves along very quickly \n","She always posts learning modules on canvas so we can do them before class and get a better understanding of the material before lecture.","I believe this instructor is very fair and she is really good at explaining things in office hours.","Dr. [Removed] does a good job at encouraging students to ask questions and to visit office hours so he can clear up any confusion in this very challenging course.","Very cool and nice professor, very cool TA &amp; LA","Dr. [Removed] makes it a point to learn our names and she is incredibly kind and caring. She is an amazing professor.","Dr. [Removed] is very supportive and offers many benefits throughout the course to ensure that students do well in her class.","The way Dr. [Removed] teaches is very difficult for me because he just flys through the slides so I do not learn much. However the discussion class is very helpful for me. There are lots of resources that help a lot and I really like how Dr. [Removed] believes in all of us.","She had fun experiments during class that made the class more enjoyable.","I think [Removed] is a great professor and is very good at explaining the concepts he teaches.","Can we get more practice indicative of how the tests can be in class, and also more structured practices during discussion that doesn't seem so difficult, or has questions that build on each other to help develop a deeper understanding of the concept.","I like the pace that she teaches at and I think the homework / quizzes are representative of what we are learning during class. I also think she gives the right amount of assignments to grasp the material and not any busy work.","Was super helpful during office hours and makes this course not feel stressful due to how much she helps us and provides us with so many resources to succeed","I appreciate the professor being understanding of possible situations students are going through as well as offering numerous ways to study so that there is almost every type of option out there, ensuring everyone can study the best of their ability.","She's very involved with the students and I really appreciate that for such a technical course.","The quizzes are easy to understand and she goes over everything that will be on the quizzes and posts reviews and practices which is very helpful.","She is very nice!","Dr. [Removed] had given insightful comments in class such as : \n “ See me as a coach. Not a football coach, but a [Removed]'s [Removed] coach. ” \n ( When explaining charge density ) “ It's like you're baking a cake with raisins. You wanna calculate the raisin density per unit of volume. ” \n Dr. [Removed] adjusts the closing time of each [Removed] question based on everyone's speed at the time. \n She also gave us choice to opt out from discussion sessions and lectures, which will make the HWs would be worth more.","I like the structure of the course, the expectations are clear and the exams are designed well in a way that makes it easy to do well as long as you put in the work.","I really appreciate how the instructor set up the [Removed] page. It is easy to navigate and additional help is easy to find - such as office hours.","I wish there was more guidance on how to learn so much information. As an introductory biology course it would be easier on our grades of homework wasn't just one submission","Dr. [Removed] is comfortable with making jokes and laughing a bunch in class, which makes the learning environment feel so much more friendly.","I really like that the instructor is extremely clear when clarifying any misunderstandings about a question or concept that I do not understand.","I think he's a great professor. He enjoys the content.","I liked my instructor, but I didn't pay that much to details or to everything they said. I don't remember enough to meaningfully answer some of the questions.","The learning modules in the class are helpful, but sometimes when instructor goes over the topic in lecture, she makes it confusing when it wasn't before.","She has made it very easy for me to focus and learn.","Well there really good preofessors","She is very friendly and makes understanding difficult concepts a bit easier.","she constantly tells us its [Removed] to not be good at physics right now and that its OK to feel not good enough and that we can all improve she js a girl boss","I really like how engaging the lectures are. The students are consistently part of the lecture through the in - class [Removed] questions and discussions. I think this is one of the best aspects of this class. It allows me to remain focused / engaged for a longer period of time.","A lot of information is presented quickly, in a small amount of time, and the study resources aren't very helpful for me to perform well in the exams.","Posting learning modules the night before a lecture is a bit stressful, as it does not give me enough time to complete material that is significant to understanding the lecture the next day","I really appreciated how much my instructor vocalized that he cared about his students well being because it made me feel important.","Our professor often stops class to stop kids from whispering/ talking. Although I understand that the talking can be distracting, I myself never notice or get bothered by it. I think it is more distracting to stop class every 5 minutes. Its also frustrating for the kids who never talk and still get class time wasted due to other students who can't keep quiet. I would recommend just asking them to leave if they are talking instead of taking the class time to make them stop.","The pre lessons that she posts make it way easier to understand the in class lectures.","Dr. [Removed] is very patient with us, and it is evident that she wants us to understand the material. It is also obvious that she enjoys what she does. Even though her class is at 8 am, she makes jokes to keep us engaged. Her office hours are great as well. She acknowledges every person and encourages them to ask questions. She also encourages us to work together during office hours. She is always validating us by saying the material can be challenging, but she provides us with the way she would approach the problems. I truly believe that Dr. [Removed] cares about her students.","the class is very quickly paced and i feel the structure could be slowed down for student success.","[Removed] always makes sure that we are in a safe environment and that our concerns are valid and she provides a classroom where we can grow personally and professionally.","Dr. [Removed] is a genuine and kind professor who wants to see his students succeed. He is helpful and actively gets students to participate in class, which is important in cultivating growth.","During lab, it can be hard to hear the instructor and oftentimes she doesn't speak up. Due to not being able to hear her, I don't have a very clear understanding of the things she is discussing and sometimes get confused. She also moves quickly through the material and everything feels rushed. This makes me anxious and I tend to rush through important steps ( especially when learning new techniques ) instead of focusing on proper technique.","Dr. [Removed] is a very caring professor and genuinely hopes the best for her students. She provides us with a lot of studying material and class content. She provides learning objectives for each chapter of the book we are learning, so we know what to focus on during lecture and for the exams.","He reached out to me individually to ask about how I was doing and my performance in the class. Him doing that really means a lot to me, and it reassured me that I have support in this class.","I appreciate all her emails and positive attitude when it comes to learning.","He's actually a good professor my only complaint would be how fast he goes on the lectures and how soon he starts the next unit after just finishing the last. I am studying a new unit while trying to understand the next one and it is pretty hard.","Something I admire a lot in teachers is someone that encourages improvement and learning. In this course so far we are allowed 2 attempts on quizzes which is great since it allows for improvement instead of punishing not succeeding the first time around. I also like that homework is graded on effort, it pushes me to produce the best quality submission I can while not punishing a student if they are wrong. When a course is too strict with grading I find the students within it feel very negative about the material and may even resort to cheating, but when effort is considered more I see people keep trying and be genuinely engaged in the material.","She is very approachable and goes over things we are unable to understand","I think the instructor could do a better job explaining the topic a little bit more. I feel like sometimes, she gives us the answer but doesn't explain how she got there. Other than that, she is a great professor and all the extra resources are very helpful.","I like how the professor and TA's are constantly walking around the lab and are available for asking questions throughout the whole lab period.","No, everything is good, just the tests are very hard.","He is very nice and obviously cares for students. I think the HWs are really hard [Removed].","This professor will talk about the importance of mental and emotional wellness and how it ties into academic success, and ties in her own experiences with it. I think this has been very beneficial and is very relevant and relatable to alot of students, and personally I have found that it makes me feel more understood, motivated, and relaxed when learning. I greatly appreciate this and think it's great!","Dr [Removed] is a helpful teacher when it comes to answering specific questions and explaining the contextual larger picture of what is being taught in lecture.","I really liked talking about the applications of what learned in class. In addition whenever I ask a question the professor always makes it feel like a valid question.","The instructor is very thorough with his teaching methods and I have no doubt that if students are having difficulty with the class content, he is more than happy to help.","Great class! Professor [Removed] helps make it easy to understand and wants his students to learn and succeed.","I like that Professor [Removed] uses in class experimental data to prove a certain topic that we're learning because it makes me actively participate instead of just being told that something is correct just because some said so. This really helped my understanding of the material.","I think she is a great instructor, she tries to turn a difficult class into a fun one, and does a good job. It is challenging, but she is a good lecturer and she is funny, so the class is still fun even though it is difficult.","I would like to say that Dr. [Removed] is a great professor. She makes sure her students are engaged in class and does her best to make her students have the opportunities to be successful.","The professor has a syllabus that states all the expected dates which is common. This is the only form that we have about makeup policy etc. This is a good form of communication so there is no confusion.","He's great, just wish the homework's and test were more in line with the questions he asks in class","I really like the way Dr. [Removed] has structured the course. The worksheets have been great help, as I have always been the type to learn best by example. It really helps to look back on previous work. I like that we use R [Removed] instead of copying our code on a separate doc like I had to do in other classes, and I like that it is predominantly project based and \" learn as you go \". As someone with test anxiety I feel this is the best way for me to truly show my skills.","I feel like she can't answer questions just because the class is so big.   I don't believe it is negligence to the topic.","Not that I can think of!","She makes me feel hopeless. Genuinely like I have no chance in the class no matter how much I study or try.","The instructor seems kind and understanding of students and encouraging of student success in her course.","Dr. [Removed] is super awesome.","The instructor can move a bit fast at times but overall good professor.","She is doing very well and provides a lot of resources for us","I appreciate how Professor [Removed] [Removed] tries to run physical demonstrations of the concepts we're talking about during lectures. It helps me better understand the material.","Dr. [Removed] makes class really fun. Love her demos","I feel like it's difficult when professors assume that everyone already knows stuff about the content. It's kind of defeating when you actually don't know anything about it. Sometimes when people asks questions and are confused about the content, she says that it's easy and doesn't see how they're confused about the content but for most people, this is their first experience to this content which makes them feel stupid.","Great professor","She's very personable and shares times from moments that she also made mistakes and it creates a comfortable atmosphere.","She is doing a great job at teaching physics, I can understand the concepts that I am supposed to learn from the way she lectures. I myself am unsure how some of the questions in this survey can be relevant or implemented into a physics class, but I tried to answer the questions to the best of my ability.","she is great and i love her class","I think she is a great teacher and explains her content very well.","She is a good instructor, just sometimes difficult to follow exactly what points she is intending to get across.","The slideshows she creates are incredibly helpful. The situation is complicated but to be short I came in knowing nothing. I had to learn what a valence electron was, then how the periodic table works, then how to combine and integrate knowledge to create things like [Removed] [Removed]. This class assumes that I already know all these things, but even though I don't I have still been able to catch up pretty successfully. But those weekly 5 question quizzes are the worst little grade [Removed] of all time.","Dr. [Removed] is an amazing instructor because you can tell that she cares a lot about her students. She always encourage students to talk to each others and help each other out. The collaborative environment really made me enjoy genetic more than I had expected because I find genetic a really hard subject to learn ; therefore, I am really glad that I am able to collaborate on things such as homework and quizzes. I also thought that it was really comforting that Dr. [Removed] said something about how hard genetic is to learn because there was time I felt like I didn't have the capability to learn genetic. However, knowing that genetic is a relatively hard class, it further encouraged me to try even harder to do well in the class knowing that it is normal to think that genetic is hard.","I like this class.","Something that I appreciate is that our professor understands our situation as a student. In the syllabus and on the first day of class setting expectations, she mentioned how she values progress over perfection. This was really important to me because it can be hard to aim for perfection especially at a higher education level. However, with the help of others that this course provides I feel more open to learning and not closed off. It's okay to make mistakes and it's valuable to learn what learning styles / studying techniques are the most beneficial to you. As I go into college, I have learned a lot about myself and this course has made me feel more comfortable in adapting to the change.","It would be helpful for me if the pre - lab was open beginning on Friday so I could do it earlier over the weekend. It opens for my section on Sunday and I have to do it then because of my class schedule on Monday.","Sometimes I feel that the lectures don't exactly match up with what is on the homework, as people often ask a bunch of questions that aren't related to the topic, which often leads to tangents unrelated to the content.","She makes small talk with us and cares to try to learn our names which I find super sweet and it also keeps me engaged in class because I feel like I am heard in the classroom.","Just that she is very strict and detail oriented with grading and although I see her reasoning, the amount of coursework for a lab and my other 4 classes is a lot and the smallest of mistakes does not seem fair to take off such large sums off of the grades","He seems nice I don't   feel very connected to him or the course because i haven't   been given that opportunity   but he definitely   does put a lot of effort given the large class size.","I like the vibes of this class and encourage y' all to keep it up. It certainly creates a positive experience -- especially since this is my first lab. Thank y' all :)","I think my professor really does care about his students and consistently encourages for us to visit office hours for help.","He is a great professor because unlike most other professors, he cares more about us learning than giving us competitive grades.","I like how Dr. [Removed] reminds us that exam grades aren't everything since we have the chance to retake two at the end of the semester. It makes me less stressed for exams and creates a good learning environment.","No but she is really sweet and understanding.","I overall enjoy the class. It requires a good amount of work, but if you pay attention and study, you will succeed. The professor wants you to do well.","No, I believe I added all that I needed to add.","The instructor is very accommodating to students and allows an opt - out option for lectures and discussions, offering a redistribution of grading percentages to not include attendance. Even though I prefer to attend in - person lectures, this practice made an impression on me because it showed that the professor was understanding of students' needs and understood that people learn differently.","During discussions she brings us snacks which I believe is really thoughtful as genetics can be an intense course at times.","He's very welcoming in office hours","I have nothing else to share.","I wish we used the lecture times more productively, I feel like I am forced to learn all the content outside of class instead of actually during the lecture. Also, it's hard to understand units because we always mix content from later units and overcomplicate details that aren't necessary and it becomes confusing.","Dr. [Removed] is a great professor who wants all of her students to succeed.","Love professor [Removed], she teaches very well and gives a nice vibe to the class, would likely consider being an LA / TA for her as I feel she teaches very well and is very lenient in coursework","I believe [Removed] [Removed] is very sweet and truly demonstrates her care for students and their mental health.","He is very helpful and always guides you to the answer without actually giving it, which allows us to think and get to the answers on our own which helps us actually learn.","I need practice exams, and he does not give anything. Also, the textbook has typos.","Dr. [Removed] is very sweet and knowledgeable, but I often feel intimidated to ask basic questions about some biology concepts. Even her office hours make me nervous. I think offering a discussion section where students refresh on basic biology would be helpful.","She is a very helpful professor who is always willing to help her students learn the material.","I appreciate how the instructor makes tailored Unit Review guides on question types taught during class. Every other class, we have a quiz or exam in her class, also, and while some may think it bothersome to study often, it keeps me up to date and alert in the content knowledge. I do find it frustrating that there are only 5 questions on her quizzes as the penalty is brutal for making one minor mistake, but they are helpful in staying alert, and they are only about 6 % in the entire class average.","He is so personable, and I really enjoy his class. My TA, [Removed], is incredibly helpful. She is AMAZING at her job, and I credit her with helping me get comfortable with college level biology.","Professor [Removed] is very kind, and I appreciate how welcoming she is to students who may be struggling with the content, and just students in general!","She doesn't stop to answer questions, now I understand we have TAS and a short time. I feel the class would be so much more enjoyable if she answered students questions during lectures.","I think professor [Removed] maintains a pretty professional relationship with her students during lecture. I'm unaware of what she is like during smaller settings like office hours because I have yet to attend one. I've attended her TA's office hours and they are competent and know what they're talking about!","I appreciated the reflection","The instructor is very kind and understanding. The teaching style however throws me off due to how what we learn in class does not correlate to what we do in lab as there is more that we are learning in lab with the short amount of time we have to complete the assignment.","Prof. [Removed] is excellent! Very organized course and teaches material in a way that is easy to understand. However, I feel like the grading criteria / requirements are not well outlined, which has resulted in loss of points on some assignments. I would appreciate having a rubric / grading outline for all / most assignments to prevent this problem.","He is very nice and i feel that that creates a positive learning environment. He is fun to listen to and his examples during class make a lot of sense and demonstrate concepts well. He is also great at explaining the material.","I like the way that my instructor has the class set up. I think that the learning modules that are required before class that cover what will be in the lecture help me learn a lot better. She also explains everything in common language and thoroughly enough so that it is easier to understand. She also provides many resources for studying when exams come up, and makes sure to prepare us for what is going to be on the exam and the question types.","I like my instructor!","My instructor tries to make it a fun environment in such a big class size. It can also make it difficult to cater to a lot of students, so there are many resources that are provided to help us succeed.","I like how she has quiz reflections that help us earn back points","Nope! But i love [Removed] and so grateful to have her","I wish the instructors were more active on [Removed] [Removed] I feel like I would post my homework questions there if I knew it would get responded to in a couple hours, but I understand Dr. [Removed] and the TAs have other classes, research, and personal lives and can't constantly tend to [Removed] discussion. It's just really frustrating to go approach a homework problem 4 different ways and it still be wrong and not know what to do.","he has a very strong accent so I can't understand him well","The instructor is a great speaker with incredible charm.","I enjoy that Dr. [Removed] cares about the people we are outside of the physics classroom. I've heard from other students how even though they don't particularly enjoy physics, they enjoy having Dr. [Removed] as a professor. I enjoy physics as a course and also enjoy Dr. [Removed] as a professor because of his focus on who we are, what goals we have, and what we value in our personal lives. He understands that physics is not exactly what gets us all out of bed in the morning and can connect with us on other levels.","I like that my instructor uses relevant examples to our fields of study and interests.","Mrs. [Removed] moves too fast and does not always go in depth about what is being taught. I often leave her lectures confused.","He gives half point back to missed questions on midterms, which encourages us to learn our mistakes topics again ; I like it","Dr. [Removed] seems to genuinely care about students.   It does become slightly frustrating that it feels like the end of our class time is rushed because of time / classroom management.","Not that I can think of. She seems like a good instructor and I appreciate her!","i really like Dr. [Removed] she is very kind and informative and explains material well.","This is my first time taking physics. I have never taking physics in highschool prior to this semester. This course is difficult but I believe the support that Dr. [Removed] provides is crucial for a student who found this course challenging like me. She make my experience with this course feel much better and I hope I can improve my learning and understanding of physics after the course finished.","I am really enjoying this class, and hope to see what the future leads to!","[Removed] is a wonderful instructor and she creates a welcoming environment for her students. I wish there were more practice worksheets with answers available. She's usually very engaged with her student but the 3 pm class has me [Removed]","Dr. [Removed] often gets frustrated in class when TA's answer student questions. However, the questions students ask are very important and most people rely on TA's to answer these questions because Dr. [Removed] won't. She also stops class often and gets distracted by students whispering. The constant stopping in class usually leads to us not having enough time to finish quizzes or slide presentations.","Have not attended office hours so do not know about this.","He is just really energetic and he seems to enjoy what he is teaching and wants everyone to see how energy electrons and magnetism really applies to the real world that he does demonstrations in classes that are amazing","The addition of captions might be helpful in understanding what is being said in class.","I would say that in general the instructor is very eager to help us learn and creates many opportunities for help if we don't understand something in class.","I have nothing else to share! I highly enjoy the dynamic of this class compared to most of the other STEM courses I have taken here at [Removed]!","It is my opinion that Dr. [Removed] has spent too much time trying to shush students in class when they are speaking while they are not supposed to be. I agree with her in that their whispering and sometimes complete just talking is distracting, but I also think that as a professor she should of all people be able to tune it out to focus on the lesson. She has said that my class ( 11 - 12:15 ) has missed out on multiple insights for the tests that the other 2 classes have recieved because she spends so much time having to stop and ask people to quiet down. I can appreciate the first couple of times, but she has easily made the comment 10 + times a lecture and I find myself frustrated not only with the people talking, but her for bringing it up so often instead of going through the lecture. I am fully aware that talking is incredibly disrespectful to her and the rest of the students, but I'd like to say again that in my opinion she needs to spend less time focusing so much on it to just continue teaching so that the rest of us can learn as best as possible.","He gives us extra credits. This makes the course experience more positive.","The class moves really fast, but the professor is really nice","She was able to share her own experiences and mistakes which helped us to understand that everyone makes mistakes so we don't have to stress too much about how we messed up.","Dr. [Removed] is seriously one of the best instructors I've had. He makes learning physics fun but what I like the most about him is how down - to - earth and helpful he is.","I really enjoy my experience with my instructor. She is very approachable and has made the lab an enjoyable and educational experience. I continue to learn so much from her, such as how to be a good student and leaner. Props to [Removed], she is amazing!","Dr [Removed] is super nice and sweet as a professor but his course is super challenging","I enjoy Dr. [Removed]'s class. She is very accommodating and helps us understand the material.","Dr. [Removed] always tells her students about opportunities outside of academia- this includes orchestra concerts, food truck locations, and so much more! Dr. [Removed] truly reminds students that she is also a human and relates to us, whenever I speak to her I just know that I am accepted and appreciated.","I think the instructors should offer points back on the quizzes, or cut down the amount of questions. There are many questions, a large portion of which are memorization based. For the first quiz, we were asked about the number of related deaths / illnesses in 2019. I do not understand the point of asking such a question. 2019 is not the most recent year, so why 2019 specfiically? Additionally, what is the point of memorizing such a fact? will this be usable in our future career knowledge? How often do adults discuss this on a daily basis? I feel that memorization questions are unfair. Asking more practical questions makes sense, such as [Removed] procedures, or the proper methods in subculturing plates, etc. These are questions that we will apply in the lab. The quizzes are very frustrating, and add a stress factor from the extremely large bank. Additionally, last year's class did not have to take quizzes. There is also no opportunity to earn points back. To improve, I think you should eliminate the quizzes like last year, reduce the number of questions, give the chance to earn points back, or allow the option of collaborating such as group quizzes. In other labs, you work with peers and fellow researchers to accomplish a goal, this should not be too different. The quiz aspect of this class should have improvement","Dr. [Removed] seems to genuinely enjoy lecturing and helping students understand the material.   He's a very engaging lecturer and super helpful during office hours.   I actually enjoy going to lecture and learning the material, which is saying a lot because I used to hate physics.   I'm hoping he teaches the next series of physics classes so I can sign up for another one of his courses.","No i think I have discussed it all.","She's been a great professor who cares a lot about her students' progress.","I am thankful we are encouraged to participate in class activities and instapolls to start applying about the material learned in lecture as soon as possible. This helps get a grasp on information better, or clarifies the material before trying to apply it to concepts in exams.","I don't think so.","She does a lot of good practice examples with us that usually appear in quizzes and examns.","I really like how the instructor has office hours that allow me to get additional help that I need. When I went, there were few students, and she would come to me making sure that I had all my questions answered. She would also frequently check up on me to ensure I was on the right track. I really appreciated how helpful she was.","There is nothing else I would like to share.","The showing of images before every lecture whether it is a recent discovery or part of his own research is such a small detail that makes every lecture better. Takes some stress off and helps us realize that we're all important to achieving evolution as a species and that anyone can do it.","I feel like he approaches physics with the mindset that anyone can learn it. I really appreciate that. I feel like it can be really easy to get discouraged if you do not get something and everyone around you does. I like that he still tries his best to push everyone.","For me I think the fact that the professor is open to students making mistakes and helping us overcome those struggles has been refreshing. He is very helpful in office hours","The instructor is very kind and tries to make sure we grasp the fundamentals of difficult concepts during class. I appreciate how she offers her office hours and encourages us to ask questions without judgement.","No, that is all.","The instructor did a great job at teaching chem and being helpful.","This lab, along with its TA's make the environment stress free and a wonderful time. I feel like [Removed] and [Removed] make the naturally stale and monotone lab environment a fun and meaningful experience. I think that if more lab TA's were as laid back and open to mistakes as [Removed] and [Removed] are labs would be a much better overall experience.","She is very empathetic and humble. She is extremely relatable and kind.","Sometimes I'm not sure what exactly I'm meant to learn in the class. Our instructor sets up learning modules, which she says are only meant to pique interest for the lecture, yet I learn more material from these than from the lecture. In these learning modules, there also are many links to outside sources, and it is unclear how far I should dive into each topic ( what is necessary, what is optional ).","I enjoy the personal stories and encouragement you share at the beginning of lectures.","She is very engaging and approachable.","The instructor may not be clear and sometimes have a hard undertstanding but the TAs are resourceful","dr [Removed] [Removed] is an amazing professor.   I feel respected, welcomed, and confident in my abilities in his class.","He made sure there were lots of options we could take to study the material.","He is very welcoming and open to asking questions.","I like how Dr. [Removed] is open to answer as many questions she can in class, and after the class ends she always encourages people to come to her office hours if they need help.","I think she reads off the slides during her lectures but does a good job with examples.","Professor [Removed] took some time at the end of a class to talk about how some of us may feel that we don't belong at [Removed], but that nobody is perfect at everything the first time they try it, and that we are all at [Removed] for a reason. I thought that was very kind and helpful.","I love the practice tests and condensed topics list that all [Removed] students have access to. It allows me to study with my roommate who has [Removed] as a TIPS scholar. Although we have different professors, I think its neat that every [Removed] can all study the same content and help each other out. Please more practice problems and test - centered strategy tips! \n\n Dr. [Removed] is inoffensive and she effectively lectures and provides materials for us to be successful.","Her classes are very good and have a good pace, in the sense that they are not to fast neither monotonous. I'd recommend her to anyone interested in the course.","I like how Dr. [Removed] offers a variety of ways to study for the test, including the square caps and discussion section worksheets.","My instructor is very kind, understanding, and super helpful. I really enjoy being in her section.","I think that the instructor is really good and wants the students to succeed in class.","Barely any professors do this, but Dr. [Removed] talking about her life experiences and struggles really makes her approachable and relatable. I believe many teaching individuals underestimate this skill. Dr. [Removed] does bring random life events. The life events she talks about is to either reassure or motivate us. This has made it less stressful to learn physics. Also she is incredibly positive and optimistic. This aspect of her is very contagious and that is a good thing.","She's pretty great. \n","The course encompasses so much. Going by the textbook, it is a chapter a week. This means that sometimes people can get left behind if they don't rapidly intake new knowledge. It feels compressed.","None that stand out to me","When discussing questions about exams she is not as accommodating. Some questions I believe were unfair or not necessarily taught which I thought was not helpful or an accurate measure of mastering the content.","Overall, I think this course is accessible and informative. Dr. [Removed] is quite approachable and offers many resources and non - required opportunities for students to improve their understanding of physics. She acknowledges the many difficulties that students face in their studies while encouraging them in overcoming them and offering strategies therein.","Not really ; good guy, just kinda someone who goes through the material fast. But I guess that's college.","One difficulty with this course is that some of the information we need for the homework isn't given until Friday, which only leaves one day to actually do those problems on the homework.","I appreciate the amount of examples and resources provided, especially with the question types and unit review notes!","Dr. [Removed] is very kind and a good listener. He works hard to make sure his students do not fall behind and are actually understanding the material, rather than just memorizing it.","I feel like he makes the class welcoming to everyone — although I'm not the type of student to ask questions during lecture in front of the whole class, I'm not scared to go ask him something after class, which is different from a lot of other physics classes that I've taken in the past. He really wants students to learn and it's shown through his teaching and grading style : he encourages discussion a lot, and his homeworks and exams' policy leave room for learning and understanding of the subject.","Dr. [Removed] is very helpful and willing to work with students, which is something very important. He goes beyond to offer students better opportunities and is willing to help students find what works for them. The course is overall designed for you to apply concepts constantly so you are not forgetting previous concepts which helps students retain information thoroughly. Also the teacher's assistants and Dr. [Removed] are very helpful in class when it comes to answering questions and clearing confusion.","I think this course is great with Loveridge, but I do understand that [Removed] in general is a very rigorous topic in general ; overall I do wish that the midterms were I bit more less challenging in the terms of the content of the midterm, such as the clock problem. But overall the current system is great for those taking engineering physics.","By encouraging us to talk with students next to us, as a freshman who might feel awkward with the university, we have chance to make friends. Also, by discussing what the answer will be, by explaining to each other, we have chance to study deeply.","Dr. [Removed] is very understanding and willing to help students who are struggling in class. Although the class can be difficult, he does not make it unnecessarily difficult on purpose and only wants to see his students learn and succeed.","The instructor is fine. I wish she would kick people out of the class that whispered though, cause that's a real problem.","Dr. [Removed]'s method of teaching through problems is really helpful as it allows classmates to clarify concepts with one another further strengthening our understanding.","Dr. [Removed] is an excellent professor he just moves very quickly.","Dr. [Removed] is very kind and welcoming which I appreciate because college can sometimes be stressful and having a kind and understanding professor can make or break your experience. He makes learning engaging and fun. I really enjoy having him as my teacher this semester.","I thought that the instructors were incredibly helpful when it came to making the students feel understood and engaged in class.","she is a really good in teaching and provide us with insides on how to do well on the test. i am really happy to be her student","They gave us lots of practice that was similar to the test and that helped me prepare.","I like that she does the muddiest point analysis because it is really helpful that she re - teaches those harder topics on a deeper level.","She is a very nice instructor who encourages group work and hands - on learning!","She encourages us to keep learning and keep our eagerness to learn about chemistry going. She reiterates mistakes on exams although feel devastating are ok, and normal. She encourages us to utilize re - take opportunities and try for better results. She encourages us to prove to ourselves that we can do it.","So far, I love Professor [Removed]'s class! I used to hate chemistry in high school, but her class has been really fun as she teaches the concepts really well. The learning modules are super helpful too!","I think she's great but she moves too fast","I think the instructor goes a little too fast, but I understand that this is supposed to be a fast - paced course.","I appreciated how respectful my instructor was.","I believe that my lab instructor, [Removed] creates a really comfortable environment where everyone is not intimidated to ask questions or answer questions. I appreciate their efforts to help us with our experiments and make sure everything goes smoothly. I also really appreciate them created a shared playlist everyone can add to, to play in the background of the lab","Sometimes the content is covered too quickly but the resources make it easier to cover outside of class.","I really like this class. I think the professor is great. I do know that sometimes the energy in the class is low because the class is at 9:30 am and a lot of kids are tired. I do like how the professor still tires to interact with the class and keep the energy levels up despite the circumstances.","I do not feel that this is necessary for a chemistry course, there is not a lot of other historical context that is delved into due to most important chemistry discoveries being held by white men.","This instructor has been amazing with answering to our curiosity on the things that we observe in lab. She is always prepared to push our thinking and help us along the way. She is also very understanding of our personal lives and provides support to us in any way needed. She is able to adapt to any situations occurring.","The chemistry professors met together to discuss questions on our last exam that they felt were unclear. They gave students points back on those questions.","My instructor has been great! I think we all feel adequately prepared for our labs, and she's very knowledgeable and willing to help us if we're stuck.","He gives good examples that directly correlate with the homework on [Removed]. This makes the homeworks so much more manageable.","i love the way the new chemistry classes have been formatted.","She is a very good professor that obviously cares about her students' success.","the professor also offers one on ones after midterms which is very helpful.","Nope, thank - you.","I really like this course and it makes me feel like I'm contributing to something big","Professor [Removed] does a great job creating a light environment.","I appreciate how she handled my accommodations through [Removed], i have a hard time talking to professors about it and she treated it very kindly but still casual. When talking to professors about accommodations, my two worst case scenarios are if they don't care / don't believe I need my accommodations or if they are overly accommodating and treat it like a big deal. She was very kind without making our conversation a bigger deal than it needed to be.","I would rather figure out the results of my exam scores on my own rather than being called out for having a low score on an inbox message. I understand that the instructor was probably doing this out of consideration to better improve myself, but I did not take it light heartedly. Nevertheless, I do appreciate the reminder of going to office hours.","The instructor simply never talked about that sort of positivity.","Very great professor and very helpful and knowledgeable","She is a great professor.","She is an awesome professor and very vulnerable which is so important to see as a college student","I went to office house to ask about a missed question on a test and my professor explained and then praised me about my grade overall.","He is good at breaking down problems and answering questions after class","She is very welcoming and makes a notoriously difficult course seem more doable, so I really appreciate the efforts she puts in doing that.","Dr. [Removed] is very nice and good at breaking down the information in an easy to understand way.","No! She is wonderful","I think the instructor does a good job of staying on track and covering the course material well. I think she can improve on her way of teaching the course. She could add more activities and experiences to demonstrate in class.","I think his lectures are too fast paced to retain enough information. However, the TA led discussions are helpful.","I think if the instructor was a little more clear about what we are going to be learning for the week before just diving straight into the content, less students would be confused when we are bombarded with information.","Dr. [Removed] is very friendly and open to discussion, which is something that I think helps the students feel comfortable in his classroom and have more of an openness to learn.","It's sometimes hard to follow along with the lectures since my professor often underlines words but it's hard to connect them together.","Dr. [Removed] is very caring and understanding. She emphasizes mental health and provides a safe environment to learn physics.","She is a really good biology instructor and I enjoy her teaching style and how her class is organized and I do feel confident in the material that she teaches, but based on the last response, I realized that I don't know that much about her as a person and professor, which would be really interesting and inspiring to hear about, but none of my other professors other than my [Removed] [Removed] professor seemed to have time to say that much yet either.","I reccomend taking more questions out of the textbook and explaining what sections would be most useful for the next lecture so students can get another chance to understand the material. Besides that, it's good to always encourage discussion and have students answer each other's question so they can flex their knowledge regarding the question or subject.","I think so far in my academic journey, Professor [Removed] course policies are the best. There are few difficult things for me that I would like to be addressed. For example, I'm a commuter student. I drive from 1hr everyday to get to campus. I wish If there was way for me to still participate in the class without having to show up to campus every day because frankly its very tiring to drive every day for an hour to get to campus. Perhaps lectures online or online zoom availability for commuting students can be a great thing.","I really like this class, and I love how the class is structured. It is easier for me to focus with the smaller class size and all the grading is fair so far. The only recommendation that I would give is to give us more practice problems throughout the weeks leading up to the exam, so we can all feel more prepared for tests.","She is an amazing instructor who keeps students involved and makes learning fun. She encourages students to give it their all and always ask questions if needed. She has no problem going back to review or repeat information and provides an enormous amount of support to ensure that all students feel comfortable in the course.","He is truly incredible and structures the course incredibly well!","He is a nice guy.","I wish she could slow down her teaching and make it more visually understandable.","She is very caring and knowledgeable. She cares about students and wants them to succeed in her class. She's happy to answer the questions that we may still have after class, and she emphasizes the growth mindset and discussion with peers to talk about the problems before going over in class together.","I would love to be able to have an opportunity for test corrections. While it would help my grade, it would also allow me to learn from my mistakes rather than just moving to the next unit.","She is very nice and has a lot of resources for students who need extra practice for the exams or just over content.   This is very important for students because she even provides practice exams that are harder than the actual exam that makes students feel more comfortable and ready for the exam.   Only critique would be the learning modules, I would just like an announcement that there are more than usual learning modules to complete and when they are posted since some are posted later than expected.","I think that this was not done because there is a little bit of a curve in her grading method regarding the exam ; however, she mentions that we can use our first exam ( in this case, since we barely took our first one ) as a way to assess our study strategies, which can help in the future.","I love how Professor [Removed] creates an environment where I feel comfortable to ask as many questions as I need to in order to understand a concept.","Exam was not fun.","I really like how many resources are available to her students and how she always makes sure there is a way students can personalize their studying based on what is most challenging to them. The question types, review and lecture slides, and practice problems / exam are very helpful.","I want this course to have better slides and lecture material as most of the course is self - guided. I would also appreciate it if the textbook was revised as there are so many mistakes in it and for the price that it is sold to students it is horrendous that that quality is what we are receiving. The textbook needs to be better written and have quality content rather than confusing students with the lack of cohesiveness. The most helpful things in this class have been my TA and his notes as they prepare me for the exams as the Professor does not release practice tests or ways to study for the exam.","I enjoy this course, but it is a hard course.","She is a great professor, I don't blame her for anything she does because it is a lecture hall with 400 students, it's impossible to please everybody.","Dr. [Removed] is amazing. She is one if not the most caring professors I have had at [Removed]","He goes pretty fast in class so it really helps to pre read using the textbook.","Dr. [Removed] is a wonderful professor, and I really feel supported in the course.","I just believe that for a difficult class, she tries her best to make students actually learn and essentially relieve their stress. Her grading policies are nice as well as her study sessions.","The instructor is very specific with the content she lectures about. There is a formal structure to how to both her lectures and the study materials she posts for us. This made me feel more prepared to master the content of each unit.","focused on just class material which is good","One thing that's bothered me is how assignments, even those that don't require prior knowledge, are not made available to complete at our convenience, but are opened at a fairly arbitrary point in the week. For example my lab is Monday at 9 am, so the prelab becomes available 48 hours beforehand on Saturday morning. This means even if I plan my time well, I have no choice but to complete it over the weekend, while other lab sections such as the Tuesday afternoon section have almost 2 full weekdays to complete it. This made me feel frustrated because it feels like our instructor doesn't value our time.","No, she is a great lab instructor.","This instructor takes a lot of time and care to thoroughly answer students' questions. On multiple occasions, he has looked into things between lectures in order to elaborate and better answer a question from the previous lecture. I think this is very helpful and makes the instructor very approachable.","Despite the multiple “ No ”'s to the previous questions, his lectures are still engaging. He does go a bit fast in order to cover enough material to complete homework. However, he is a much easier professor compared to my last semester.","Your willingness to improve based off of feedback is amazing!","No, just that sometimes it is hard to follow his though process when he is lecturing and the squarecaps being for accuracy feels unfair because this is our first time seeing the material and we should be having to be able to apply the knowledge already cause we haven't even been given time to absorb the information.","I wish Dr. [Removed] spent more time sharing how concepts connect across the unit and across course content. During his lectures, he often just reads the slideshow which has minimal information on them to begin with. I feel like the lectures would be more beneficial if they followed closer to what would be asked on the squarecaps and exams.","more practice questions","Dr. [Removed] consistently brings a ton of passion and energy to class that makes me feel excited to be there and learn the course content. I'm a chem major so it'd be easy for me to just try and get through this class as painlessly as possible without really taking anything in but Dr. [Removed]'s passion for physics prevents me from falling into that trap. This especially come out when she's doing demos. She always seems super excited to show us the science in action, and you can really feel that energy rub off on the class. People laugh a lot more in that class than in any of my others and genuinely seem like they're having fun.","I wish practice tests were still provided, he used to. Other bio professors have their students getting above [Removed] on the tests yet our average was very low.","I like how he focuses on growth mindset and encourages it.","I like to discuss but it can be daunting in such a big class","The demonstrations and examples given in lecture are beneficial in helping me to connect the ideas and concepts that are taught in lecture to a real life experience. Furthermore, the questions given in lecture are challenging, yet provoke thought and allow me to reinforce the concepts that are being introduced","He's good at answering questions. If he doesn't know the answer of the top of his head, he'll research it and answer it in another class.","Overall, Professor [Removed] has been one of my favorite professors at [Removed] [Removed] so far. She is down to earth and seems to genuinely want to help us as much as she can. She also treats us all with mutual respect and even cracks jokes every now and then which lightens the mood a lot. This makes all the difference with such a rigorous class.","I think Dr. [Removed] is a really nice professor. he is approachable and I would feel comfortable expressing concerns to him and I feel like he would actually care and try to help the student. he seems to care about the material a lot but breaks it down nicely and doesn't overwhelm us too much.","The [Removed] course is sometimes hard to navigate and the learning modules are only posted days before they are due rather than in the beginning of the semester or in a calendar","I'd like to be more aware of what specifically students make mistakes with and how I can improve not making them.","I really like how thoughtful her responses to the [Removed] discussion posts are.","Since it is a physics class, there are various “ theoretical ” concepts that can be hard to understand on paper. At the first day of the course, Dr. [Removed] used an inclined plane with two figures(I think one was a sphere, and one was kind of two cones with bases attached together ) and showed how one rolled down while one went up, looking like it is going against gravity. He also had a wheel and rotated it held vertically, which didn't fall horizontally but stayed in its vertical position. This was very interesting to me personally and made me want to learn about the topics to see how those models are affected by it. \n I also really like that he is using actual physical models to demonstrate what we are going over. It is good to understand the concept and realize things that might not be so obvious, since most physical concepts are kind of “ invisible ” in bare eyes, which makes it a bit unintuitive I think.","This is not feedback for [Removed], who I have only nice things to say about, but rather for the course at large. \n\n Please be more respectful of our time. There are elements of this course that are by nature time consuming ( like lab work! ), and that is perfectly fine. However, the way in which lab photos are processed ( free form on a document ), all of [Removed] ( which you should know, totally incentives gaming the system rather than criticall thinking ), and the way that labs must stop and go together makes most students spend a lot of \" rote \" time in what is billed as a two hour course. Nobody likes to do that, and that constant disregard for brevity makes what should be an interesting course feel not enjoyable.","I really like her and the layout of the class. I wish we had more practice problems during class","I really like how the instructor does her best to be understanding of students and offer encouragement. I think it creates a positive learning environment that fosters success.","She alwasy seems to say for everyone to stop the whispering and how its a distraction however I never hear any whispering and her repeating for it to stop is more of a distraction and we tend to move slower. It seems like she is more bothered by it than anyone else in the class.","The class itself is very challenging and I am doing much better than I thought that I would have been, but the class is extremely fast paced and I feel that I am falling behind no matter what. We only had five classes between exam 1 and exam 2, which is hard for me to understand what I had gotten wrong in the last exam and prepare for the next upcoming one. So there is a sense of being overwhelmed in that class.","We do plenty of practice within the lecture time, but I wish she provided more out - of - class practice materials rather than just practice exams.","No I love the TA we have, ryan, he is very informative and allows better understanding on certain concepts when needed or simply just ask him. The area feels very open and not hostile to anything.","Breaking things down step - by - step helps to better digest the information while also feeling less overwhelmed!","Dr. [Removed] is a very funny man and I enjoy learning from him.","not in my personal experience","I feel this instructor has been very kind and understanding so far, as well as an effective teacher.","She did experiments for the class and explained why they did and didn't work. She also explained things through imagry which makes it much easier to visualize problems, especially in a class like this","No I don't have anything.","Everything is awesome.","I don't have anything else to add.","[Removed] is a great TA and is very patient","Sawyer is a great person who is very relatable and easy to talk to. She really cares about us and our projects, and she is willing to help no matter how long it takes. She is very knowledgeable in the course and has no issue helping us out at any point.","I feel as though the professor, other than the textbook, does not provide any material to review lectures before class, and often times the lectures don't have the same material as the textbook. I also feel like the material covered in class does not translate directly to the assignmentd we have to do, requiring more extra researching.","The instructor was always receptive to questions and always assured us that if we ever had any concerns, we should communicate them.","I think she is a great professor! She tries really hard to make sure everyone is comfortable with the material and tries to make the content fun and engaging. I never really thought I could understand physics, but she has given me the courage to try my best, and that caused me to get my first 100 on a physics exam. :)","My instructor has a policy this semester where instead of dropping our lowest exam score, we are instead allowed to take a retake exam ( not exactly the same as the first exam, but quite similar ) one week after the original exam, testing over the same concepts. Everyone is eligible for this retake exam.","I appreciate Professor [Removed]'s willingness to be forgiving on our tests, go slow during lessons, and to provide us with as much help as she can!","I really like Dr. [Removed]. She's by far the most approachable professor I've had. I struggle in coding, but she makes it feel like everyone is capable. She's open to different ideas and problem - solving skills. Dr. [Removed] is truly one of the best professors on campus.","This class is very supportive and I hope to do well and learn!","No! She is a great instructor.","Overall, the course has been challenging and engaging.","The grading distribution, percentage curve, and understanding of the professor makes the class so much better than if not!","No, that will be all.","Overall, [Removed] Hall is a good instructor. Some of this didn't really apply because this course is a lab course, and doesn't have lecture times for it either. So the only content that is important in this course is what we deduce at the end of each lab after experiments. The instructor is very helpful during class, and seems to enjoy being a lab instructor.","More resources or guided notes or study guides would be super helpful","Dr. [Removed] is a fantastic professor. She is one of, if not the best professor when it comes to answering and explaining questions, no matter how stupid it may be. She is very patient, thoughtful, and her organization skills do not go unnoticed as it helps me manage and understand the class very well.","No information at the moment.","I really like this course and feel like it's an effective and great way to get people more involved in research. However, there does seem to be a lot of busy work but I understand the point of most assignments.","Dr. [Removed] did some real life examples of the content in class that I felt gave a more intuitive approach to some of the content.","I really like Professor [Removed]'s positive attitude. She really seems to connect with us. I also like how much in - class practice she has us do, it's helpful.","She's a really nice professor, and speaks clearly. [Removed] is a bit fast but absolutely manageable if you've viewed toe modules before class as recommended.","I appreciate how approachable the instructor is and how he takes each inquiry into deep consideration. He doesn't ever make students feel stupid for asking questions, even if they may be simple.","I like that Prof. [Removed] explains the content very carefully and uses images and diagrams to deepen our understanding of the theory behind what we are learning.","She makes the class very engaging for all students.","She's very uplifting and asks students to talk to her if there are any issues and how she's willing to do what she can to help and support us. It honestly was refreshing to hear that since there are a lot of professors that don't particularly care about most situations, so it was a welcoming difference.","She does a great job!","I like the squarecap question polling during class. I find the problems at the beginning of class to be excitingly challenging, and I find the problems during class to be helpful in reinforcing the material of the class.","Really nice teacher! It isn't a class for opinions so I felt weird answering questions about like opinionated subjects as this is a biology class.","When the class begins I feel we are there to learn, as in listening to her talk about the material, and that's it. When she hears any kind of whispering she says come on guys let's come back I don't have the energy for this or my throat is not up for the whispering guys. Most of the time when she says this I can't hear the whispers she is referring to and it kind of makes me feel like we can't talk about anything at all or she will get mad.","She will ask the TA's to NOT answer question while she lectures. Then why are they there!???","Dr. [Removed] is very friendly and professional. He once offered a cough drop to a student who was coughing loudly, and he makes little jokes every now and then. It really improves the climate of the class","Not really, I don't have anything. Dr. [Removed] is a good professor once a freshman gets accumlated to college coursework. It may seem challenging, but Dr. [Removed] and her team really prepare everyone for the exams.","She has seemed so caring and supportive throughout the past month and definitely emphasizes the importance of mental health and sleep which has made me feel like she genuinely cares and sees me as more than a student!"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>instructor_id<\/th>\n      <th>coursegroup_id<\/th>\n      <th>or.course_additional<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"instructor_id","targets":1},{"name":"coursegroup_id","targets":2},{"name":"or.course_additional","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

They are also learning fundamental lab techniques like [Removed] and microscopy.

I talked them through my mindset during races.    \" I actively remind myself during the race about remembering how hard the course is and how my body if feeling in the moment.

Students examine the soil bacteria they isolate from their soil sample to look for evidence of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic production.   Students calculate the percentage of isolates that are resistant to two different antibiotics and the percentage of isolates that produce antibiotics.   Students conduct other biochemical assays as well to learn more about their soil isolates. At the end of the semester, students present their results to the class using a Research Poster.   I give them instructions for making these calculations and for presenting their in a poster.","All of circuits, magnetism, [Removed], [Removed] waves have good applications, \n filters / tuners, motors / generators, sensors, antennas...","I haven't said this explicitly but I probably should","[Removed] [Removed] carries an Ethics Flag, so I give students many opportunities over the course of the semester to discuss controversial issues.   Many times, that leads to students sharing their personal values.   Students have these discussions using [Removed], an social learning app.   Using this app, they read assigned articles, watch videos, and then answer prompts ( which I've written ) as well as comment on the issue.","After midterm2 when I showed the results and the class distribution I emphasized that students should be proud of themselves for how they are doing so far and encouraged them to keep the momentum going through the rest of the semester.","Send an email to students who did poorly on their first midterm exam. \n I already did it in one course. I'll do the same with two other class sections of another course after their grades are released. \n I know you can improve and grow with effort no matter how you did on this exam. This is just one snapshot of your performance in this class, but we need to have the right strategies moving forward.","Each day in my large lecture course, students receive 1 - 3 questions where they work with their neighbors and Learning Assistants to interpret and solve the problem. Its an essential component of learning in my introductory courses.","Between the two [Removed] surveys, I told students I first thought how it would replace my mid semester survey, but that it did not quite meet those expectations, e.g. I did not have feedback on my start - stop - continue questions. \n\n Therefore I launched my usual mid - semester feedback survey. \n I analyzed the resulsts and shared those with them. \n I specifically looked at the start - stop - continue answer, listed them, tallied them and responded in groups of suggestions : \n - policies / practices that are already in place, but students might have missed ( e.g. leniency in [Removed] grade ) \n - policies / practices that I immediately implemented ( e.g. practice exams without the key visible ) \n - policies / practices that seem good, but can not be implemented due to too many demands on our class time ( e.g. practice exams explained in class ) \n - policies   / practices that I can not implement in the same semester due to syllabus statements or pedagogical reasons. ( e.g. different exam policies ) \n\n I shared the survey results and analysis with students in an announcement and pointed out some changes at the beginning of class.","The TAs give their input to students about how they have done will in classes and what they have needed to do to change their grades.","Assigning a group project to collaborate with their peers to learn about a career they are interested in and talk to someone about the same to submit a report.","Using real - life examples","Lots of talking to each other, at many points in class ( and before / after ).","I have polling questions in every class. \n I provide the correct answer and address misconceptions as they arise ( from poll histograms )","Utilizing office hour in order to engage and encourage students to work in small groups","As we start analyzing messy data, I will discuss different approaches to analyze the same data, addressing any decisions that may impact data ethics. It is very important to recognize our own biases.","When appropriate, I will talk about my research as a grad student at [Removed].   I recently told a group' When I was grad student, my advisor told me that 50 % of my experiments would fail for some reason or another. I spent a year trying to infect a plant with a fungus and never succeeded in making that happen.'   I don't always say this to student groups- just those students who seem frustrated when they are having issues growing their bacteria.","Will discuss my sports and my [Removed] favorites. \n\n\n If there were 3 items, I'd fill in when, words, but for 14, c'm on!","This is what we do everyday in class and for every assignment!","I have an entire class devoted to exploring career pathways in [Removed] and beyond and will do a mindset matters values activity that week.","Besides the [Removed] survey, I will also ask students to complete a midterm survey to collect information about how they currently feel about the course, what aspects helped them learn so far, if they have any suggestions for improving the course this semester, and what they could do themselves to better succeed in this course ( still plenty of time for improvement! ).","Values writing activity before we discussed career exploration.","We discuss the process of learning, have pre - class questions that attempt to highlight growth, use growth mindset language, etc.","I do this in class when I am encouraging reticent students to participate in answering and asking questions","I am doing value based activities last week and then later in the semester.    We also have a whole class on mental health.","I consistently encourage students to give me feedback, but the specific instance was with their first midterm exam. Students discussed with me what they did for a particular problem and through that dialogue I was able to recognize a number of ways that the question could have been misinterpreted. I adjusted the points for that particular question based on student feedback and I mentioned to the class that was very helpful that they talked to me about the question.","I have made examples in lecture more explicit and centered around answering a research question using real data.","We are going to use [Removed] to play a game about what courses are required for degrees and what majors there are in [Removed].","This seems like a good point to add in the post [Removed] debrief to ensure I include a positive aspect   to that process. \n\n Along the lines of \" This is a challenging course and you as a class have learned a significant amount of material in a short time period and should be proud of yourselves for your accomplishments so far. Make sure to take a moment to reflect on what is working well in your study strategies and commit to building on those habits as we enter the final stretch of the course. \"","There is language in the syllabus and in my welcome announcements stating that I believe this. There are statements in the syllabus, and discussion in the class, about how in previous semesters essentially all students who have made use of the provided opportunities in the class / engage fully with the class have gotten the grades they hoped for regardless of starting points or setbacks to emphasize this point. There are many opportunities in the class for students to earn missed points back by doing additional / replacement assignments.","In my courses there is a major collaborative project that is pursued through scaffolding assignments. I mention in each assignment what learning outcome the assignment will help them tackle.","In my notecard assignment and in the first week, I required students to get to know each other and find things in common. I encourage / allow students to work in groups on assignments.","We continue to emphasize access to office hours and similar resources with considerable effort from the LAs to provide both office hours and study review sessions. Course extra credit is offered to encourage attendance and we will continue to emphasize these opportunities through the remainder of the course","I have students turn and talk to their neighbors regularly throughout class to discuss narrow specific questions. They also engage in active learning around primarily conceptual problems 1 - 3 times per 50 minute lecture.","I do this in different ways : \n\n - group assignments ( every week ) + peer feedback on group work ( coming up next week ) \n - review sessions where students collaborate on a [Removed] handout prior to exams ( week 4, 8 and 14 ) \n\n","When students reach out via email and/or in - person that something has happened, preventing them from attending class, taking an in - class quiz, or showing up for an exam, I work with a main TA to help convey next available steps. We have an email template, and I provide a time between the last class and the final exam to make up class exams if University - approved documentation is received. There are also a number of in - class polling and quiz drops to help account for students' life circumstances.","During class, if a particular topic was explained, but I knew it was more challenging, I would emphasize the importance of office hours for more individualized instruction. It can be difficult to assess if such a large group of students is understanding each topic, and it's usually mixed. I've stated during class, as much as felt natural, that I would love to talk to them more in my office hours.","I have talked about difficulties I had as an undergraduate in first - semester mechanics, and in the syllabus ( and a linked video ) I talk about difficulties I had in grad school.","Usually I talk to the students before class begins, like how was their weekends, what is their favorite movie / music, what is their major/ what topic interest them the most","In my syllabus there is explicit text on how I handle missed / late work due to emergencies. I also individually check with students that have missed significant assignments. \n I usually ask them if everything is going well and that I am concerned about them.","I have a some check - in questions where students reflect on their learning strategies","At the end of each week of lab, students are asked to interpret results from experiments and provide an explanation for the results they recorded during the week.   Here is an example question on their 11 - 8 Research Report Assignment on [Removed] : \n\n Where your results expected or unexpected?   Why?   What do these results tell you about the bacteria in your soil sample?","This semester I will be showing a few videos of people talking about how they learned from their mistakes. I also state this during class from time to time. When discussing a problem solving strategy I talk to students about how they may make mistakes when approaching a certain problem, but that is a valuable learning experience that will help them later in solving future problems.","We connect students with campus resources. They are encouraged to connect with mentors so that they can ask questions about college or their related field.","I'm teaching two pedagogy courses so reflection on personal learning goes hand - in - hand with the course content.","We shared with students that they need to apply situations to things and topics that they may not have covered, especially at students studying different areas. We let them know this often in class through their introduction to educational topics.","When we talk about career exploration, I talk about how I have encountered people in these professions.    I also talk about my own personal experience working.    I do this when there is a time in class, but we did have a class all about career pathways.","After exams, and this time in class after the second exam, gave directions to students on how to evaluate if their learning methods were effective.","In every class, there were a few times I asked the students to work on a problem with their neighbors.   Occasionally I'd say the best way to learn is from your friends.","I will briefly share my interests in music in the well - being message sent on [Removed]. \n The week of Oct. 13th \n Our interests and hobbies can help us endure challenging times and value our uniqueness. \n","When we release the first quiz grades, I will spend time in class showing students the most frequently missed questions.","Retest for Exam 2 ( since fits survey ). \n Did it on October 21. \n \" Exam 2 score will be replaced by Exam [Removed] score if it is better. \"","Ask [Removed] questions about the content \n In each class \n Say the question on the slide as is or rephrase the question","Students always had the opportunity to provide feedback, through office hours and being open and inviting during class.","There are many opportunities in the course : students complete lab assignments in groups that I assigned at the beginning of the semester, students work in groups to complete quick exercises during lecture, students can choose to work on a research project either independently or collaboratively.","I have a retake exam for every exam \n In - class quiz question provides 90 % credit for participation \n Homework assignment has one free try","I emphasize this after every midterm and often after unit quizzes.   I also talk about this in the review sessions that happen before midterms.","I'm actually not sure on how to do this in my course. I provide worksheets to complete with code during lectures and I also release a key at the end of a week. I just wish I had good advice for the students to keep track of all of the R functions we learn in this course. I'm attending a webinar in October that should help on how to improve note taking for data science students in particular.","We talk about learning strategies.    TA reach out to students who have missed the class to help them make up the attendance.","We made an effort to share that challenges will come up throughout the semester. We made sure to share positive thoughts at crucial times and share reaffirming messaging.","I have several contingency policies in regard to students missing classes and homework discussed on the syllabus. I have also mentioned to students that I will work with them to schedule a make - up exam if they are sick on the day of a midterm exam.","After I showed students the results of Midterm 2, I had them think about why we do difficult things like solving complex physics problems. I thought it was important to take a moment to have students reflect ( and share with their neighbors ) a problem in the world that they would like to solve because it was personal to them. Then I had them think about the fact that many of the problems that they identified were in fact difficult problems to solve.","I use a getting to know you activity at the beginning of the course that allows students to express their interests. They present this activity to their peers in discussion and I also get to read their responses and try to provide comments in their assignment. This semester, I have not been able to provide comments yet.","Students where asked to apply their lived experiences to all of the topics that we cover in class as well as assignments. We asked them to reflect, share, and explore their experiences as it relates to conversations in class.","We have let students know to reach out for late assignments or missed assignments. When this happen, students are not penalized for submitting assignments late if they reach out. Words that I have told students are : \" We are not here to penalize you and your grade.

Please reach out if you have to submit an assignment late and we can figure out what can be done in reopening assignments \".","The second [Removed] [Removed], and the final CIS.","Shared a belonging story about how I dropped out of law school because it wasn't a good fit for me.","[Removed], every single day, 1 - 4 times.","After the second midterm I spoke to students as burgeoning professionals who will have to solve problems, an essential skills developed in introductory physics courses.","I emphasize the course structure that includes Replacement Exams, vs. a cumulative final exam. Students can learn from their first time taking an exam on Unit 1 material, for example, and then replace that exam grade at the end of the semester. Students can learn from past mistakes and misconceptions, and conquer the Unit 1 material the second time around.","While ensuring I cover all the appropriate course material, I want to include real - world examples during class. For example, in Gas Laws coming up, there are a lot of applications, such as [Removed] diving and hot air balloons. I see this tactic as one where I can tie in student interests ( like pre - health majors ), as well. I will think on how the upcoming topics can tie to medicine.","When we talk about study stratigies we discuss working with classmates.    I openly ask the group if anyone wants to share things that work for them to share with the class.","I am using reflections on my content assessments to learn whether the resources available in the course are helpful for student learning and what else we can do to help their learning.","After each midterm I reach out to lower achieving students to identify potential barriers to learning and help them troubleshoot and make plans to improve their course outcomes.","I have consistently shared applications to my research or other research I am aware of. The first survey indicated that some students found this to be engaging and effective so I made a point of including several specific examples over the last few weeks, specifically a superconducting bearing and [Removed] circuits used as detectors. I typically walked through the application of the class amterial to the research along with visual aids.","Most of my classes do not have any individual timed assignments and my materials are accessible so the only way students usually use their accommodations is with flexible deadlines. I will make sure that they know they can submit their assignments a little later if that would improve the quality of the work they turn in.","The resources has been introduced on syllabus, reminding the students about them about mid - semester, using office hours to talk to students about the activities","Continue to tell stories about failure and improvement. \n [Removed] student's video how they mastered the physics course. \n LAs in class providing feedback. \n With email after the exam motivating students to make use of the re - take exam","While at the beginning of each lecture I try to connect the physics concepts that we are going to learn to real - world applications, from time to time during the course I also mention to students that they should think about the skills that they are learning in the course and how they may be able to use those skills to solve complex problems in the world.","I did an in class discussion about purpose where students discussed different kinds of purpose and tried to decide which ones applied to their work in this class. I very regularly give real - life or career related examples.","Literally sending them this survey.","I will provide a mid - semester survey to all of my students and discuss in class how I've used it in the past and what I will do when I read their responses.   I also share common themes during a following class that gives them an idea of what I gathered from their responses.   I will do this in a couple of weeks.","I use [Removed] booking for [Removed] students","We introduce the class to topics of diversity, as it relates to communities and educational systems. For example, they cover the [Removed] racial geography tour as well as take a community walk in the local schools in [Removed].","I've talked about inequities in high school background and I will do so in future","I will run a midsemester survey and I also occasionally do squarecap questions about aspects of the course.","Post an assignment on making concept maps and flow - charts to learn about biochemical pathways today to have them complete next week before exam 3.","Send another well - being message through [Removed]. \n The week of the 13th. \n Last time I mentioned the university resources like x, y, and z that can help you cope with life challenges. I want to make sure you receive the support you need and reach out to me if you need additional support from me. We will discuss options and find accommodations that can relieve your situation. Feel free to reach out to me.","I use [Removed] to gauge students' understanding of the material. I typically give students one or two questions per class and I show students the results ( in terms of a poll that shows the distribution of student responses ).","The grade in my class is attendance based.    We communicate with students at the beginning of the semester that if they miss a course they can meet with the TA to make up the class.    During the class that the student misses, the TA emails them to schedule a make up time to meet.","in some cases when the students have a situation which is not recognized as an emergency by [Removed] I am willing to offer help / accommodation","We asked students to share their personal stories and interest to explore their success after taking this course, specifically their educational trajectories and career experiences. We did this throughout the semester at different points.","During office hours I let the students and encourage them to answer each other questions","This was done already when presenting the theory of evolution by natural selection and talking about [Removed]'s experiences as a child, college student and husband.","Give a few minutes to think about a new problem before solving it with everyone \n Upcoming week \n I encourage you to think about this silently first before checking with your team. Then we'll solve it together.","After a new concept I pause to get questions from students. I discuss with them the answers of the In - class quiz questions. I have students providing me their answers.","Check - in question about students music interests. \n Quiz - questions about medical application of [Removed] concepts","Readings are mostly new to students, They are always applying knowledge that they have not covered in their reflections and other assignments. This happens on a weekly basis.","Students are hesitant to ask question, I usually encourage them to discuss it with their neighbors, talking to each other before sharing the question with rest of the class is very helpful to students","In the syllabus, in a linked video, in class","Since we are only at a third of the semester, there is still plenty of time for students to succeed. I will collect the information about what they feel they could improve on and will summarize what they said and share it with the class with my own advice as well.","Students were given a lot of feedback in their assignments in a way that wasn't punitive. Always in a way were they could share their ideas and feel like they can authentically share without feeling like it might impact their grade.","Students generally didn't do very well on Midterm 2, so I had students do a shorter ( new ) Midterm 2 a few days later for the opportunity to earn back half the points that they missed. I mentioned to students that we will do a retake instead of just curving the scores because what is important is the learning of the material, which they can demonstrate by doing another exam.","When conducting peer instruction, I allow several minutes ( or more ) for students to work together. I signal one minute left when about 75 - 80 % of students have answered. For impromptu questions, I estimate how long students need to discuss a specific question ( 20 - 90s ), allow for contributions, and usually pause for questions after a discussion.","some of our ice breakers talk about current professionals in STEM","I provide a link in my canvas home page with access to the different arrays of resources available at the university. This is also mentioned in my syllabus.","For every problem I do in class, we \" check the answer \" by trying to interpret the meaning of the answer. Sometimes I do it for them, sometimes I have the class provide answers. In office hours I make every student do this for every problem.","I would want to ensure students had enough background information. Then, I'd pose a more challenging type of problem or scenario they haven't seen explicitly yet in - class. They could discuss ways to solve the problem in small groups.","Students have handouts and polling questions in every class period where they work with each other to complete the handout. \n Sometimes there is silence at the start when they're thinking independently, but I always encourage them to check with their neighbors / peers /friends. \n\n","For example, today we were discussing specific forces like tension and the normal force, so to set up the discussion I showed students a video of the current record for skydiving as a way to get them to visualize forces that not only a skydiver experiences, but the forces that we experience in everyday life. During the lecture, I mentioned during two worked - out problems how doing the problem will help them figure out a real - world application in that they can calculate the forces involved when they may need to hang an object from their ceiling.","Using office hours to encourage them","I am doing three hings : \n 1. reading quizzes on [Removed] ( ungraded ) \n 2. polling questions in class \n 3. at the start of every week, I aks them what was the muddiest point from the previous week. I summarize theses ( with help of AI ) and provide a handout to students.","I always emphasize that making mistakes with the R code is actually a better way to learn the syntax and how specific we need to be. I regularly use common mistakes with the R code to also emphasize concepts ( for example, how we need to choose how to represent data depending on its type ).","When students are asked to complete the Course [Removed] [Removed], I send out an email encouraging them to fill out the survey.   I explain that I use this feedback to improve the student learning experience.","In some sense this survey is giving them an opportunity to provide feedback and is an important element of our initiative this semester. \n\n I would also like to add some targeted in class instapoll queries after the second midterm that can also provide an opportunity to get a sense of the state of the class.","All students had the experience to work with a peer outside of class at least once for the semester.","I sent a congratulations message to students after their second exam that showed significant improvement of many students. I also said one day in class that we have come a long way since the beginning of the semester and learned much about genetics. \n October \n My message : Most students improved, some by large and others by smaller, but any upward change is an improvement and an occasion to celebrate! Do not compare yourself to others but focus on your own progress. Do not get discouraged if you're not satisfied with your performance but feel free to see me or any TA.","Students work together the entire semester to design experiments and then analyze the data together.   They work together to create a Research Poster to present their findings to the class.","I have several policies that allow students some flexibility for when life events happen.   They are allowed to miss one lab without any explanation needed.   I drop the lowest grade for several assignments.   This is clearly explained in the syllabus.","We shared the opportunity to talk bout things that they didn't understand during office hours and class. Always ensuring students that the goal of learning topics was to relate it to their life, not to become experts.","We have weekly challenges that promote students to use campus resources.    There was an assignment during registration week that required a student use a campus resource and answer 4 questions about it.    I reminded them about the assignment every week in class to give them ample time to complete it.","Provide and encourage extra problem resources","Most days in class for my large intro course I try to highlight at least one real world aspect of the physics we are learning.

There will be options for group work during discussion sections, but student buy - in for this has been low. I talk about belonging and community.","I try to wait several seconds after asking questions during lecture and ask for students across different areas in the classroom to participate in the question answers.","We take students to the library so that they know how to use the [Removed] database for research. We connect them with [Removed] guidance as well as encourage them to attend writing support centers on campus.","At the beginning of the semester, I make a [Removed] math review available to students. That set of modules is optional, but it's a place where students can do a bit of practice to refresh their memory of prerequisite math concepts that will be used in this course.","using real life examples based on new materials","Focused on application of methods to answering real research questions based on their interests.   I've done this during lecture and on assignments.","Most assignments for this course are based on their educational experiences that have led them to this point in their lives as freshman at [Removed] [Removed]. They share their stories and the stories of their families as it relates to their education experience, while reflecting on frameworks that they received throughout this course. Ultimately, assignments focus on their personal and professional development as well as their career pathways.","Using instapolls during the class, pausing before and after solving an example in the class, constantly encouraging them to share their questions","I ensure students there are some built - in \" safety nets \" in the course. For example, they have three chances on each Learning Module, the lowest 33 % of in - class quizzes are dropped, and the use of Replacement Exams, instead of a a cumulative final exam, are used at the end of the semester. No one, single assignment needs to be a detriment to their final course grade.","By using instapoll during lectures students are able to practice the newly learned materials","Students just finished midterm 1.

These struggles can certainly impact how we perform academically, and it's important to recognize that. \n If you're unsure where things went wrong, I'd be happy to go over your exam with you. We can pinpoint areas to focus on for next time. \"","I not only mention to students the times that the instructional team is available throughout the week, but I make it clear that we are there to help them learn the material and that we are happy to help them.","I started the class by pointing to the very beginning of my syllabus where I go into how I believe that everyone can learn physics. I repeat this message from time to time in class where I state that students can be successful with work and a bit of time.","Since students are developing new skills, possibly in a topic where they are not interested in, they were told that the skillsets they were learning in class was to improve their overall experience at [Removed]. It was always presented as a benefiting of skills as the goal of the class.","I've added into my course a large variety of example datasets of things that hopefully are of interest to them.   When we learn a new analysis method, I tie it to answer real - world analysis questions.","In the upcoming units, I plan to show more graphs and experimental data to help the students think about the content in a different way. For example, graphs could help exemplify the relationship between pressure and volume, or volume and temperature, within the Gas Laws unit, better than merely looking at a formula.","Over the course of the entire semester, students work in group of 3 - 4 to design and conduct experiments using a soil sample collected from one of [Removed]'s Field Stations.","We have not had the opportunity yet to tackle this issue in [Removed] [Removed] in terms of mistakes I may have made when lecturing. I do tackle students' misconceptions weekly.","I use real - life ( nature, medical ) examples in my in - class quizzes","As we start digging into more challenging materials, I will have more time for students to think independently on how to use code to achieve what we want to get. After some independent thinking, I will ask them to share with a partner.","Pause my lecturing with practice problems students complete in small groups that they formed at the beginning of the semester.   I do this every class day, and the students expect it because these activities are labeled \" group practice \" or I have written on the slides \" complete the following in your group... \".","When we get a bit further on, I can use specific examples like teaching about sound using music examples.","I make time to remind students of services like the physics coaching tables, teaching team drop - in hours, and [Removed].

By recognizing your values and gifts, I hope you view your current challenges in the broader context of your life.","The whole course is centered on how students can conduct authentic, relevant research, and how their work contributes to the ongoing battle against antibiotic resistant bacteria.   This is discussed in the syllabus.   During the first week of lab, students read articles and watch videos that emphasize this.","I combine working independently to mean that students can work with their neighbors.

I specifically ask students to think to themselves sometimes before asking for a volunteer to answer","Almost in every topic I find it extremely helpful to use a real life example","Since last survey, there have been two new assignments where students have to chose their own topic aligned with their interest areas. \n\n They have been introduced to the two new assignments in week 9 of the semester. \n Because these are both group assignments, students were asked to brainstorm about both assignments in week 9 and record on paper their own interests, and then decide as a group, within the realm of possibilities for their assignment. \n\n The tricky part is that the assignments are aligned with learning outcomes as well, and therefore they can not just pick anything that they're interested in. \n\n [Removed] Note 2 is aligned with [Removed] related to biodiversity, so students are asked to compare biodiversity in e.g. space ( e.g. their hometowns, major cities,... ) or ime,   or within taxa that they're interested in. E.g. many biology students have an interest in pollinators or birds or reptiles etc. \n I did have to give some feedback to students hat their chosen topic did not address biodiversity. E.g. you can study biodiversity of birds, but not biodiversity of only grackles. That might have been perceived as a negative by some student groups. \n\n [Removed] Note 3 is aligned with the LOs of the course that relate to landscape ecology and conservation biology. Students were asked to pick a topic within this realm, but many suggestions were not at all within this realm. I also gave some advice and suggestions on this. Again, this might have been perceived as a negative by some student groups. \n\n","I plan to share with students that is nice to have a professional plan but realize that these plans can change and this is fine. \n I would like to do this in the coming weeks ( if time allows as this course is content heavy ) \n I am not sure yet which words I will use.","We have talked about [Removed] learning center and [Removed].    We will start to talk about course schedules and looking at degree progress   in the next few classes.","I employ zombie problems on my exams. This semester midterms have 13 questions over new material plus 3 questions that are similar to low performing questions from the prior midterm. Students who go back to learn the process have the opportunity to improve their subsequent midterm score through demonstrating their learning over old material in addition to new.","We give students activities and class discussions with opportunities for students to think and process. There are no right or wrong answers, and they do not get penalized if they don't participate nor receive extra points if they do.","Tutorials, links to other sites","At the beginning of lecture, I go around the classroom and ask students how their weekend was, what their plans are for the next weekend, check in if anyone went to the game, going to [Removed], also letting them know they should embrace the cool activities [Removed] has to offer!","I provided a introduction how important the survey to my teaching strategy is \n to foster belonging and growth mindset. \n I will have a second survey \n I have at each day of class a check - in question to get students feedback","I have been and plan to continue to include examples from my research, other relevant research, and the world around us of applications of the course material where possible to do so.","Invited students to participate in survey and providing extra credit / bonus","I use examples provided in the book. My goal is to incorporate current examples I see in social media but it has been difficult to do so this semester to have time to do so.","We have instapoll queries in most class sessions and will continue to do so. We use this as an opportunity for students to discuss amongst themselves as well as with the LAs and myself.","We do ice breakers at the beginning of almost all of our classes.    We discuss different study strategies and study groups.","I am not sure how I will approach this yet. For me the word meaningful is not as important. I would rather prioritize what they want to accomplish in the future while acknowledging that there are many different paths that can be followed.","Policy : contact me directly for additional acommodations","We talk about all of the different CNS majors in this course.   Specifically during our advising courses.","LA supported peer instruction using [Removed] to capture answers.","Welcome and share mistakes. \n In informal Q&amp;A \n Thank you for sharing your thoughts. While this is a common misconception, it reveals our thinking and helps us learn from our mistakes. I make similar mistakes as well.","I already incorporate many real - world examples into my materials with real datasets but I am teaching a new course that did not include much background information about the datasets. I will make sure to emphasize the context for students by adding descriptions and pictures for the datasets I will use in the upcoming lessons.","Show a graph of the number of mutations plotted against the parent's age \n Upcoming week \n I want you to look at this graph and think silently about the prompts shown before answering. \n","I'm focusing in two skills : \n 1. group work \n 2. data skills \n\n They have been working in roup and will be doing a peer evaluation later in the semester. \n They have just finished a data skill assignment and a next [Removed] is coming up in October. \n","I usually give students a few minutes to write down their thoughts or derivations before demonstrating it myself. I give i - clicker questions and ask students to discuss among themselves before asking for students to volunteer their answers.","When lecturing, I like to plan specific questions at the start of certain topics that I pose to the class before we learn the specific formula / method for solving them.   I believe I allow them enough time to think of their own answers before moving on.","Show how detecting and analyzing mutations are crucial for research and health \n Upcoming week ( learning about mutations ) \n By the end of class, I hope you recognize how detecting mutations is crucial to identifying potential carcinogens.","We will have the second midterm soon, I would like to run through the problems that students struggled with the most and work through them to identify common mistakes and how to avoid them in future exams and assignments.","I'm patient with Instapolls","This course is based on attendance so we focus on the students attending class.","Gave students time to complete a values writing activity before we discussed career exploration.   Pointed out how careers that align with one's values tend to be satisfying and that many people change careers or majors during college or during their lifetime.   Showed resources from [Removed] Career Services about the many careers that one can pursue with a science major and told personal story about the three different careers that I've experienced.","I am writing an email if I see that students are not participating in the in - class quizzes. \n And I encourage the students who have   a lower grade to reach out to me.","The students did a values based activity last week in class.    I am planning to do another values based activity later in the semester.","During lectures I connect the topics to life science applications. I mention to students how the basic physics that we are learning can be used to model more complex systems like the human body as most students in my classes are doing a degree in the life sciences.","We shared that their experiences brought them to [Removed] [Removed] for a reason. That they are capable of succeeding and that they will be successful post - first year of study. This encouragement was shared weekly and in [Removed] messaging.","This is a good idea I need to think about how to do in basic physics but I will try","By sending reminders about scheduled office hours / TA and LA help sessions and repeating it once in 2 weeks at least to make sure they are aware, also emphasizing on availability outside of those scheduled times in case it has conflict with their schedule","Historical references, e.g. [Removed] confronting his high school teachers with a new idea ( already discussed 10/1 ), or [Removed] seeing a contradiction in [Removed]'s [Removed] that allows [Removed] waves. \n I say things like \" Great discoveries often come from realizing the exceptions to former rules, or by stepping back and getting a new perspective. \"","I use canvas instapoll questions. If students choose different answers, I usually invite 1 - 2 students to share their thoughts.","Students are given assignments that make them reflect on who they are, their interest, and activities as they relate to their academic pathway. They are told this in every assignment and throughout most classes.","All assignments were based on identities of culture and race. This was done during all classes in a way that was broadcasted as positive and asset based.","I have new questions in my in - class quizzes where the students get 3 minutes to talk to eachother","I do this every class, as I ask them to guide me through solving problems.","They are offered a second try at each midterm exam.   The second try occurs 2 days after the first so it is fresh in their minds. I always tell them between tries that fixing mistakes is a great way to learn.   Also, the two tries reduces test anxiety.   Everyone has bad days... Personal stories.","The TAs will walk them through the exam this week in discussion.","I include pictures and a research question that we use the statistical analysis method to answer for each example they see in class.   The course packet also contains a set of problems that show how the methods we learn can be used to answer real - world data analysis questions.","I tell my students about my own experience of failure and growth","I will talk about learning to study after a tough exam","By comparing the difficulty level of the materials covered in different midterm exams and showing them why it is important to recongnize even a small improvement","About once a week, I remind students to come to office hours and try to convey what they can expect when they come.","For the mental health class, I will have a student guest speaker from [Removed] [Removed] to talk about their program, provide a link to a meditation video in [Removed], and show a video about gratitude featuring a Black woman.   When I talk about seeking counseling I will mention that students have different views on the value and acceptability of therapy.   For the class on establishing relationships with faculty and staff, I will talk about cultural beliefs related to faculty etiquette.   For every class, I plan to facilitate discussion questions that allow students to present their unique viewpoints and remind them that everyone views class material through the lens of their own experience and identities.","That's what we do each day.","I told the students a bit about me at the beginning of the semester.    Every week I try to talk about something that was hard for me to do.    I am planning to do it again in the middle of the semester.","Retest for each of 3 exams, my main [Removed] thing","I am using zombie problems, that way students will know what are the lowest performing questions and how the concept is helpful in being able to solve a similar question","Students explored databases to analyze a gene and protein of their choice in their second project. Also, many topics covered in the third unit had real - world examples and applications for both courses I teach. \n October and November \n For this project, you'll choose a genetic condition of your interest and identify a protein - coding gene associated with the condition to do some research using the 3 websites provided in the project.","We did a personal values activity during the class that we talked about careers.   This activity had students look at a list of values and tell me about 2 - 3 that are most important to them.    Then discussed how knowing your values can help you decide what careers would be a good fit for them.","I messaged individual students in all my courses who didn't do well on their weekly quizzes after unlocking the quizzes so they can make a second attempt ( which was available to all students but was not used by everyone ). I also did this to students who didn't submit their homework assignments on time and extended their due date. \n October and November \n I see that you did not do so well on the quiz. I extended your quiz until 12 pm today so please give it another try to make improvement. And feel free to reach out to me if there is anything I can do to help you thrive in this course. \n","Students work in small groups ( 3 - 4 students ) to design and conduct experiments.   They work together to collect a soil sample, conduct experiments, and then present their results together at the end of the semester.   Students also use [Removed] to discuss ( on an app ) ethical issues.","Share the results of students' prosocial purpose writing activity \n In the upcoming week \n Thank you for writing about your prosocial purpose and helping me learn about you. I enjoyed reading your reflections and want to share some insights.","I will give a few examples of past students who took the same couse and who have pursued a career in data science after taking this course. Also I will mention that they can present their project to the city of [Removed] if they are putting efforts in their research, showing that they can contribute meaningfully to their local community.","I asked clicker questions and reflection questions that help students develop abilities and skills that can be applied beyond the course. \n Month of October \n Reflection question on exam : We have learned about several important experiments in the second unit. Choose one of the following experiments, describe the purpose and method of that experiment to a family member as your audience. Be clear and concise to help their understanding.","I mention how important it is for me to have them in office hours and make sure to re invite them","In labs and homework assignments, I use data from researchers of diverse backgrounds and give the students information about those scientists.   I also include a picture or video of those researchers in [Removed] or on the lab handout.","  When we covered population dynamics ( week 7 ) and pathogen - host interactions ( week 9 ), I emphasized how the models we cover are the basic models that are used by the [Removed] ( Center for Disease Control ) and the [Removed] Modeling Consortium and other public health institutes. Seeing that many students are pre - health, this connects directly to their careers.","There is graphical or numerical data in each of my lessons. \n I do emphasize the importance of these models. \n The next few week is mellow, but in week 6 - 7 by the end of the week, we will be covering models of delayed density dependence, which reqires abstract thinking. \n\n I usually explain why mathematical models are important to understand the physical world and to make prediction","When discussing climate change and range shift due to climate shift, I used a paper by [Removed] [Removed] - a former [Removed] professor - now world renowned for her work on butterfly range shifts due to climate change. \n\n","Students are directed to reach out to the teaching team in a timely manner to discuss the issue. I try to work with student schedules to facilitate make - up exams whenever possible. For homeworks, I had [Removed] create a token system where any student can give themselves a 24 hour extension on assignments up to three times per semester.","In class I ask them to think how their own life reflects topics we study in ecology. \n\n E.g. [Removed] 5 : \n \" How does living in group ( with room mates ) has both costs and benefits. \" \n I.e. in behavioral ecology, we study cost and benefits of group living for animal species, and how the net benefit results in the optimum group size. \n\n E.g. [Removed] 10 : \n  \" What are resources that you have in your day - to - day life? \" \n I.e. resources are shared and can be used up by others. This is an importamt concept in ecology when we study intra and inter specific competition. They always have great suggestions : place on the bus, in the fridge, clean eating bowls,... \n","I provide re - take exams","Along with the group work in class, I recommend to students to work on homework assignments together.   Also, students must complete lab assignments in assigned groups each week.","I will mention to students that with practice they are all capable of doing well in the course.","We use literature that focuses on experiences that they mostly may have lived. These experiences are based on real - world applications with relationship to education, an experience that they all have gone through as k-12 students and will continue to experience as college students.","Students are always placed in pairs, small groups, or split class for discussions. They have an opportunity to debrief on the readings, share their thoughts and opinions, and present experiences from their own life as it relates to the topic or reading at hand.","We provided resources to help students be successful beyond the classroom as this course is designed to help with the transition into higher education. Students were shared these messages on an almost weekly basis.","I give students the questions about their work during lab several days before labs begin.   They go into lab knowing the data they need to collect and the questions they will need to answer with their data.   I do this each week.   Students should have plenty of time to reflect on their data before answering questions.","Students receive a check in every week. They can provide feedback on their weekly assignments or overall class composition.","Some of our ice breakers talk about professionals in STEM.    Then give the students a chance to talk with each other about their STEM identity.","After each exam, I try to share a personal story, using the belonging stories structure, with the students. So there will be at least 3 of these. I am not sure what story I will tell since I decide based on the feel of the class at the time. I will use language motivated by the belonging stories.","An ice breaker on a fun activity or event that happened over the weekend \n Upcoming week \n I'll give you a couple of minutes to share with your team something fun you did or an interesting event you found over the weekend.","Over the course of the semester, students work together to build a Research Poster that they will present to the class at the end of the semester.   Here are the instructions I provide them : \n\n Your group will present your research at the end of the semester using a poster.   A poster is a visual communication tool that allows you to present your research in a clear, concise, graphic format.   A poster can be created at any stage of your research project.   In fact, creating a poster can aid in focusing your research.   A link to the [Removed] Templates you should use to create your Final Poster are on the [Removed] Page of [Removed].","I have suggested useful youtube modules to review math skill needed in this class","In my large lectures we discuss the value of mistakes in helping to understand the decision process that goes into problem - solving. For my pedagogy courses we touch on specific mistakes and brainstorm changes to behaviors that would mitigate these.","We are having a final project that reflects how physics impacts their lives. I will begin to talk about this in 2 weeks.   I will discuss how the project is meant to reflect their lives and how they see physics as useful, impactful or just fun,","We are about to release their first quiz grades, and I will talk to them about not comparing themselves to others in the class.   And that they can improve on the next one.","I talk about the importance of hearing people say things in different ways, because some phrasings will resonate better sith some people than others.   I also talk about the importance of being engaged and participating for learning, even if an answer offered is incorrect.   Being incorrect is a part of learning.","Students work together in class and with assignments. They share ideas in discussion posts, have a team facilitation assignment, and connect with their peers as they instruct them once a semester.","For every prelecture topic, I ask students to provide a question or comment about it. I then use these to select examples or connections to bring up in class. I also provide my own comment or question about it, and do the same. I also occasionally have the TA or LAs contribute. I also occasionally post articles with connections in [Removed] but I don't know if anyone reads them.","I attended a roundtable discussion on Imposter Syndrome hosted by the [Removed] [Removed] Council and invited all students in my courses. After the event, I shared my insights with students in two courses. \n Oct 17th \n Invitation message : \" Today, the [Removed] [Removed] Council ( [Removed] ) is hosting an [Removed] Syndrome Roundtable from 4 - 5pm at [Removed] Patio. Professors in several departments throughout [Removed] will share their experiences in dealing with [Removed] Syndrome and facing self - doubt in their careers, providing an opportunity for open conversation between students and faculty over refreshments. I will be one of the speakers at the event, and I would love to see you there! If you are interested, please sign up. \"","Everyday in class I have students work with their neighbors on a handful of formative assessments that I pose to them. I specifically mention to students that they should talk to their neighbors to help each other learn the material better.","One of the examples that I showed students more recently during our discussion of moments of inertia is that how a single number can tell us some very important details about a planet. This was an attempt to bring in a real - world example of how we determine interior structures of planets by calculating their moments of inertia.","I have statements in my syllabus about reaching out to me and/or the TA if they are unable to meet a deadline or miss a quiz.   I am typically very flexible, regardless of the reason, in granting extensions or make - ups.","Almost every class has a message from a former student","Notes are posted online, with listed topics, as well as extra problem help.","always make sure to encourage them to work on the instapolls and examples together before I myself discuss","Its important to draw a connection between topics and real world examples or applications. This is one of the criteria we are assessed on in yearly observations, but more so it helps students frame understanding and sort information.","In [Removed] [Removed], students interpret data when I present certain concepts using graphs. They also interpret mathematical models when we talk about [Removed] [Removed] equilibrium equation, logistic and exponential population growth. \n I usually start the lecture mentioning that we will cover the mathematical component of the course. In addition, I try to convey to students that mathematical models are working hypothesis that use numbers instead of words to convey ideas.","Actually, this is not related to this particular project, but a different project. \n I am using muddiest point polls every week to assess what students perceive as difficult and create a handout / study guide for those topic. It's one way in which instructors can use AI in teaching. \n\n I do this every week. Polls are open Monday - Wednesday for content from the previous week. \n I create the handout by Friday. \n I need to prompt them to review the materials and give details on what they did not understand. \n E.g. if I have spent three lectures on' competition' and they just say' competition' it's hard to know what they don't understand.","Working through old exam problems in class","Ha, I plan to use the survey - explaining that its use us to help evaluate the practices in this course.","We will do this today as feedback from their first exam.","I emphasize the course structure that includes Replacement Exams, vs. a cumulative final exam. Students can learn from their first time taking an exam on Unit 1 material, for example, and then replace that exam grade at the end of the semester. Students can learn from past mistakes and misconceptions, and conquer the Unit 1 material the second time around.","I sometimes asked students to discuss a question or problem in pairs and other times to discuss as a team ( 5 - 7 students ). \n October and November \n Please discuss this question in pairs with your teammates. Please discuss this problem with your team before we go over it together.","For each lecture I make sure to break the lecture up into segments so that students can talk to their neighbors about the material. This can be for more formal situations like doing an [Removed] question, but I also have students talk to their neighbors as I lecture through the material particularly when I know the concept in question can be confusing. I have students talk to their neighbors to check to see if they are both clear on the topic.","We are doing this by using [Removed] [Removed] during lecture. So far, I have not used instapoll in every lecture. I am planning to use it more often in future lectures.","By using the reasults from the first [Removed] survey","I have designed [Removed] 206L so that students have a chance to learn a technique ( and make mistakes ) and then, the following week, they conduct the experiment ( and hopefully not make mistakes ).   I emphasize, whenever possible, that making mistakes is a natural part of learning, and that students are not penalized for making mistakes.   Students are given the opportunity to practice a variety of techniques such as serial dilutions, microscopy, Gram - staining, and [Removed] and gel electrophoresis before they use the techniques to examine their soil bacteria.","I ask \" what are your questions? \" and then have a long pause, frequently during class.   I also specifically ask for suggestions or answers to questions that I pose from students who haven't talked yet that day or that week."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>practice_id<\/th>\n      <th>practice_wording<\/th>\n      <th>or.inst_priority<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"practice_id","targets":1},{"name":"practice_wording","targets":2},{"name":"or.inst_priority","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
