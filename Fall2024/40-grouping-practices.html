<p>There are a few ways we might consider grouping practices together. Below we present some of these ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Based on Eric’s coding of semi-reasonable grouping</li>
<li>Based on exploratory factor analysis of correlated responses (student-level)</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>3-factor model</li>
<li>7-factor model</li>
<li>11-factor model</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Based on exploratory factor analysis of correlated responses (course-level)</li>
<li>Based on linguistic similarity</li>
</ol>
<section id="erics-grouping" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="erics-grouping"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Eric’s grouping</h2>
<section id="correlation-matrix-of-unordered-practices" class="level3" data-number="4.1.1">
<h3 data-number="4.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="correlation-matrix-of-unordered-practices"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Correlation matrix of unordered practices</h3>
<p>Below, you’ll see some evidence that those items within the same group are more highly correlated. However, this could be an artifact of those items being presented on the same page to reduce student cognitive load.</p>
<p>You can zoom in on the graph below, or double-click to zoom out. On hover, you can see the pearson correlation between practice reporting.</p>
