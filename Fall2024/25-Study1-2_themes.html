<p><strong>Analysis.</strong> AI-assisted summaries using ChatGPT and NotebookLM were produced from the de-identified open responses. The research team discussed these summaries, consolidated them into 20 initial practices and refined the wording language. Ten undergraduate STEM students and four instructors then participated in cognitive pretesting sessions using think-aloud methods. Students and instructors were asked to interpret and react to the 20 items, focusing on clarity, phrasing, and feasibility. These discussions revealed ambiguous language and minor redundancies, prompting revisions to item wording before testing in Study 2.</p>
<p>Below you can find the themes produced by NotebookLM using the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As a social psychological researcher with qualitative expertise, you are tasked with analyzing the dataset attached, which contains answers to the questions about instructional practices in a college STEM course. The students first provide a rating 1-5 for 6 different experiences in the course:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>self.efficacy:</strong> This course makes students feel capable of learning challenging course material.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>relevance:</strong> This course makes students feel like what they are learning in this class is valuable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>connection:</strong> This course makes students feel connected to instructors and peers in the course.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>id.safety:</strong> This course makes students feel like their backgrounds and who they are will support their academic success.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>expectations:</strong> This course makes students feel like professionals who can succeed in the field or discipline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>regard:</strong> This course makes students feel cared for as individuals with lives outside of this course.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After rating they were first asked: (1) “What is one specific thing about the course or something that happened in the course that made you feel this way?” And then, asked to reflect further: “What moment or story comes to mind?” Your goal is to provide the 4 most common clear instructional practices based on how students answered the questions: things that the instructor could or say in their courses.</p>
<p>After analyzing the dataset, follow these steps: 1. List the practices you have identified, along with a brief description for each practice. 2. For each practice, list 4 example student responses that belong to it 3. Remove any identifying information about the instructor, student, or school (i.e.&nbsp;proper nouns) 4. Report this output so that I could easily copy-paste into an excel file, with columns “practice”, “description”, “example1”, “example2”, “example3”, “example4”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below you can find output from this procedure with the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Context:</strong> (PWI, HSI, HBCU)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>(Note that PWI is split into URM and Non-URM)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Experience:</strong> When students were asked about one of the relevant experiences above (e.g.&nbsp;self-efficacy), was the experience High(“A lot” or “A great deal”, i.e., good) or Low (“Not at all” or “A little”, i.e.&nbsp;neutral or bad).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practice:</strong> What four themes did NotebookLM create based on resposnes from that subgroup?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> What descriptions for these themes did NotebookLM create?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quote 1-4:</strong> Which exact quotes from students did NotebookLM provide relevant to that theme (Up to 4)</p></li>
</ul>
