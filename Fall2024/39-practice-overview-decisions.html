<p>In the table below, you can find our most recent practice items, and whether chatGPT 4o could find a relevant quote from our students’ open responses, split by college (and only including URM students from PWI).</p>
<p><strong>You can see specific quotes by hovering over the setting (e.g., put your cursor over “-HBCU” in Study 1 Quotes column) </strong></p>
<p>For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice A3.2</strong> could be identified in all settings in both studies.</li>
<li><strong>Practice A4.3</strong> has some quotes, but not clearly in line with the practice asked</li>
<li><strong>Practice A14.4</strong> Only seemed to show up in the PWI setting in Studies 1 &amp; 2.</li>
