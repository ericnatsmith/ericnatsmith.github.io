In Pilot 1, STEM instructors at three institutions— a predominantly White institution (PWI), a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI), and a historically Black college/university (HBCU)—to provide a survey to their current students. A total of 754 students across these institutions completed a survey about a STEM course they were currently enrolled in or had previously taken. Of these participants, 667 were from the PWI, 48 from the HSI, and 38 from the HBCU. Although the sample had relatively few students from the HSI and HBCU, the team closely examined open-ended responses from these smaller groups to ensure coverage of their experiences and conducted follow-up interviews with students from these institutions.\nProcedure. Students were randomized to describe either the STEM course that most motivated or least motivated them to pursue the field further. They elaborated on how that course influenced one or more of six psychological experiences: self-efficacy, STEM identity, relevance, connectedness, identity safety, and broad regard. These reports were complemented by semi-structured student interviews and a review of relevant literature.",

In Pilot 2, 12 instructors across the same institutions had 3,010 unique students participate in the survey. Again, the data was skewed towards the PWI, with 2,298 from the PWI (702 of which were URM), 411 from the HSI, and 35 from the HBCU.\nProcedure. Both instructors and students completed surveys approximately four and nine weeks into the semester, typically aligning with the first and second midterm exams. Students completed a questionnaire measuring the presence of the 20 practices in their course and evaluating which practices should be prioritized by the instructor.\nA subset of open-ended responses were read through by the research team to capture specific moments in the course when a practice was evident and create a list of themes present in students’ open responses. While we did not calculate formal inter-rater reliability due to the exploratory nature of the coding, multiple researchers independently reviewed responses, and AI-assisted summaries helped elaborate on common themes.",

There were 3697 unique students across 49 course/groups with 23 instructors participating, all at a single PWI.\nIn the table below, you can find course demographics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure. Building on insights from Study 2, the research team assembled a broader set of 56 potential practices that were intended to be more precise. Each student was asked about 20 of these practices, and half of the sample was given the choice of selecting an “unsure” option rather than only “yes” or “no.” For data analysis, the “unsure” responses were initially treated as “no” with the assumption that “unsure” responses were more biased more by overall “feelings” in the course rather than objective instructor behaviors occurring. Instructors provided self-reports on the same items, but these data were not the principal focus of this pilot.",

The research team discussed these summaries, consolidated them into 20 initial practices and refined the wording language. Ten undergraduate STEM students and four instructors then participated in cognitive pretesting sessions using think-aloud methods. Students and instructors were asked to interpret and react to the 20 items, focusing on clarity, phrasing, and feasibility. These discussions revealed ambiguous language and minor redundancies, prompting revisions to item wording before testing in Study 2.\nBelow you can find the themes produced by NotebookLM using the following prompt:\nBelow you can find output from this procedure with the following columns:\nYou can find an excel version of this table at this Box link.\nAlso note that you can hover over any quote to see the full quote",

The students first provide a rating 1-5 for 6 different experiences in the course:\n\nself.efficacy: This course makes students feel capable of learning challenging course material.\nrelevance: This course makes students feel like what they are learning in this class is valuable.\nconnection: This course makes students feel connected to instructors and peers in the course.\nid.safety: This course makes students feel like their backgrounds and who they are will support their academic success.\nexpectations: This course makes students feel like professionals who can succeed in the field or discipline.\nregard: This course makes students feel cared for as individuals with lives outside of this course.\n\nAfter rating they were first asked: (1) “What is one specific thing about the course or something that happened in the course that made you feel this way?” And then, asked to reflect further: “What moment or story comes to mind?” Your goal is to provide the 4 most common clear instructional practices based on how students answered the questions: things that the instructor could or say in their courses.\nAfter analyzing the dataset, follow these steps: 1. List the practices you have identified, along with a brief description for each practice. 2. For each practice, list 4 example student responses that belong to it 3. Remove any identifying information about the instructor, student, or school (i.e. proper nouns) 4.

    "text": "3.1 Summary of Results\nWe concluded that there was a relatively high level of positive reporting and conceptual overlap between practices collected. We find evidence of a positive-reporting bias among student responses, such that students reported a high mean level of practices occurring. Across all items, most students report a vast majority of practices occurring: the modal response from students was that all 20 practices had occurred, and the majority of participants reported that at least 80% of practices had occurred (16 of 20). Follow-up qualitative and quantitative analyses suggest that we were not fully capturing the absence of practices within courses, even when there is no clear evidence of the practice occurring, which reduces our power of differentiating between courses and being able to link student-reports with observer-reports of practices.\nFor more details you can see additional results and information in the Research Summary sent to our Advisory Board LINK and a summary of analyses of open-responses conducted by Sarah Leckey LINK",
